ClevTA,like how can u not see this? let me ask u this. whats a better outcome- browns kick a  field goal  but theres no time left for seattle to get the ball back. or go no huddle hurry up score a  touchdown  then sea gets it back  also scores a  touchdown ? which is better? this is the last of our convo
aluckyaday,they understand the math very well. why take bets with a hold of 2 percent  when you can take bets with 5 percent ....10 percent .....20 percent . to do this you often have to offer value elsewhere. dangle the hook. but you only allow this value to be taken by people you know are going to give it back plus some

LeeSharpeNFL,"the latter point is good and i kind of regret jumping in now.

re the former: not everyone can code but you  daily fantasy sports  have to know how to code to have some sense of what expected points added is doing to see it or use it to help contextualize the game. ben's box scores are a good example of this."
LeeSharpeNFL,"why are they kicking? you had 1st down and 13 seconds to throw at least twice. if you were going to kick the  field goal  from thst spot you should have just done it on 4th and 1.

but i wouldn't have attempted a  field goal  at all. just keep going for the  touchdown  until you get it or clock runs out."

SportsCheetah,yeah the best bets have done poorly. people like to ignore all of the other ones too. anita already hit a +450 prop in mlb game ive had two different fridays  college football  went 6-0 but only one counts as a best bet etc. the bear had 13-0  college football  run only 3 counted. my nats 6/1 nl + series +$
ClevTA,dvoa is adjusted for schedules. they arent raw numbers. either way i am not sure it matters who u play if u allow 78 percent  completions and 8.4 yds/att. i know dallas is improved but are we ready to say their pass o is one of the best in the nfl? philly is a good but not gr8 pass o too

spanky,this is 100 percent  correct. i just did a rough calculation and the break even point on a 2 point conversion rate would be 38.2 percent  which is way below league average of slightly under 50 percent ... in other words if the giants can convert the 2 point conversion 38.2 percent  of the time they should go for it

adamchernoff,a play is graded successful on 3rd/4th down when it picks up a 1st down. since the week 8 bye bal has a passing success rate on 3rd/4th of 65 percent . the league best mark is 25 percent  better than league average 13 percent  better than 2nd place (min) and 23 percent  higher than their week 1-7 mark (11th).

ClevTA,ravens up to 3.5 is a bit inflated imo. thats implying theyd be 7.5-8.5 at home assuming u dont think much of las hfa. ravens have faced one top 11 and 2 top 20 defenses on the road. lost to kc (5.8 yds/pl on o)  needed overtime to beat hodges  co (3.8 yds/pl on o). la 8th on d
ClevTA,browns used 2-0 (2 rbs/0 te) and 2-1 (2 rbs/1 te) personnel 28 times combined last week. they ran the ball 13 times for 126 yards (9.7 ypc) and 77 percent  success rate. pit opponents have run the ball out of 2-0 and 2-1 56 times for 52 percent  success rate (league avg is 46 percent ). hello kareem
ClevTA,numbers on rookie qbs on thursday night in the first half of a season are beyond ugly. since 2000 2-8 w/l 2  touchdown s 10 ints 52 percent  comp 5.6 ypa. none had ypa higher than 6.4. russ had the worst gm imaginable his rookie yr. 9-23 122 yds and 1 int. i had high hopes for minshew too
ClevTA,i dont care if nobody agrees. this is an absolute must win for the browns. u cant be 0-1 heading into ny on monday night football  then home to the rams on the road in balt and on the road on a cross country trip to sf on monday night football . 1-0 affords u so much more cushion
spanky,many pros i know advise to never bet more than 1 percent  of your bankroll.  im closer to that number being .5 percent . the math nerds on here may say im too conservative but most of them write about this shit while ive been in the trenches for the last 19 years making a living out of it.
aluckyaday,a big difference between someone who regularly beats the closing line and one who does not. bankroll has little to do with it. if you stake big but  daily fantasy sports  have closing line value the soft books will treat you like a king. shower you with gifts vip trips. stake $50 with closing line value and its goodbye....
LeeSharpeNFL,"how much of that is advantages of the bye (having to win one less game rest) vs. the fact that teams with a bye tend to be better teams?

i give no as 72 percent  to defeat min. if that happens i have them as a favorite in gb as well. despite the rest/hfa no is the better team."
logan_matthews9,"went to nj for the super bowl - and there were a ton of bad beats to spread around but the one that got me:

will jlo and shakira twerk - no

somebody needs to either find me a clip of this or learn the definition of the word because no way this shouldve been graded as a loss"
PikachuBets,did you just compare jumbo bozos to billy walters. they  daily fantasy sports  move the market. they  daily fantasy sports  bet their own picks. there is nothing to fucking middle if you  daily fantasy sports  move the market. lol. dude you can't read espn chalk articles  use these fancy words when you  daily fantasy sports  know what they mean
PikachuBets,"wat? no one is saying unit size matters. the guy was just saying you suck at betting. ""just above 50 percent "" does not win 51.5 percent  does not win. if you can't beat 52.4 percent  at -110 then you're going to lose big. unit count will keep magnifying at 52.4 percent  the more bets you make. c'mon jeff"
PikachuBets,he also did the wrong shelter lol. been so long since i dmed him the paypal links that the tokens expired so he prob scrambled to google a shelter and donated to a nearby one not the one i sent to him. its no biggie but it just shows he didnt do it when i sent him the links
adamchernoff,with the focus of the buckets approach on organizing work game by game and week by week i still felt that i had a bit of a void in terms of organizing my thoughts on the league as a whole. this year i took on the style of power ratings as show in the picture to lead the thread.
Ccon8181,not going to pump my chest on about getting a cover on the over as it was a dead under with both teams scoring 83 in the second half. however it shouldve been a 2-1 day no matter what if siakam hits some free throw up 2 with seconds left. but ill take a gifted 3-0 over earned 2-1
kellyinvegas,my best bet has been the same all week. my second bet is a better number now. and my third just won outright. bears (loser) i gave out at 4.5 which is where it closed. i do my best to not give out games that move too much. and sometimes i get info that talks me off a game.
ToddFuhrman,so why wouldn't you run the risk of going for 2 miss you're still up 1.  next possession you score a  touchdown  and can go for 2 again to take it from 7 to 9; being up 3 means more than worrying about the subsequent score to be up 9 when the 9 would still be on the table
ToddFuhrman,"i get that part but i've always been of the mindset (logistically speaking well aware of the hurdles) why not build a  college football  challenge schedule that rotates ly seeds match-up

year 1: sec vs big ten acc vs pac 12 big 12 vs aac
year 2: sec vs acc pac 12 vs big 12 aac vs big ten"
RufusPeabody,"oh i do bet totals. and i  daily fantasy sports  know how you think there was ""no shot"" of it going to 8 when 8.5 to 8 is a much smaller move than 8.5 to 9 and lineups had not been announced. so if the total had dropped to 8 you'd have had under 8 as the play?"
ClevTA,"bc i always think stats need to be used in context for schedule of opponents:
michigan:

run o (yds per carry) 72nd opp run d sked rank 14th toughest
pass o (yds per att) 24th opp pass d sked rank 20th toughest

run d 9th opp run o rank 58th 
pass d 12th opp pass o rank 92nd"
ClevTA,weve been hammering browns for not using more 12 personnel since preseason yet kitchens refuses to adjust. 8/9 (89 percent ) success rate vs ne out of 12. more fuel- den has allowed 5.3 ypc  47 percent  success rate to teams running out of 12 13th worst in the nfl. 3rd best d vs run out of 11
ClevTA,moral of the story last night. russ is amazing as always maybe the most valuable player in the nfl. bc that ol and defense are absolute garbage as i suspected in the preseason. such a luck box team to be 4-1 w/only +15 point diff. and of course 1-3 against the spread as favs. i'll keep fading them
ClevTA,stupid block on my part. i was annoyed. but u know nothing about me or who i work for or what i do. but the best part is u follow me  i dont know u from a hole in the wall. so u follow me why? i have good analysis or bc of my good looks? honest q
spanky,not sure you understood me so ill break it down. you bet $100 on the side u hate say -5. they go to 5.5. you then bet x in your friends account +5.5.   you now have position of x-100 on +5.5 and 100 each on -5 and +5.5.  the small $100  bets probably cancel costing you only $10
aluckyaday,they are based on the same stake as a lucky 15 so 15 points across a group of 4 selections. distributed across either 4 bets for singles 6 bets for doubles 4 bets for the trebles 1 bet for the acca or 15 bets for the full cover. kelly is used to determine how the 15 is split.
aluckyaday,i'd like to know what the plans are for border if there is no deal. watched the peter taylor documentary sunday and it reminded me how big an issue it really is. i actually believe it is all a boris bluff. i  daily fantasy sports  think he intends to leave without one. but he is playing with fire
aluckyaday,well i try to do it properly. but i would not really call myself a tipster. just someone who is helping recreational bettors add a +ev bet to their mainly negative expected value ones in a very easy way. contrary to gambling twitter beliefs most bettors are negative expected value punters who do it for fun not profit
EdMillerPoker,"i think if  it is  well-built it will find its niche for sure. my only point is that  it is  hard/expensive to build well and operate and poorly built i  daily fantasy sports  think it has much for legs.

i think ppl will indeed go the huge hold route on it and therefore it will be v self-limiting"
LeeSharpeNFL,"rufus do you mind (totally reasonable if you  daily fantasy sports  want to obviously) sharing your individual game  percent  for baltimore? to get to 43 percent  you would have to have something in the range of:

90 percent  to win divisional
70 percent  to win afccg
70 percent  to win super bowl

those seem very high to me."
LeeSharpeNFL,"once i waited at a vegas sportsbook for the conclusion of a boring week 17 sunday night football game to collect win total bet winnings.

the result was certain the teams in the  sunday night football  game weren't ones i had bet on. the counter just refused to pay me out until the  sunday night football  game ended."
LeeSharpeNFL,likely true but i hope this changes overall as teams go for 4th down more. this is why i like treating the respondent variable as true if they  daily fantasy sports  get it on 3rd but do get it on 4th that way it gets captured if it is real. and if not the adjustment likely doesn't matter.

SportsCheetah,haha i clearly stated yesterday with this exact thing in mind let me make it clear i havent bet the jets but youd be paying a premium to bet the ravens now at -17 when it was -15 all week. its a pass or trying to buy the peak jets number. then i talked about the matchup.

ClevTA,only clicked on a couple but there are times on a kickoff after a score there's a fumble for example.  that is  an easy way. or a fumble or int early in the next drive after the kickoff. u essentially need a decent amount of luck or a really fast 3 and out and a big play

aluckyaday,it should but their tcs say that they  daily fantasy sports  have to and you agreed to their terms when you placed the bet. i doubt you will have much luck perusing this unless 50/1 was close to the price offered by other books when you placed the bet. arbitration will just rule based on tcs gl
aluckyaday,it is a shame you  daily fantasy sports  record bfsp for the win and place. then you could see how the theoretical edge was proportioned between the two. a bit late to do it now and a pain in the arse to go back and do it retrospectively though especially as the place terms are not consistent
joeytunes2,good for  for saying that the broncos are scared of losing.  it is  so true. all these coaches for so long are scared to lose rather then finishing teams off.  we all know the nfl is a one score league. and  it is  not hard to get in  field goal  range. these guys kick 67 yard bombs

RufusPeabody,"we're betting on a coin flip. i offer two options:

(a) flip a coin. if  it is  heads you win. if  it is  tails you lose.

or

(b) flip a coin. if  it is  heads you win. if  it is  tails you flip twice more. if both come up heads you win. if not you lose."
capjack2000,the market ahead of game 1 echoed mack's path around town. he bet late and the market adjusted from -180 to -200. he didn't bet dk on game 1. heading into game 2 it was obvious mack would be on the series price. it started at -110 and got pushed to -130. he went to ms.
capjack2000,16 percent  is relatively middle of the road from what we've seen so far. we've seen as low as 6 percent  and as high as 36 percent . the effect it has on the lines offered is yet to be proven. seems likely that the increased overhead gets passed onto the customers one way or another.
dinkinc,it really depends on how much business you have ...if you have as many customers as  has outs you will always find one who will bet the other side.. then  it is  up to you to evealuate the two players to see if you should move the line back down.. also be aware of the market
dinkinc,please realize that about 98 percent  of the people who gamble lose and that you are probably not in the top 2 percent  as far as math and coding skills... you would be best off to search for places with weak lines that no one sharp has access to.. that is my advice for the day
suuma810,"i would argue that they can also play man with the fs hovering closer to the first down marker instead of back pedalling even deeper. a slant seems like an easy touchdown with the fs that deep.

i would expect the fs to be at least a threat to take away the middle of the field."
ClevTA,thats a whole lot of faith in drew lock. i dont like that miller is getting old and harris may be out on d too. give tampa just an adequate qb and they are my pick. a highly improved d  we already know the o weapons are there. betting on the come but thats my pick
ClevTA,colts outgain tennessee 5.8 to 5.0 yds/play with their top 3 wrs out and mack out at rb. indy has one missed  field goal  and 2 others blocked with one returned for a  touchdown  on the go ahead   field goal  to potentially win the gm. but all of the sudden the titans are sleeper contenders lol
ClevTA,9 times out of 10 based on circumstances the browns would be a an obvious spot to win but this short week from the west coast travel vs a team playing on  thursday night football   really screws things up for them. its too bad bc this is typically an ideal spot vs an overrated seattle tm
ClevTA,i'll have a write up later but eagles +4 from me tonight. hit it on monday but couldnt post bc i was originally planning on using it in the supercontest then i backed off. gb o just isnt good. 30th in drive success rate. helps to also lead the nfl in to margin  have short fields
ClevTA,i think its dangerous to only use a 15 gm sample where he had zero prep time and a bottom 5 ol/ overall roster to make any conclusions. also avg depth of tgt is absolutely a product of bad ol. its prob an outlier but same comp numbers were horrible for goff after 1 year too
ClevTA,i think the gurley v zeke comp is debatable but zeke actually had a down year last year when u dig into his numbers a bit. he had the lowest  touchdown  percent  among all rbs inside the 10 20th in success rate  although he caught more passes his yds/rec was by far his lowest in career
spanky,when i bet mayweather to beat mcgregor i wasnt happy that i won. i was happy that i didnt lose.  most bettors have limited bankroll and could go broke. no average joe should bet 7 times their normal unit to win 1 unit but instead bet their normal 1 unit to win 1/7th of a unit.
aluckyaday,why? is contract law in the us different to the rest of the world? any contract has to be consented to by both parties. in no other industry can you force a company to enter in to a contract with you that they do not want to. prices are an invitation to treat not an offer.
aluckyaday,i would not argue for it because i would not need to. but i would understand why those arguing for it are doing so. i would not object to it happening. if i though i had won the referendum fairly and thought it was in the peoples interest i would not be scared of another vote.
aluckyaday,this is the issue that seems to have been missed by everyone. the eu may do a lot of trade with the uk as a whole but for each individual country it is quite a small percentage. whereas for the uk.... basically uk is screwed if it leaves with no deal eu countries not so much.
aluckyaday,unlike a lot of punters i have no issues with books that restrict. it is not the job of a soft book to lay bets from sharp punters. it is their job to market the industry to new punters and bring in as much recreational cash as possible. it is this cash that pays for everything!
aluckyaday,freedom. size of market decides who is a rule maker or rule taker in international trade we are a large part of the eu and have a influential say in one of the global rule makers. outside it we are minnow. we go from a rule maker to a rule taker. is that freedom or incarceration?
EdMillerPoker,but change the law to what? not trying to be annoying and broadly i agree with you. i agree its terrible optics and all my work in the space is to build stuff to enable things to be done the right way. but ive thought a lot about how to legislate this and come up empty.
EdMillerPoker,"not meant to be negative i kinda like the boot camps and i think they get roasted unfairly.

i just read the blurb on your event.. sounds interesting. to me the "" daily fantasy sports  plan to do this again"" part seems like the key piece if you really want to deliver roi to your attendees."
nonrandomalpha,indeed total is more than a  touchdown  off the high. the only reasonable play from a total perspective at this point is the over - but will likely be even better to take live. if we get a couple opening clumsy drives from both teams this will dip fast to 40.5 - which is my target
nonrandomalpha,jax had 50+ sacks in 17 + then barely 30 in 18. going into 18 many believed sacksonville would be just as if not more potent than it was in 17 and compete for a super bowl. regression is mean bitch but in a sport that is as random as football it is a real phenomenon.
LeeSharpeNFL,"if pit wins both pit gets it. if pit loses both ten gets it.

if pit goes 1-1 and ten beats hou then ten gets it. if pit goes 1-1 and ten loses to hou then pit gets it. 

today could change whether ten gets it on record or tiebreakers but not whether they get it."
LeeSharpeNFL,"for the division huge change for sf and sea with that win. nfc west can go to either sf or sea at this point with sea just half a game behind. loser a huge  percent  to be a wildcard.

dal/phi gb/min kc/oak are more competitive races ind loss makes that one less (vs. hou off bye)."
AndyMSFW,this spring i took the basis for a set of algorithms i was using for  college basketball  and tried to convert it to the nba.  it told me that the knicks were the best team in my power rankings.  this is just a long way of saying that not every handicapping angle translates across leagues etc.
LockyLockerson,"gb-bal: harbaugh seems to cover every game which is probably why this is a little higher.  i'd actually rather just sell the hook here because  it is  not too valuable.  gb +3 +100 for 1x and gb +151 for 1x more.

also the total is right on the border so we'll play that. o 37 1x."

DannyParkins,"in 2017 kareem hunt was a 3rd round rookie with matt nagy as his offensive coordinator and he had 272 carries for a league leading 1327 yards with 8  touchdown s. he also caught 53 balls for 455 yards and 3  touchdown s.

what will 3rd round rookie david montgomery do with nagy as his coach?"
DannyParkins,again you fail to show specifics. ive given you ample opportunity to do so and you name call. i stand by what i said on the show and on here. i showed you my actual work with dv which you ignore. im sure you hate dv more than everyone. going into dinner have a good one.
DannyParkins,so the maximum number of points the leading team can score in the 4th quarter of the all star game is 24 points? am i reading this right? the 4th quarter of last years asg was 46-33. the goal of this was to shorten the 4th quarter which was the only competitive part of the game?
PikachuBets,"you literally post things like ""under 7.5/8"" when there is not an 8 to be found in the world at time of writing. you claim off lines at the wynn for your record. you fool nobody mr. ""here's my fave wager on nym that i myself did not bet bc i am too busy cucking myself"""
adamchernoff,thanks again for listening. botched the cle o v cin d breakdown and cracked up at the end. mitch was pushing me towards a total - i know where he wanted me to go but the number might come down a tick or two yet! will share more on that one this weekend. enjoy the games.
adamchernoff,no they sure havent. i was a bit worried about the fangio murmurs. good to see the wind over the key number of 20mph. same situation as the phi buf game. phi ran 40+ because of it right into the weakness of the buf d. could set den up to run even more today. go broncos
adamchernoff,"i know it exists in api's from data providers but why does no live score service/app have total possessions and points per possession as a tab in their box score for college basketball? 

(pts) / ( field goal a - oreb + to + (0.4 * fta)) 

 it is  not too much to ask is it?"
adamchernoff,"mindset of what was mentioned above or do a bulk of those people stay away falsely assuming this is the fictional ""trap spot""? the 49ers are also featured in a monday night football  game at home vs seattle. how does perception carry over and how do people view sf on a short week? for me these..."
adamchernoff,team that is currently viewed as a -4 but can play up to a -8 but now lower than a -3. at that point i can begin to evaluate the current market and spot opportunities based on the specific matchup for that week. for me it is always important to look at a game multiple ways.
adamchernoff,only issue i see is that the eagles are in the nfc east. in order for an nfc team to win the super bowl they must beat the afc champion and the jets are in the afc. so it would be difficult to bet on an nfc side considering the upside the jets present at 2500/1.
12Xpert,if no government can be formed after 2 weeks then there's ge to find one. at which point all bets are off as to what happens. about the only thing i am fairly confident is that brexit won't happen unless the eu let it and they won't let it because  it is  too dangerous for them.
12Xpert,"""the proof of whether it works or not is in the profit.""

 daily fantasy sports  follow tipsters like this. this single quote exposes how little they understand. if you  daily fantasy sports  understand why take the trouble to find out and if you can't be bothered give up betting unless you do it just for fun."

RufusPeabody,"milo wants to bet 10k on a game at +7 -110 or better. retail shops wont take his action. 

coco wants to bet 10k on the same game at -7 -110 or better. retail shops wont take her action.

in no sane world should this be an issue.

(fictitious names courtesy top 10 dog names)"
RufusPeabody,most years in mlb there are one or two teams that win 100 games. yet no teams are projected to win 100 games prior to the season starting. similarly there will be bettors that hit 60 percent  and those that hit 40 percent . doesn't mean they are fundamentally 60 percent  or 40 percent  bettors.
RufusPeabody,i have/had no way of knowing whether the person was a subscriber or not (nor do i know whether your subscribers are happy or not). what i do know is long term you'll either be moving lines with your release (if your picks provide real value) or you won't (if they  daily fantasy sports )...
SportsCheetah,i didnt chime in yesterday about the cfp but lsu was impressive as hell and im not sure how beating 2 of the 3 best teams of the last 3 years along with 2 more (auburn uf) on par with ohio states best wins  while going undefeated in countrys best conf  doesnt put them #1.
SportsCheetah,my first instinct was their general style of play so i made a note to check a few things out.  it is  way more significant than i had thought. last season minnesota took 63.6 percent  of their shots at the rim or from 3. it was the second-lowest in the entire nba (spurs dead last).
SportsCheetah,i was clarifying because doug said i went all-in on the bulls total. he knew i had bet it bigger but i didnt want people going ham on it at the current number. market is going to move sometimes its while the show is going (sparty 6 to 5.5 for example) and they have show
capjack2000,"if you want to tie up some money for the next 5 months and earn 0.54 percent  yield. you can bet oak to win the super bowl at fanduel at +22000 and lay against oak winning the super bowl at foxbet at -10000.

to rec gamblers out there +22000/-10000 looks juicy...but  it is  really not."
dinkinc,"if i  were  i would push   to the moon.. you have made it impossible for anyone on the main roster to be "" the guy ""so you may as well bring in the "" wrestling "" brand and create new stars...give them equal pay and make sure vince is not involved and no evil authority"
ClevTA,so if u are in agreement that hes been just ok overall and the diff between he and darnold is essentially zero then u have to judge dorsey on the rest of his moves right? otherwise whats the value add of his baker over darnold pk? u would be in the same spot either way
ClevTA,again be sharp. give me descriptive details. why would a little noise effect an nba player who doesnt have to travel and plays 41+ games in that same arena. like i want sharp data or info not just i think its a factor. i want u to think outside of the box and be better
ClevTA,mike boone might win some fantasy leagues. gb has been bad on d. 30th in success rate allowed on the ground since week 8. for the season have allowed 6th highest ypc vs a schedule of rbs that ranks 19th. gbs 9 percent  ypc allowed over faced is 6th worst. let the fresh rb roll
ClevTA,3 days later and i still am pissed i didnt take jets +2.5 vs skins. everything told me to take the jets and the matchup was ideal. but the line somehow went from  -1 to -2.5. it baffled me  that kept me off of it. i want to know who and why hammered the skins
ClevTA,that is  where andy reid came from. was never an oc before going to phi  taking them to nfc title gms + sb. my original point was its not like they passed on stud hcs who are really lighting things up right now. among the rookie hcs who has been great that they could've hired?
ClevTA,adjusted comp  percent  was 71 percent  when u consider 3 drops. and thats if u consider that hilliard int as a drop too. was a bad pass. either way 71 percent  when kept clean is still bad. that would rank him 34th out of 37 qbs if that was his full  year adj comp percent
spanky,"im one of the few sharps out there who is still alive at fan duel with decent limits.  why? because i recognize i need them more than they need me.  i give them nfl work. i dont bet any props cuz that would be penny wise and dollar foolish. 

pigs get fat. hogs get slaughtered."
spanky,"to anybody that gives advice on who to bet and why you like this team or that team: anybody with half a brain doesnt give a shit what you think unless you bet your own money.  

i know i just insulted 99.99 percent  of gambling twitter but i gotta keep it real. 

too many know-it-alls"
spanky,assume you have 200k bankroll. super bowl coin toss prop.  shop a deals heads -120 tails +110 10k limit.  shop b dealing heads -102 tails -118 20k limit.  do you bet tails +110 10k heads -102 to win $10396 locking up $396 (ev 396 risk 0) or bet tails +110 10k (ev +500 with risk)
aluckyaday,the fact that they pay him tells you all you need to know about the direction of the us industry. if some books manage to stick to a sharp model good luck to them but the business case for a soft books is much stronger. in the end if corporate types are pulling the strings....
aluckyaday,there are statistical ways to determine what level of confidence you can have in that opinion though. my singles have a p-value (google it) less than 0.005 percent . i.e. there is a 1 in 25000 chance that my bets did not have an edge. i'll take the 1 in 24999 chance that they do!
aluckyaday,i think the current rhetoric should not count for much it is boris ! changing his mind is part of his m.o. especially if he can blame someone else. and he has two to blame when it does not happen. parliament and the eu. blaming either or both would probably work out well for him
joeyisaks,"1) this is the worst ive seen kenin play in months credit to jabbbbeur

2) have u ever been to a tnenis tournament ? when theres 3/4 matches on stadium court no one goes to first match bc you cant go to all the matches just too boring so you go to bar and drink"
EdMillerPoker,"hi chad.

""he does have his eye on not going up a tax bracket and in order to do that he has to keep a sizeable amount in the sportsbook. once he takes it out it counts as winnings.""

i am not a cpa but i believe this is advice that could lead people afoul."
EdMillerPoker,the end result is that you end up being way way more likely to get the bad end of a scalp like that accepted than the good end. if you try to bet both often (in some situations way more than half the time) you'll get the bad side accepted and the good side rejected.
GolcondaFund,"lol  let us  stop conflating the skill set of lj v tebow with who is getting a raw deal argument the guy who has majority apologists or the guy who has majority haters.

tebow's 4q winning drives v lj with game on the line over their 1st 2 seasons? and tebow had fox as hc..."
GolcondaFund,because we have lived through it and are still in it i  daily fantasy sports  think most realize just how all-time bellicheck and brady's run has been across all sports and all time in a game that has 22+ different positions for each team and where the margin for error is was his arm tucked?
nonrandomalpha,we strongly leaned this way as well but it seems like all texans bettors are only looking at this from one side of the ball. where the 7 might go bust is because of slow less than average defense that gets eaten up. on offense a lot of new pieces and chemistry wont be right.
AndyMSFW,probably need to throw normal bankroll management out the window since you have a limited time frame and your competing.   i'm sure there's some proper game theory to this that i  daily fantasy sports  know but i'd say 5 percent -10 percent  of your bank per bet depending on how many you plan on making.
DannyParkins,no but a team cant make anyone take a tweet down only a boss can. a team could pull a press pass or deny an interview request or not put members on a show or whatever as punishment but thats the game. the good ones take criticism and still face the music like the cubs.
DannyParkins,also we fundamentally disagree bc i think if he tore his acl in the title game he'd still set the record setting shoe deal for a rookie and be the number 1 pick. kenyon martin and kyrie irving are examples of precedent. so i might be wrong but i'm backing up the opinion with fact.
Gingfacekillah,it is  set officially for august 17th. i'm working hard to try and finish it and release it by the end of this month. i just  daily fantasy sports  want to over promise and under deliver. however writing is going well and all the models are already built. i expect to release by month end
Gingfacekillah,you'll notice a lot of people happily post forecasts but you  daily fantasy sports  do much analysis when they lose. i watch every game i select. i analyze the data after each game. i try to find ways to correct model deficiencies as a result of this new info. there's a lesson in there somewhere
Gingfacekillah,scoring distribution in nfl is clumped together in bands with some margins of victory much more likely to occur than others (3 7 etc.) this could be a factor. if the closing line is -10 and its off its more likely to be off by a lot (-7 -14 -17) rather than a little (-11).
PikachuBets,what? no. what the fuck are you talking about. when your show goes on the air whatever the line is then thats what you should be using. how are you being transparent? if nobody calls you out then you ride it as if -12 was valid when you were on the air.  what the fuck
PikachuBets,what about that your tos didnt make any mention of the guarantee until like an hour ago? written by you no less. your tos is so fluid that you can just change it on your website in a moments notice. that can happen at any time and you even dont guarantee refunds if it happens
PikachuBets,if my chances as an average coin flipping joe of winning a top-heavy nfl contest are approximately 0.0069 percent  (i  daily fantasy sports  see a reason why circa would be less competitive than supercontest) why do i care how much overlay there is? then on top of that i also have to pay proxy fees
PikachuBets,not gonna circlejerk the same shit about why we think you're disingenuous with your stuff. if you  daily fantasy sports  pull shady shit like internet shopping all of lv for an extra 0.5 or insinuate you could've been a market maker for mlb totals for a decade plus then i have no beef with you.
PikachuBets,"the point about knowing ppl who work at the very local charities i selected is that 1) i picked very small local charities that i care about and 2) doing small shops makes it very easy to call and ask ""hey did you get a $7000 donation?"" can't exactly do that with red cross monsters"
adamchernoff,third consecutive week that a total opened 54.5 (kc v oak) and has been bet down on a monday morning. last two (tb v arz) (tb v atl) hit the key number of 51 and reversed at limit bump on wednesday morning. last year every over was smashed early this year all under early week.
adamchernoff,land based sports books which is what i think is the perception for many in the us based off of las vegas. they are creating web shops. the biggest issue is their web based product is even worse and they do not push that either. in my eight hours there i did not get one...
adamchernoff,the game yesterday opened at -7.5 was immediately bet up to -8 and then there was a clear buy point on widely available prices with better limits on the 49ers which took -8 to -10 and ultimately volume led the price to close at a cheap -10.5. if we remove a standard 3 for hfa
adamchernoff,how you get there is quite a long journey but the quickest way to not get there is believing there is always a secret side to every game you can blindly follow to make you money because bookmakers always win. it is foolish and it is lazy. but  daily fantasy sports  confuse this with tracking...
12Xpert,using wiki there have been 381 sackings to date since inception of premier league. the average time a manager sacked in 2000 had been in place was 666 days. based on the whole data set this was below par (which was 810 days). in 2019 it is 613 days which is above par (536 days).
mschwimer,again. we have money in a bank account that has nothing to do with expenses. that money is only there to pay back people if we end up losing. which is why we can only take x number of subs. then we will have to stop because we dont have enough in case we lose.
mschwimer,watch my interviews. i was sure the betting community would go bananas. that is why i created the system! if you think its bullshit then put your money where your mouth is!!! if your right you get 10k. if not you lose 3k. why wouldnt you do this? other than not believing what you say
mschwimer,very easy answer. they say no tout has a system that works. if they did then they would bet themselves.  simple answer. if you actually believe that you should be the #1 person to sign up. cost 3k if wrong but +10k if you r right. put your $ where your mouth is. we do
mschwimer,we also line shop because that is what our subscribers want. we started by using only 1 book but the overwhelming feedback was our subscribers wanted to know where the best line was so that is what we do now.  hope to have 2 record tabs. one for best line and one using 1 book.
RufusPeabody,if my math is right after the 10 percent  fee to the seller this means the seller is essentially hedging at a price of +138.4. yikes! only way this makes sense for the seller is if they are risk averse and  daily fantasy sports  have access to a book (or enough $$ to hedge).
SportsCheetah,phx u29.5 +110 - somebody in the west is going to win 20 games and i think the suns are an obvious candidate. seen some recent love for them as a 2019 sac kings type year... i guess  it is  possible? unlikely though. projected toughest sos in the nba. under if i had to.
capjack2000,"they have sixers +5.5 but you have to lay $25 to win $10. is that a good compromise? well you'd have to be a fairly sharp bettor to know the value of each point between. 

why not just offer sixers -2 like the rest of the world?

...and foxbet is supposedly a ""fun sportsbook."""
capjack2000,i get it. youre incentivized to talk nice about them. it enables you to put out good content about sports (which you do). i just hate to see an independent site whos not afraid to speak truth to power take an overtly shill approach and talk up an advertiser in a story like that
capjack2000,i guess  it is  time to read the fine print of the iowa sports regulations. it was bound to come up sooner or later. my guess is they will resemble nj in that there is no unilateral power given to the operator and the regulatory body will need to approve or deny wager cancellation.
capjack2000,"i'm sure dk will pass around a hat if letting me bet $500 on an nfl game will bankrupt the company....the company that currently has a $1.5 billion valuation. 

if the hat isn't enough they're screwed. that online casino they run and the  daily fantasy sports  with 11 percent  rake won't pay the bills."
capjack2000,there is definitely a middle ground that can be reached. for instance my previous limit from mgm was $500.  that is  less than i want to bet but at the same time isn't insulting. i was ok with that limit. this latest restriction was a bridge too far for me - hence the blast.
dinkinc,taking the workout videos of mongolian groom down is  admitting someone fucked up and the system doesn't work..i have some dear friends who work at xbtv and i know they are not in charge of things like that but whoever is needs a pink slip... maybe we  daily fantasy sports  love our horses enough
dinkinc,i won $1100 yesterday and feel like i took two years off of my life... i have to eliminate something and i think  it is  got to be college football...too hard to disern my advantages in a twelve game season..too hard to monitor my open bets.. too hard to get down at peak numbers
dinkinc,trump said if you get health insurance when you are young it will increase in value as you get older.... he confused it with life insurance.....  he is a moron and he listens to no one... he is a fake person who just wants money and power and his followers are low iq racists
RASPicks,clearly most players are not betting 1k/2k per game and/or  daily fantasy sports  have the outs enabling them to do so on the type of stuff we release but on the other hand there are lots of players who are able to get down 2k or more and get terrific value from the service.
RASPicks,that is  only true if you're a scammer and  daily fantasy sports  promote your long term record accurately and transparently if you do and would-be buyers can see how bad you are once you become bad you're not gonna make money for much longer and certainly wont scale the product at a high cost.
RASPicks,vast majority of 1/2 point (or more) moves off 3 and 7 are the result of sharp money these days. if you can properly identify such moves that are the result of square public money (if they still exist) you've got unusual skills or info or are playing at a super square out imo.
ClevTA,right thats fair. when this started i didnt know i was going to do weekly  thursday night football  write ups. i was only going to post contest picks. i mean i easily could just post  thursday night football  record separately in my  thursday night football  articles. i do separate out all my picks anyways
ClevTA,i just think that between some down numbers and u add his mileage and off the field issues its not a slam dunk. if pollard is another kamara which some have used as a comp jerry knows he doesnt have to pay. there is obv risk there by jerry is still a business man
CizzlingSports,the $3k subs have to survive 17 weeks. no early payout provision in terms. and terms admit that if jambos is more than -23.33u subs will lose money even if $10k is paid out. imagine getting your teeth kicked in by nfl wk2  still 'ing for 15 more wks just to get above -23.33u
spanky,i went to a miss america pageant in ac many years back. these pageant women live and breath this shit. i can only imagine miss world.  people all over twitter saying we all need a miss nigeria in our lives. no thanks.  id rather have someone tell me fu than pretend they love me.
spanky,nj books lost on the superbowl.  every nj shop was heavy on the pats yet no one ever went to 3.  even 3 dog money would have attracted some rams action. oh wait nj is scarce on real bookmakers and guys in europe who know nothing about us bookmaking are controlling the lines. sad
spanky,johnny the ceo of  called me earlier. real nice guy. invited me to play. first 2 bets st joes undernext bet sas ov tried 2500 after 81 second delay got 1k. last bet rams +3.5 tried 2k after 39 sec delay got 1k.delays need to go away and 1k max nfl side is ridiculous
PlusEVAnalytics,if there are multiple teams offering kd a max deal you are by definition getting him below his true market value if you can sign him to one. also youre a terrible team in a huge market with a reputation for incompetence and you have no plan b. so maybe dont get too cute?
aluckyaday,so i guess the wisdom of the crowd is scalping. the issue for the book is it becomes much easier to do online. all you have to do is react quicker to pinney line movements than the books. 2 solutions tie your lines to pinney and try and move quicker than the automated scalpers..
aluckyaday,if you can bet to -105 in a regulated market and beat pinney fine. but that is a lot harder than switching to a soft book model. online is very different to bm. if you  daily fantasy sports  restrict online you are exposed to spanky bots and arbers hovering up any mistakes you make.
aluckyaday,"""actually deliverable"". you can not leave the eu without having a border with it. so to me there are only 3 options. leave with a border on the island of ireland ripping up the good friday agreement leave with a border in the irish sea ripping up the union or stay in the eu."
aluckyaday,i would think it will be still worse than vegas. guessing there will be an anti arbing clause hidden deep in their tcs. if you take any prices that are out of line with the market they will say you are an arber and restrict. lots of good publicity but not really giving much...

joeytunes2,there's been stuff going on for years like this. when i was young i remember me and my friend both being on betus at the same time and i was on a different line set. him being squarish me being sharper. jazz also is notorious for these practices offshore. even though i like them.
EdMillerPoker,this is a huge one. its why if you want to get the most out of in-play betting you have to reverse engineer the feed to some extent at least because you have to know not just whats a good bet now but what bets youre likely to be able to get later also.
EdMillerPoker,this is a complicated topic but the answer isn't that we just plant a flag pregame and stick to it all game long. depends a lot on what book you're using and how they are making lines but in general  it is  much more likely that they're the ones flag planting than we are...
LeeSharpeNFL,"khalil mack is not great when double teamed and as a result gets double teamed a lot.

attracting two blockers has value to give others chances but this seems like a good explanation for why mack has been less of a threat.

still  daily fantasy sports  have a 1st round pick this year though."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my unpopular take is you should take a qb in the 1st or 2nd round every draft.

maybe an exception if you have a known elite qb already on an expensive contract (like sea).

but a good player at any other position can't change your franchise. only a good qb can. qb is everything."
LeeSharpeNFL,"how is there serious discussion about whether cousins - who's had a great year just sadly not vs. packers - should return...

... but for trubisky  it is  just like ""well we're stuck with him who else are you going to get really?"" he's had a handful of good games but is quite bad."
LeeSharpeNFL,"you can get it from nflscrapr! the wp was about 10 percent  prior to the snap.

can't easily access quickly the hypothetical wp but kicking a field goal there would be awful. they are down 7 with only 1:12 left in the game and 1 timeout. they likely never get an offensive snap again."
AndyMSFW,the shading is to just all-together keep you from betting a wong teaser. below you can see the middle book prices the giants at a pk rather than +2 taking it out of the zone where the teaser is optimal.  not only that but you're paying the same price to essentially move 4 pts.
DannyParkins,i appreciate your opinion and listening to the show/podcast just telling you it comes from a genuine place. i was very high on mitch coming into the season and still think he has a chance to work out and be good... its just been a terrible start to what should be a big year.
DannyParkins,any other bulls fans curious what jim boylen thinks about the nba and china? hes the coach of a team that is a global brand his players have shoe deals and its the leagues biggest story. i wanna know what he thinks and see how he handles questions that go beyond xs and os.
DannyParkins,the bears were gassed but aaron rodgers had a hof 2nd half there was no way mack wasn't gonna be gassed who missed all of training camp and kyle fuller dropped a game winning int. bears had fewest players miss games due to injury last year and won 12 games ill take a repeat.
Gingfacekillah,as for model inputs i  daily fantasy sports  give those out. the hard work in any sport is finding predictive and determinative relationships in the data. my advice is to try as many things as you can think of. be creative approach the problem with a scientific curiosity and  daily fantasy sports  give up.
logan_matthews9,"not just the format but the field is pretty meh too. fowler makes his season debut and a handful of big names join up for the first time in 2020 (phil finau molinari).

logan_matthews9,nate lashely t10 at +600 is one i like but want to see the non-dead heat line. have him at 28.3 percent . bet against him against mcdowell who i also like here +450 vs 30.6 percent . bunch of guys i like who i already have matchup money on - wolff casey mcd
logan_matthews9,and its not just getting better lines its avoiding bad ones. one that comes to mind is the memphis/houston game. i got it at under 205 when it first posted. the next morning you took it over 202 (i think). maybe if you had the choice at 205 you wouldnt have taken that bet?
PikachuBets,actually even then the whole us women are paid so much less than us men argument is still a fallacy. they are two teams in entirely diff markets. its not how revenue works. best team in the world vs one of the worst. us womens is the top paid womens team in the world
PikachuBets,im trying my hardest. i cap during wee hours of the night after my busy day job while my cat runs all over the keyboard messing up my formulas. i watch every game on dvr at 0.5x speed in order to catch every little derailed nuance. the picks are fire; they are not sarcastic
PikachuBets,aaaaaaand hello welcome to exhibit a re: the major problem with claiming best of luck openers. it makes ppl think the market moved from -307 to -360. no. best of luck opener was -307 bm/pinny opened -340/-345. the market didn't move 53 cents. market was just far better than best of luck soft open.
adamchernoff,case can be made that it is a worse injury situation for wsh with three starters and four of top five db's potentially out guice on ir midweek haskins dealing with a lingering ankle issue and mclaurin not 100 percent  with the hamstring. enormous step up in run d for wsh too vs phi.
adamchernoff,as someone with a passion for betting and radio i have a ton of respect for everyone out there that produces a show. there are many others i have missed (was not intentional) but these guys and shows above are ones i sub to  listen every week. i recommend all to do the same.
adamchernoff,state (game +/- 7 points) arizona gained just 107 yards of their 357 total (29.9 percent ). of the 204 passing yards for the cardinals 88 came on one single play - which also put the score inside the range to cover late in the game. putting game state aside and focusing on the...
adamchernoff,with reverse line movement comes the idea of siding with the sharps. what makes a sharp? who are the sharps? did the person that dumped an account on lac on monday morning taking the line from +2 to -1 at low limits a sharp because he moved the line? were the people that bet..
adamchernoff,it in turn does a very similar thing. for me it feels like an easy way to piece together a bunch of small simple thoughts into a big picture to get a giant thought about the entire league as a whole. another benefit i have found is that adjustments from week to week are...
adamchernoff,as much as it pains me as a jets fan this ab move by ne is incredible. one of the greatest low risk/high upside deals - ever. patriots management are not walk over doormats like the folks in oakland. how on earth can many of these nfl journalists see this as a bad move!?
adamchernoff,a few family members went to the grey cup in '09 at mcmahon when the riders won and still complain that their ass is cold ten years later. you couldn't pay a lot of people $112 to sit out there and watch part time car salesman qb's battle it out for the canadian title.
adamchernoff,down to two or three spots. but i was tired of wasting all of the effort on the other 13-14 games i did not bet. handicapping into buckets was a method i started to use so i could understand *who* was betting on *what* each week and *why*. by knowing those three i could...
adamchernoff,"small range of numbers 0-14 points used for the spread in 240 of the 256 games per year. instead of coming up with a point spread or making a bet because the price ""looks right/wrong"" try build a method that allows you to price games to 100 and create a spread off of that."
ToddFuhrman,"the hardest thing to explain to people is power ratings aren't based off wins and losses...

what i mean is  it is  possible for a team to lose and see their power profile improve while a team can win and see their power number decline.   daily fantasy sports  fall in love with scoreboard watching"
TheCousinSal,all in all im going to go ahead and call that a bad first half for the saints. up 13-0 and now the rams have momentum  the ball in the second half.  also - for some reason no cant run the ball. disgusting. ok - i pray to jesus this reverse-jinx has some affect.
12Xpert,i think the ifs have been very balanced in their position in the two main party manifestos. on labour they have said their are saying  it is  wrong to imply only the rich will have to pay. on the conservatives they have said it is wrong to imply no one will have to pay.
12Xpert,"yeah i would too. 
the tipsters' book is basically a grind for two-thirds of it 250 stories of tipsters who are now almost all gone. you wouldn't have to read all of them just a few to get a flavour. the reason i put them all in was to avoid giving a biased view."
12Xpert,but here's the problem. i collect a load of tipsters who say they are sharp. we study them and they end up with a mean of 0 percent . i say so much for being sharp they are just more coin tossers. and you say they obvious weren't sharp so your results are void.
mschwimer,no. we can 100 percent  profit from gambling on our own. this is purely a business decision. taking less short term money early to make big long term returns later. in a vacuum sub service or betting. betting 100 percent  more profitable. but sub service is step 1 on a very long term play.
mschwimer,to drastically over simplify. mlb owners are faced with the decision. do i make $200m in profit and have x percent  chance to win ws or do i make a $150m profit and have 2x percent  chance to win the ws. recently most owners have been choosing option 1. fans should hold owners accountable.

RufusPeabody,"some books: ""if game is cancelled or suspended winner is determined by the score after the last full inning (unless home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning in which case the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called)."""
RufusPeabody,i've gotten shit for making absolute statements before. not every tout goes about it this way. i much more respect a tout that has been losing but doesn't falsify their record. there are one or two that have won long-term but you're not going to get me to shill for a tout ever.
RufusPeabody,so you give out a pick against a number (9) that might exist in the future and if it does then you're picking against that number? but if the line were to drop to 8 you'd get to keep the pick against 8.5? and you  daily fantasy sports  see the issue with this?
RufusPeabody,sorry if i'm being too general for your taste. can understand why you take issue with it. but exceptions in this industry are few  far between and bettors make the mistake of paying for negative expected value picks from a losing tout faaaar more often than passing on a pick-seller who has value.
RufusPeabody,if we assume probability of converting 2-pt try is 48 percent  ordinarily you're better off waiting until after the third  touchdown  if and only if your probability of converting on that last try is 64 percent .  daily fantasy sports  think waiting magically increases 2-pt chance from 48 percent  to 64 percent .
SportsCheetah,"at the very least this can be used to your advantage betting in-game. i'm going to put together a ""cheat sheet"" of sorts with nuggets on every team that based on the data we have a quarter of the season in are causal: player/rotation extremes that fly under the radar a la jp."
SportsCheetah,while simultaneously injuring their two best weapons on same play (diggs now back). either way one of these teams is 60 points better than the other on the season the other is 9-2. wilson is a god but sea generally gets hit with the run good. also this is a blair walsh burner.
capjack2000,"lets wait and see the full terms of the dk/sbt acquisition before we bury kambi. it may be a long time before anything changes in terms of software or risk management at dk. 

sbt software is one of the worst on the market so i dont consider this good for anyone (except sbt)."
capjack2000,the game is in a paradigm shift due to the ball. anyone who bets via quantitative analytics has had trouble adjusting to the way the game has gone this year. 2017 is a decent prior but not really close. if you're disheartened focus on football.  daily fantasy sports  force it. always next year.
capjack2000,"he's not recommending to bet whatever he'd like with impunity. he's saying  daily fantasy sports  pretend to be the big operator in the market and then take grocery dollars on an nfl bet. 

made my first wager at dk since jan yesterday. they'd only take $65 on an nfl total  +$50 on review."
capjack2000,the new unlimited player live bj at some nj shops is a real peach. the casino decides which hands you split and you decide if you want to play 1 or 2 hands. that 66 v t turns into t6 v t and you decide if you want to double down on it.
capjack2000,"sends a message to the rest of the team.  it is  not all the goalie's fault but make him the example so that the other guys won't let him down again. 

nhl coach mike keenan once had twins rich  ron sutter on his team. when one wasn't playing well he'd bench the other."
capjack2000,we  daily fantasy sports  know the rev share deals that these casinos make with operators but so far  it is  all the big boys. they'll price control the market so that they still get high margins to cover the 36 percent  tax. the barrier to entry keeps out small operators. the consumer suffers.
capjack2000,"if i was cmo for a sportsbook i'd get a team of interns to visit bars (with their permission) in nj border towns to sign up and educate patrons. hopefully from out of state. bars win. books win. bettors win.

much more efficient than appearing at sloan to a room full of sharps."
dinkinc,pass interference is reviewable but it has to be blatent.....make that very blatent so  daily fantasy sports  challenge it if  it is  just common pass interference which we might call at any time ... take the review away... you made it into a joke..plus there are far too many things you cant review
RASPicks,"with our ""set up  go"" release system you get 45 seconds with play in hand to set up your bets. all you then have to do is submit the final confirmation to beat the line move. here is a simulation of what monday's release of 253 indianapolis +1 (now -2.5 -115) looked like:"
RASPicks,never understood that theory. even at our peak volume ras total plays accounted for a fraction of the big line moves on a given  college basketball  week. kenpom had a much larger influence on the evolution of the market. anyhow who says  it is  ruined? we even got totals on extras last season!
RASPicks,"you're absolutely correct about it being an issue but i think the bigger story for many ""average joe's"" is that pros/syndicates buy services.  that is something you  daily fantasy sports  hear talked about.  as an bettor let me figure out how to get down and if it is worth my time and effort."
ClevTA,brendan can easily recite all the gto of poker and can read ppl etc but thinks a team that doesnt have to travel and plays in its home arena all season is somehow negatively effected by playing in that same arena in the playoffs. i want to see the same level of analysis
ClevTA,two separate tourneys conducted in the same 10 day window. each is single elimination but a bad team has virtually no chance to win one or more gms if they had to play the best teams so its a more way to balance it and give everyone a shot to run these gms
ClevTA,not only did u waste the pick u traded u wasted the actual pick on callaway so its 2 wasted picks. u also kept higgins off the field bc u traded up for him and felt the obligation to play him. the guy ran wrong routes and didnt know plays. its a disaster
ClevTA,most stunning and disappointing part about bakers season is lack of accuracy even when he has a clean pocket. was 27th in comp percent   p rating coming into yesterday then went 17-29 (58 percent ) 185 yds (6.4 ypa) 1  touchdown  2 int with no pressure yesterday according to pff. thats just bad
ClevTA,jacobs will get all the carries but gameflow will matter a lot since oak should be behind a ton. there could be gms where he only gets 8-9 due to gameflow. i love sanders bc i think philly wins 11-12 gms his backups arent good  i always like rb on a great tm

spanky,if i walk into  and decide to bet a game for the amount on their limit sheet then 100 percent  of the time i will get the bet.  they may have the legal right to deny the bet but they won't.  why?  because they're an honorable american bookmaker not a bullshit european dressmaker.
spanky,the verdict isnt out on   they are only taking $500 on cf.  they still have me on a delay. the other day there was a technical glitch where i waited 30 minutes for bet approval! the only positive is -105 on nfl sundays 10k. if i ever get any bet denied im out.
spanky,there are countless times i would bet a number solely because i knew my bookmaker needed the bet.  i would earn 0 or slightly lose to the piece. recognizing that you need the bookie way more than he needs you is a mental hurdle one must leap to get to the next level.
spanky,"an indicator of a 2nd tier nervous bookmaker is when he tells me ""you can not bet both sides of the same game."" a number is hung to write bets. what is the difference if i bet the other side or john smith bets it?  is his cash any greener than mine?!?  #beabookmakernotadressmaker"
spanky,ryan saiful hal and the rest of the supervisors at  treated me great. hal picked up my rooms and bought me dinner. i even had a reserved sign on one teller just for me so i can get down quickly.  everything was great for the last month up until i won on saturday
spanky,unfortunately i dont intend to be locked in a room with any guy . fact is nick and co. have refused to book myself and 1000s of others. if and when they ever decide to take off the dress and leave the dressmaking business and enter the bookmaking business - ill be waiting.
PlusEVAnalytics,biggest surprise for me was how often a high-clv stale line play was ignored by the contest population. not sure whether game theory or ignorance guessing the latter. i am projecting that this contest can be played with +2k to 3k in positive expected value with good strategy. ill be back in 2020.
aluckyaday,they are not scared. they are running a business plan that maximises their profits. it is their choice. if you can beard back in then go for it. it is all part of the game. but ultimately the soft book model will maximise their profits. it is modern bookmaking it is the future!
aluckyaday,basically lay the bet off at close so you have an equal win or loss on both outcomes. the profit or loss is how much closing line value you got. calculate the roi from the total stakes on both bets and the sum of the clvs. calculate the standard deviation of the clvs.
aluckyaday,that would only be the case if the system accepted the bet which i think is not the case. sounds like it was not entered or not entered correctly. but if it was yes they need to  check for other wrongly accepted bet any punters who won would need to return their winnings
aluckyaday,american just  daily fantasy sports  get the beautiful game not saying the sports you bet on will change but what you bet on will.  as a recreational punter would you rather have a few ways to bet on a game or thousands? money back offers and free bets? free to play picks contests?
aluckyaday,public pressure? the vast majority of the public will not have a problem. the only people that see the glass ceiling are recreational sharps who can beat a recreational book but not a sharp one. its not a glass ceiling at all they are just not good enough to play with the pros!
aluckyaday,"in the mps code of conduct it says ""members have a general duty to act in the interests of the nation as a whole"". i guess it depends on how you interpret that. because the public voted for something in a referendum is it in the interests of the nation as a whole?"
aluckyaday,if he is making money by beating closing line value then there can be a justification to sell picks. he will have already bet before tipping and selling picks allows him to reduce his volatility. if he is not beating closing line value then either he has been lucky or is very stupid!
aluckyaday,art 50 is a complete stitch up the government has given in completely to the eu. a customs union would complete the capitulation. but they had no choice. the uk hand is so weak no deal would be compete disaster. uk needs eu trade eu countries do not need uk trade bluff called!

nonrandomalpha,im not a huge fan of nfl probability charts; they do not represent reality. if these probability odds were pricing options black swan events apparently happen on a regular basis - which in fact is not the case. too many games approach 95-99 percent  but do not win 95-99 percent  of the time.
nonrandomalpha,if the #dolphins gm  isn't interested in winning in '19 that doesn't extrapolate to the coach or players. you + most critics are assuming this is '17 browns bad - and  that is  egregiously wrong. if they start fitz over rosen in wk 1 the u4.5 wins is even more seriously in doubt.
nonrandomalpha,bears are young enough to still use '19 as a stepping stone but it has to come with visible progress - like winning a playoff game for the first time in my adult life and less consistent inconsistency (you like that?) from no. 10. if those 2 things materialize in '19 i'm content.
nonrandomalpha,the latter quarter of the season the saints looked like a shadow of their earlier season selves. looked slow old + confused v dallas were getting blown out by tb before bucs mel touchdown own could only score 12 v car squeaked by pit who then struggled at home to even beat cincy.
LeeSharpeNFL,"a year ago i posted this to facebook:

 i've made a lot mistakes in my life but it helps to remember that at least i've never kicked a field goal down 4 with 4:30 left in the game. 

no idea which coach it is referring to. it could have been any of them."
LeeSharpeNFL,"cpoe is easier to explain than expected points added so i think it has a much higher chance of taking off outside of the analytics community.

you  daily fantasy sports  have to have a math background to understand ""how likely is a pass to be caught based on the length of the pass""."
LeeSharpeNFL,"not even sure  it is  possible for football to be played on spreadsheets. hard to get the papers to stay in place with people running on top of them.

plus you'd have a computer with a lot of memory to have that many rows and columns all open at once. seems incredibly unrealistic."
LeeSharpeNFL,"if he'd drafted mahomes or watson instead his plan would be seen as very good. he went all in on a rookie qb -- a good strategy -- and just picked the wrong one.

i think many tactics were bad including the mack trade  trading up when drafting trubisky). but strategy was good."

LockyLockerson,lastly and this is the one everyone gets wrong...winning the mvp is the apex of a career arc.   it is  not a spike that comes out of nowhere with very rare exceptions (nash and derrick rose basically and  that is  it in 50 years). it doesn't just happen at 21/22 or year 1/2/3.
LockyLockerson,"i  daily fantasy sports  really know why i just did that ""the more you know"" series of tweets that may not even help. i've just read a lot of bullshit preview stuff being re-tweeted into my timeline the last few days.  you're better off just betting your gut honestly.  that stuff ain't helping."

last year was the first year since 2010 where the median mov was negative"
DannyParkins,feel good? no. but i wouldnt fire him. because then you have no continuity and a new gm would want a new coach and round and round the cycle goes. this team is largely gonna be the same next year given picks and cap space. id see it through another year with pace/nagy.
DannyParkins,did you read the police report in 2014 that detailed the physical injuries on crystal espinal? did you hear tyreek go silent on the tape when she asked how she got the bruises? yes people plead guilty to things they didnt do all the time but again you think hes 100 percent  innocent?
Gingfacekillah,in case there was any confusion from the article in step 1 you are asking solver to adjust the xgoals [f5] so that the poisson  percent  [e6] is the same as the no-vig implied over  percent  [e5]. when you click solve the implied goal total will be in cell f5. hope this helps.
logan_matthews9,-7 gd xgd even worse. lucky to make playoffs and were only in the picture because turner had 1 the best gk seasons ever. unlikely to repeat that and lost 106 starts from last year. have to be high on buksa camara and sinovic (whos only good with besler) to think theyre better
logan_matthews9,can only get $25 on it but castro o3.5 -120 tonight is easy. bernie is the front runner and this is probably the biggest piece of ammunition his opponents have been given. like bloomberg and stop and frisk: if theres a weakness theyll bring it up a lot (9x for sf last time)

PikachuBets,because the purpose of the ncaa is not to prepare players for the nba. not at all. 1 percent  of college goes to nba. to say that a team isnt any good bc their players havent done anything in the nba is a bad take. thats not what college ball was designed for
adamchernoff,i could and that would the number i would need to see to not look at taking cin next sunday. it is not pretty basing a handicap around a defensive front or a qb that has averaged 4.8 and 4.6 intended air yards the last two weeks suddenly attacking a very vulnerable secondary.
adamchernoff,few people will discuss anything matchup related (95 percent  of plays during the game) but god forbid a coach decides not to go for two in the 3rd quarter everyone will beat the topic to death for hours. i just think bettors waste so much time on the wrong thing  basics are neglected.
Ccon8181,not to mention they were down 3 right before half with ball in  field goal  range going for  touchdown . throws a pick returned to own 25. buccs score  touchdown . so instead of going on to half tied they go in down 10. brutal swing. plus defense made jamis look like brady.
Ccon8181,after a solid finish to 2017 and start to 2018 i was humbled by # college basketball  and #nba from march madness until the end of the basketball season. never forced action or chased. took my l and had to sit on my hands over the summer. ready to get back to work.

12Xpert,it is  a mix of both positions. in an ideal world a bookmaker would want equal action to keep things simple. but bettors are biased so  daily fantasy sports  facilitate bookmakers' wishes all the time. hence a bookmaker also has to know how to price a line to ensure he's not facing -ev.
12Xpert,if a paper doesn't agree with his politics a free press is allowed to criticise them. if more papers than not  daily fantasy sports  agree with his politics  that is  not a reason to invent a conspiracy and claim foul play. the same press existed between 1997 and 2008. blair did just fine.
12Xpert,sadly  it is  going to be difficult for liverpool to overhaul the record of 102 since the first 5 games in the current 38-game stretch were all 3-pointers. they would need to win the next 6 in a row to ensure their loss to man city on 3rd jan 2019 drops out. unlikely.
12Xpert,"just to cut off arguments that this is a useless methodology that can only be used at soft books who will ban you i have been completely up front that it only works at soft books and that to sustain it you will need to find ""ways"" to sustain your soft book accounts."

mschwimer,exactly! books make money by evening out the line. jim murren (ceo of mgm) is a good friend of mine and we talked about this in person. no book has quants that determine where a line should be. only where a line is to get equal action. they all want to mitigate risk
RufusPeabody,makes it seem really easy to win betting parlay. bad bankroll management. etc.  it is  like stories on lottery winners in a way except  it is  less obvious to people that this is luck. i wish there would be more stories on guys losing big bets.  daily fantasy sports  encourage problem gambling!
RufusPeabody,why does closing line value matter? the price discovery process. it indicates that other people who influence the market are on the same side. it matters bc no model (or intuition) is perfect. the best bettors are humble enough to know that their opinion isn't the only one that can have value.
RufusPeabody,the best prediction is some combination of the market and your prediction if youre beating the market. it could be 80 percent  weight on market price and 20 percent  on your model price. youre beating the market but your price isnt better than the market price; it just adds something to it
RufusPeabody,i guess my point is just that my financial interest in the industry has always been that i'm a bettor. insofar as prices are rarely dictated by square action touts  daily fantasy sports  make the betting markets any more inefficient. so i  daily fantasy sports  think touts are affecting my bottom line.
RufusPeabody,you're right. i've turned down a seven figures (and more than i presently make) to sell picks because it goes against the very fabric of who i am. if i was down to my last dollar would i sell picks? i'd like to think not but those are oftentimes the people selling.
SportsCheetah,interesting thought/open discussion: sunday pit closed ~+4.25 vs lar. 14 secs into the game pit snapped it over rudolph's head and it resulted in a fumble/ touchdown  for lar. the rams were up 7-0 with 14:46 remaining in the 1q (and get ball 2h). what's a fair in-game line at that point?
SportsCheetah,"and more talking than posting is just nonsensical. i literally post a position on every  college football  side every fri night for people to use as a guide 
its fun for bob to piggyback a 1-4 week from 7 weeks back from an article (those ones 28-20 on year) but come on"
capjack2000,"hey you got a better deal. run with it. 

 for what  it is  worth  if i ran a book 20 percent  is the number i'd choose. revealed in the dk/sbt numbers today is that 22 percent  of gross revenue is ""spent"" on promo bets for customers. so 20 percent  ratio seems fair."
capjack2000,"ok first bit of faulty reasoning shows early in the 2q. in discussing that the 1h line was 109 but the game total was 210.5 they conclude  that is  because scrubs will be used late in the game which will mean less scoring in the 2h. 

 that is  not how it works."
capjack2000,"that time is already here. there are 11 physical sportsbooks; 6 use the same lines.  there are 6 online sportsbooks; 4 use the same lines. 5 sets of lines in pa 2 aren't online. 

pa's fees have created a barrier to entry that is restricting your ability to find the best price."
capjack2000,delaware sports lottery is a good example of a high hold product (38 percent  avg) that the public consumed without satiation. they did so with an average bet of $5. the public stuck to the parlay lottery even after single game betting came to de. however it is showing signs of eroding.
capjack2000,for the most part they have a low barrier to entry as well. $45k license fee 7.5 percent  tax rate. need to be tethered to an existing casino (19 of them). that can make it tougher for a true startup to get in the game. in-person registration is a downer for ia.
capjack2000,"some notes:
- i like the format of putting the interview ahead of the conversation.
- re nj: ymmv on cc acceptance while it could be a bad thing its also a good thing. plenty of options for depositing beyond cash.
- the dk policy is clearly kyc/aml. not for profiling purposes."
dinkinc,first does the trend have any valu...there was a season many years ago where sacremento won 15 consecutive games on wednesday and it became a big deal.. that was just nonsense and has to be dismissed.. a trend like utah scores more points in the second half than the first may 1/2
dinkinc,i  daily fantasy sports  believe that is the case at all...he is transparent at what he does... there are so many stiffs and so many people who represent themselves as experts and extract money from the uninformed.. i know he makes my job harder but  that is  because he is really good
dinkinc,if you have the right type of. business you can and should take his stuff.  someone is gonna get your weaker numbers but you need to book as many sharps as possible or none at all. i see both sides in todays markets. no point in having 200 squares and one spanky
robpizzola,there are no poor kids in the area that i live in (i hate to type that but it provides context). even if there were you can still have a $5 creative costume. youre acting like im dropping a grenade in these kids bags. im not ruining their halloween; theyre getting candy.
robpizzola,"yesterday you were going on about how judging plays by closing line value is the wrong way to calculate a true edge but the first paragraph of this says ""the opening line is much easier to beat than lines throughout the day and closing line"" which is a direct contradiction to that."
RASPicks,i recently met someone who said hearing me on a podcast years ago 'inspired' him to give sports betting a serious shot. he is now competing in the same markets we do and is betting earlier. there's opportunity cost involved in any info you give out in any form free or paid.
ProfessorShine,youre correct.  i realized when i sent it the number doesnt work out.  the spirit of my idea is 2 byes and more teams.  the goal is to make the moderate bowls important.  not sure anyone wants to see another bowl game cancelled mid-game for lightning and no one bats an eye.
ClevTA,minnesota (stefanski) has utilized playaction at the 3rd highest percentage of total drop backs in the nfl. baker was terrible this year but was really good using pa. his comp percent  diff btw pa  non pa was highest in the nfl at 10 percent   a yds/att diff thats 3rd highest. great fit
ClevTA,kicking was a bad idea bc it easily could get blocked or when u miss u lose those extra 7 yards bc of the  field goal . if u dont get it on 4th down if u go for it then jax doesnt even have time to throw a quick a pass
ClevTA,new england has now faced the three worst offenses based on dvoa 5 of the 8 worst and 6 of the 11 worst offenses in the nfl. best offense theyve faced the giants was off a short week with no weapons. there has to be some value fading ne after their bye
ClevTA,den has 0 total sacks are missing their #2 cb in callahan and are 26th in dvoa pass d. minnesota is a good not great d on the road. they are bottom 5 in completion  percent  allowed. these are not good excuses. if gb o doesnt succeed tonight its a major problem
spanky,"""this show is brought to you by  who deals a spread wide enough it can be compared to armed robbery.  but enter your promo code to get a free $50 bet""  

if you are a network focused on helping others its either they change or you cut ties.  no in between imo."
spanky,my idea for a live show would be to have a split odds screen and face of either a pro bettor or a bookmaker talking while they work and giving insight as to what is happening. would be boring as hell for most but i think it would be fascinating for some.
spanky,who the hell are you?  what have you dominated? ive bet more this morning than youll bet in your entire lifetime. you write articles and give your opinions but like most people in twitter land you know nothing about what it takes to make a living as a pro bettor.  step aside.
spanky,"before mlb made all games start at the same time on last day we utilized if bets and parlays.

for example if million played hours before stl we would have played a reverse or parlayed col chc.
col beating million would cause stl to tank and save everyone for the playoffs #goodoldays"
spanky,ive known  for years and didnt even know it. he booked me out of costa rica when i was coming up. i finally got to meet him face to face at  live event. hes not only super nice but hes sharp as a tack. hed be a valuable asset to any joint.
spanky,great question. a line would auto move after player q bet say from -5 to -5-120.  the bookmaker would be the one to set the 10 cent move based on player qs profile. the bookmaker can then manually decide to go to -5.5  -5.5-115 or -6.  while hes deciding he is protected.
spanky,"""your job as a bettor is just to find the flaws. their job [bookmakers] is to make sure there arent any flaws in the first place. you can imagine which job is (much) easier"" 
we pay for this via the vig so we should all appreciate this advantage we have over sportsbooks."
spanky,pay  his money and  daily fantasy sports  even wait for a ruling from gaming.  going forward put a sign up at every teller window and a big banner of your max odds.  you bullshit the public on your treatment of winning sports bettors and now you try and rob the horse bettors.
spanky,i agree that hes morally wrong.  however being able to sell sand on a beach is something very few people can do successfully.  the ones that are to blame are the idiots buying into him. if you believe in a 50-0 record then paying a stupid tax is sometimes necessary for growth.
PlusEVAnalytics,no and youd better hope im not the next guy you run up on with your $75000 check for your mothers mercedes. you are a solution to a problem that doesnt exist and the way you engage with potential customers is top of the heap in an industry already filled with scumbags.
PlusEVAnalytics,"kelly is scummy in that she has zero useful expertise in the field in which she claims to be an expert.(shes also said some terrible things to my friends in #gamblingtwitter but i wont get into that here)
maybe scummy isnt the best word for todd but his story is so sadcommon"
aluckyaday,to me personally it makes no difference if the uk leaves or remains. i'm a legal eu resident and will still have the privileges that brings. so its not really a case of me accepting it. i will think it is a bad idea for the to leave until hindsight proves otherwise
aluckyaday,in reality they would not be putting him in no. 10. i would think the national unity government would just be put in place to ask the eu for an extension to allow for a general election. after which the temporary pm would stand down to allow the election to take place.
aluckyaday,the referendum was advisory. we looked at your advise and decided not to take it because it is not in the best interests of the country. if you are not happy with that then you do not have to re-elect us to represent you that is a true representative democracy in action.
aluckyaday,i think 365 would disagree! 25 percent  growth year on year in an established market is not too bad. time will tell what happens in the states maybe a different model will emerge over time but in europe allowing sharps to bet and balancing books has been shown to be sub optimal.
joeytunes2,being a pro bettor takes capital and time. it is impossible to have a full time job and watch the market or enter data into your model.whatever your handicap process is. those who tell you there pros and theres alot out there on twitter. be careful who u put your faith in.
EdMillerPoker,"feel like this is a common flaw. as gamblers we are told to focus on the long run and rightfully so.

but the reason you can be successful gambling is because its not actually a long term thing at all. youre actually being right about a zillion small very short term things."
GolcondaFund,"you  daily fantasy sports  say?...
just not sure what was ever #sharp about an avg qb without top 2 wrs..laying  touchdown .. the thing about being #sharp is being able to point out likely future outcome not rely on past performance to handicap. but you do you take the chalk and prosper."
nonrandomalpha,that is  not what i was saying.  it is  society's reaction to the spread of the virus. you'd think we were dealing with an indiscriminate unstoppable flesh eating disease. but if we want to treat it like one we can surely wreck the economy and people's lives as if it actually was.
LeeSharpeNFL,"in the last game bears' drives were 4 punts then 3 touchdowns then 5 punts.

if  that is  not momentum i  daily fantasy sports  know what it is*. of course why did the momentum shift?! and twice?! still working on that theory.

(* - unless  it is  coincidence but like come on.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i took a somewhat different approach from ben's code in that i wanted to actually keep the completion probability in the plays data itself that way you  daily fantasy sports  have to remodel in the code all the time.

it will auto-add cp your first run-through if you're already using my code."
whale_capper,got no fewer than 30 messages from folks today after they got that email. half of them... can you believe this shit after how trash hes been and the other half does this guy have an edge should i buy his service? didnt ever expect to be here but so it goes
whale_capper,with four weeks to go teams like the suns bulls wiz and knicks truly threw in the towel jazz played a ton of those teams down the stretch and inflated their numbers... those same contests had they been held in nov/dec/jan  daily fantasy sports  see as much of a discrepancy statistically imo
AndyMSFW,"learning some painful lessons about the opening lines as well.  i put together my numbers for the week last night and highlighted my plays:

LockyLockerson,miami's odds to do basically everything have gone the opposite way since the book came out and  that is  surprising since  it is  miami and people usually like betting them.  of the teams who make sense for the playoff they have the best odds by a huge margin (50/1 to make cfp).
EliHershkovich,"110 percent . but you gotta put wiggins in there reags. dude has become a three-level scorer + he and morsell shut down howard.

turgeon has held teams back but first time he's had a senior point guard in cowan + they're loaded with depth and athleticism. marial back in b10 play."
DannyParkins,tyreek plead guilty in 14 to punching and strangling his pregnant girlfriend. in 16 he apologized for his behavior. his son had a broken arm and the da thinks a crime was committed. he told his fiance you should be terrified of me too bitch and some think hes 100 percent  innocent.
Gingfacekillah,it was just a rough estimate taking the s touchdown ev of the entire league and the mean rating into account. i think more accurate would be to track individual team ratings over time and apply s touchdown evs to each one. surely some teams have a smaller strength deviation than others.
Gingfacekillah,"have to use the tools you have available. i've downloaded r and am working on transferring my work into that platform. definitely maxed out the results i can get from excel although i do like the visual nature of the ""coding"". i think  that is  why i was so reluctant to switch."
logan_matthews9,i didnt explicitly make it about race - i made the comment about people who think lamar isnt good who came out of hiding when he had a bad game. i then stereotyped who that would be - weirdly here you are getting defensive over the white guy comment and defending tannehill
logan_matthews9,"a ton of variance in the outright market. dj has been hit down to +8/900 fowler at +1750 at bookmaker kuchar at +4800 now at bm +4000 elsewhere. same with wolff +6875/+5000. 

if i was looking fowler number is good still like kuch there and obviously a fan of wolff that high"
logan_matthews9,if you actually do win at 58 percent  or whatever books will absolutely adjust to the lines you give out as fast as you give them... so when none of your customers can get the lines you post and therefore lose the profitability of your models will you still give a refund?
logan_matthews9,quiet sunday with a couple games without lines with cp3 and russ status unclear. love the hawks +7.5 and the over. cleveland is not a great team and shouldnt be giving up those kind of points to anyone. bad defensive teams and atlanta has played at a blistering pace (2nd in nba)

adamchernoff,i have been betting on them consistently for much of the season including as recently as two weeks ago. i was just curious on how you were using results from games up to 19 years ago with donovan mcnabb duce staley michael vick and brent celek to project kc's outlook this year?
adamchernoff,it is  an unpopular take considering the visuals of what went on at the end but i would say that the randall full sprint blind headshot to johnson extending was a heck of a lot worse/dangerous than garrett swinging. not condoning either by any means but we are numb to the former.
adamchernoff,"if you are in the ""restaurant"" which has 2x2 seating you're either staring up the nostrils of the person in front of you or crowding around one side of the table. you're also blocked off from the main screens which have the feature games upfront. if you are in the ""vip"" area..."
adamchernoff,this i like to look back at how a team has made their opponents better or worse this season. i set up my paper with the defences in question and list out opponents and their yards per play/rush attempt for the entire season against all opponents. the second temp is taking the...
adamchernoff,the qb has been struggling today i think it is best that they come out establish the run and send a message. if they can punch them in the mouth early and set the tone it will really soften up the defenders and creates easy pitch and catch opportunities. impose some will.
adamchernoff,it is who he is and will likely always be. more to the loss than him but he was a big part. the fact the rams never went to tempo and thought they have the advantage snapping late in the clock was off. new england jumped :00 many times. thanks for listening.
Ccon8181,#atlvstb not going over 48.5 after scoring 38 in first half is almost as bad as michigan state/wake staying under. almost as badboth teams shut it down second half today. in msu game it was turnovers n missed chip shot  field goal  keeping it under.still tough beat for the jamis over crew
Ccon8181,to be fair ive deserved every bit of criticism. its been a bad run for the past month. if i was getting butt hurt from some randoms busting balls on twitter then whats the point of being on twitter. losing real money hurts having ppl on twitter shit talk not so much
Ccon8181,i try to knock down as many shops as i can before the line settles. so im going around in person and on apps. little time. posting for free but investors get my lines. working on a solution where ill release as soon as i hit so others can snag same lines.

ToddFuhrman,gents youre missing the point. i never said it was just a hockey city; every big city has fans of all sports but saying the raps have surpassed the leafs is insanity. its like saying the blackhawks cups runs meant more than the bulls and cubs in chicago was never the case
12Xpert,it seems counterintuitive i'd have though over a sample as small as 34 that it might matter. but it doesn't. i've seen this before regarding kelly staking and whether it matters if you know or  daily fantasy sports  know precisely your edge for every bets. it doesn't you just need the average.
12Xpert,"we evidently have different bayesian priors.
mine: your betting expectation is not 57 percent ; you're blinded by the law of small numbers.
yours: binomial can't apply because it fails to account for what you see if you have 57 percent .
come back in 5 years. we'll know who was right."
12Xpert,and if you want to talk about pyckio here's this year's performance from the pros. 1.4 percent  from 6241 tips january to september.  that is  pre fees and slippage. regardless  it is  whole lot less that their previous work. no idea which pros have come in and gone out in that time.
12Xpert,but those things  daily fantasy sports  happen because 1) most bettors are overconfident and will never believe the will never have +ev and 2) greed drives those with negative expected value to believe that touts claiming +ev are telling the truth when almost always  that is  not so. touts are equally blind.
12Xpert,to be fair  has been decent beyond other bookie ceos in reaching out to his customer base. but  it is  tinged with what he and his team did to his affiliate prog (there was no need for it). he will have done very nicely from the pokerstars buyout who probably drove it.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  believe  it is  that big.  that is  a figure  that is  crept into folklore and has no credible evidence to support it.  report that 4 percent  of their customers get restricted. but  it is  not particularly hard to get that accolade at a recreational book setting loss leaders.

mschwimer,i dont know why this is so hard to understand. the reason i am doing this is because the tout industry is the worst. transparacy and financial accountability are needed in the space. if i provide it the others will have to or they will fail. at least that is the hope.
mschwimer,"while that scenario is highly unlikely it is possible. here is who the system is for. 

1. people that think we are full of it and believe our system wont work. 
2. people that can afford to bet $300 per play over 1000+ plays. 

system not for believers who bet small amounts"
mschwimer,gotcha!  if our model says a football team should be -2.5 (+100) and the market line is a pickem (+100) we believe the actual edge percentage is 6.2 percent .  if the game closes at -1.5 then our edge over the closing line becomes 2.8 percent . that what you are asking?
mschwimer,my best guess on how  does by sport. our best sport will be nfl. 2nd best is ncaa football. 3rd best is ncaa basketball. 4th best will be nba. 5th best will be mlb. i also think there will not be a season in any sport where we dont beat the market.
RufusPeabody,let us  take a look at georgia's  college football  playoff chances (thread): the rest of their schedule is not easy -- florida auburn missouri and am remain and if they navigate those the sec title game vs. alabama or lsu. here are the various scenarios and their playoff hopes in each(1/x)
RufusPeabody,heres my point: what are the chances these guys would have gone back and asked for the ticket to be paid as straight bets had one of the two won? and what are chances ticket writer pays it? this law allows books to freeroll themselves on correlated parlays they book. unethical!
RufusPeabody,"best run: when i filled out my gfs picks for her fathers office weekly nfl pickem pool and she got first place both the first two weeks. 

worst run: her father found out and i couldnt help her anymore and had to send him my plays the rest of the season."
RufusPeabody,same issue with dk's sports betting national championship a year ago. some people had groups of entries which put ppl with a single entry at a disadvantage. how does this get addressed in the  daily fantasy sports /contest world going forward? i honestly  daily fantasy sports  know. so tough to enforce.
jeffma,i think the main issue here is your definition of sharp. i have heard you constantly claim that last season every sharp was on cleveland each week. this is not true. and in my mind supports the claim that you dont really know enough to speak to the success of sharps
SportsCheetah,"his scheduled ""first reevaluation"" is in february. they can easily say he needs 6-8 more weeks at that point and the season is about over there. and since their actual season is over it just wouldn't make sense to rush one of the league's biggest stars back (the league gets that)"
SportsCheetah,"i grew up in santa clarita and saugus was a neighboring high school. this stuff is always the absolute nut low but it hit home today. 

im not sure what the motives or reasons were today but its generally a good reminder either way that people need other people. be good."
SportsCheetah,nop o35.5 -110 - deep enough to deal with the zion injury for 6-8 weeks (especially if nicol melli is the next arvydas sabonis). zion wins roy anyway. jrue/lonzo is the best defensive backcourt in the nba. brandon ingram is good at basketball. josh hart 6th man. i'm a lakers fan
SportsCheetah,"if i had to take a position on each win total (shopped):

atl u34.5+110 - year or two away. their 29 wins were 5 above pythag exp. 3/5 best netrtg (dorseydedmon/lin) no longer on team. prince/baze were 9/10 among those that played regular mins. 24-win team to 35+ tough with youth."
capjack2000,"the home team listed on the bottom is a us thing. the rest of the world (outside na) puts the home team on the top. 

we have mlb to thank for this. 

i'm surprised these global companies aren't more in-tune with us sportsbetting culture when they enter (and also not surprised)."
capjack2000,in the black market there are hundreds (thousands) of books. if you got limited you moved on to a new account. in the legal market you are limited by what your state permits. in pa 40 percent  of the operators are kambi. in other states you may only have one operator.
capjack2000,"only if the wire act falls or a good legal team makes the case for the safe harbor provision of the wire act making exchanges between consenting states to be legal. 

even then a low-margin exchange site is going to have to license  compete with the big -110 boys. tough road."
capjack2000,"i'm not a fan of making picks though. if you're interested in sportsbetting you need to realize early on that there is no easy path here. 

learn the sport. learn the market. a pick can illustrate that but  it is  like a teacher giving answers to homework that may be incorrect."
capjack2000,"i believe kambi bonuses are use once. you get the winnings only.  it is  been a year since i played bonuses at kambi sites so  it is  possible they've changed but that screenshot looked familiar. 

you're right if they add the bonus to your cash from the start its different strategy."
capjack2000,dont confuse predatory and profitable. the us mortgage industry is a good example. all loans are sold via cdo. if you sell someone a loan for a reasonable affordable home you all profit. if you sell them a loan for a home they cant afford you are preying on their naivety.
capjack2000,"a key snippet in that egr story i linked earlier. kip levin (coo fanduel) stating that their departure from the european model is deliberate. 

my quote that followed was made before i was aware of that. however i think  it is  also a key component to the success of that approach."
capjack2000,"that is  unfortunate. while their tc have always stated that they reserve this right  it is  never a good thing to be viewed as taking something away. 

 it is  worth noting they make it clear the bettor is still welcome to bet everything else. most pros would gladly take that deal."
capjack2000,"- the odds boards are 42"" tv's suspended 15' in the air
- very little seating
- instead of a large video wall behind the bar they chose to use 16 tv's which can't be aggregated together
- very few printed odds sheets
- 2 kiosks to browse odds not bet."
dinkinc,thats all i have seen on twitter.  if kendrick grounded into a 1-2-3 double play the nats fans would have screamed for a pinch hitter .cubs manager fired for the same reason roberts will get fired. seems everyone wants him and he missed the playoffs.. i hope roberts gets a gig
robpizzola,"someone needs to explain to me why i can't type in this grey ""what's happening?"" box. this is some of the dumbest ui i have ever seen in my life. $4-billion+ company net worth and i gotta click a box to open another box so that i can send a tweet."
VegasRefund,"pats/ravens down to 3.. after opening at 4.5. anyone taking ravens at +3 or less need some help. 

doubt it goes to 2.5. but if it does it wont last for long. books would be putting themselves in a pretty bad spot in getting middled. even though they probably already are."
suuma810,"example # 10001 on why long term getting the best of the number is so crucial.

i took bills 6.5 earlier this week but had market resistance. before kickoff bills moved to +7 -110ish at pinnacle.

i didnt lose because i didnt buy half a point i didnt beat the market."
suuma810,"#nfl betting tip

general but: beat the fucking closing line. 

when your goal is to bet into inefficient lines you want to have an advantage over the more efficient line. more closing line value - more good bets  more wins = more profit. therefore its also a great indicator of success."
suuma810,he and pete carroll believe in establishing the run but  it is  establishing the pass in 2018. hawks average 7.4 ypa per pass on first down to 3.4 per run through two weeks. they gotta go more pass heavy on early downs to avoid long 3rd downs and implement more pa.
ClevTA,no reporter on the planet has been more accurate than glazer. obj never denied saying it all he said was hes here next year. one has zero to do with the other. either way my issue is with maniac fans tweeting at reporters threatening families kids and in general being inhumane
ClevTA,its in the article. but yes altitude in denver early in a season when opponents are not yet in full shape + sep heat matters a lot. teams arent used to it this early. those numbers arent pure coincidence. they have won outright both as favorites and underdogs in that span
ClevTA,nfl betting markets are most efficient markets in all of sports. spreads all translate into win probabilities and are definitely the benchmark u should be using. this really wasnt supposed to be a negative tweet  u do seem to be doing good work so hope u dont take it that way
CizzlingSports,"missing the point - there are going to be trials where bm/cris is in fact wa at release and others where bm/cris is a one-off best available line like nd -17.5. if you're not always releasing wa you're not ""changing the game"" - just padding your records like any other tout."
spanky,i appreciate it. most people like me arent on social media.  i stayed out of the public eye for 18 years. only when these european bookmakers came into my home state of new jersey is when i decided to speak out and raise public awareness on how winning bettors are treated.
spanky,a common misconception is sharps get kicked out for winning.  ive been kicked out of joints after going 0-6.  why? cuz i beat the closing line on all 6 plays.  winning is a byproduct of beating the closing line.  forget the win loss record. show me a detailed closing line record
spanky,hanging an under on top of an over is one of many practices that are brought from overseas with no consideration for what an american sports bettor is used to. log into any offshore sportsbook and/or visit any lv sportsbook and start learning.  do you guys do any research at all?
spanky,my ultimate goal was and always will be making money while garnering the respect of every major offshore bookmaker that i am privileged to be a customer of.  this 7 month twitter ride has been fun as hell but i've been in this game since 1999-2000 working harder than most. (2/2)
spanky,if i told you what i bet then some twitter nerd will reverse engineer my plays threatening my livelihood.  i came on twitter to help change the path of sports betting in america. self promotion was a byproduct simply so my voice would hold weight.hope i'm not sounding like a jerk
spanky,this is an example of a banking machine kinda like a progressive video poker machine. the public plays the machine until its state is +ev.  so for a wild cherry pie someone spent hours baking it and i spent a few minutes putting 3 more cherries and eating the bonus yummy
PlusEVAnalytics,depends on what my model estimates as the variance of my estimator. is my modeled win prob 55 percent  +/- 2 percent  or 55 percent  +/- 10 percent ? im simplifying here because its non-normal irl but you get the point. then i calculate a posterior as f(prior estimate observed results)
PlusEVAnalytics,but if youre finding angles that the market hasnt found theres no reason why closing line value would catch up. and if im looking long term where the volatility is reduced id rather look at results (no assumptions needed) than closing line value (need to assume closing lines are efficient). (3/3)
PlusEVAnalytics,interesting thread but i dont agree. the benefit of closing line value is that its much less volatile than results. short term closing line value  short term results no doubt about it. the downside of closing line value is that it requires the assumption that the closing line is efficient. (1/x)
aluckyaday,it will be interesting to see how widely available gambling and alcohol sit together in the us. that is one thing the european books have not been able to get past the legislators in the uk. unlike the us there has been a tradition of keeping gambling and alcohol well separated.
aluckyaday,because uneducated punters may understand that to mean they will ban anyone who wins through any means. if i asked my mother what she understood by that statement she would not understand it to mean they ban anyone who is betting with an edge but allow people to win using luck.
aluckyaday,do years old have any evidence to support your theory that restrictions are  detrimental to racing? personally i think the levy is an ou touchdown ated idea. if you wanted to start a new sport and said it will be funded by bookmaker profits i doubt you would get very far...
aluckyaday,this is way more important than arguing about whether one sided bets should be allowed. market forces will adjust the margin on those type of bets to a level that is acceptable to the consumer. it won't help the vulnerable who are hidden from public view. look in the storm drains
aluckyaday,not sure about that one. the graph is always going to start with zero in the left and the current profit on the right with some sort of line connecting them. what do you think  can fairly consistent returns be a sign of skill? is there a way to measure that?
aluckyaday,i think the fact that the sharp market is global makes it incredibly difficult. sharps  daily fantasy sports  worry too much about regulation . if you want to bet with pinnacle or in asia you can wherever you live. to survive they have to out pinnacle pinnacle which won't be easy!
aluckyaday,american books allowing obviously +ev without blinking an eyelid . that is not how european books do things! if you routinely take what they know to be +ev bets they  daily fantasy sports  want your business. you have to decide whats worth more your account or the time limited easy +ev?
aluckyaday,if you want to test how likely your returns are due to skill you can use this excellent calculator here  set f2 to average odds f3 to zero f6 to number of bets g10 to your actual roi and f10 will give you the chance of your roi occurring by chance.
aluckyaday,please be aware that as regression to the mean is likely to occur this date may change each month a bit like easter. spooky that today is the 15th i had not planned it that way and had no idea that would come out top when i started mining this morning!
aluckyaday,"""marco blume trading director at pinnacle has said that the closing line is on average very very accurate that the sharps are beating it"" that line is a very misleading.  sharps  daily fantasy sports  beat it on average if they had to bet every line they would lose. they bet selectively"
theFirmAISports,im right there with you. my goal is to make as many +ev bets as possible but i saw the refund numbers at the start of this thread and was a little surprised. marketing aspect it did catch my attention. i like that youre willing to put your money behind it
joeytunes2,"this is a standard practice  in all books. i have been dealing with this not only in regulated markets but ""un"". theres 2 ways to approach this. be a true bookmaker and gold standard  (as i am a high rated player) and adjust hard and move. also use me for info."
joeytunes2,bookies use software and auto movers. (computer programs) also known as a bot. get me a bookmaker that moves his own lines. and i wont use my bots. a old fashion duel. no one works harder then me. i will beat you one way or another.  it is  just the facts.
joeytunes2,yes your 100 percent  right. but they beg for picks. so  that is  fine. if its entertainment purposes. so be it. but i'd rather be wrong and have an opinion then listen to anyone else. it feels good to win on your own. these hammerheads you pay for arent winners anyway.
joeytunes2,he was winning. so many haters but everyone blew him. was happy for him. my motive is always money. if you win call me. not bc your handsome because my motive is money. he didnt win. i didnt bet on it. i'm more disciplined then believing. the 100k pro bettors twitter
GolcondaFund,uhhh. false. you are not a victim. you are a con. you did not intend to win it was a marketing scam. you said mexico would pay for the wall. over promise under deliver. i prioritize reality checks above all else and you have been nothing but a spoiled greedy fraud.
GolcondaFund,"too early but when daniel jones got drafted my first inclination was - ""oh yeah that duke qb he was always solid."" then everyone made fun of giants pick. then he went off in pre-season. then he did last night. when public consensus is so blatant and tense -- fade that."
nonrandomalpha,this approach to p ratings is so antiquated; a product of old vegas + boomer degenerates. if power ratings are so reactive and backward looking how is it useful or actionable? p ratings should be forward looking and if were valuable at all already have priced a lot of this in.
LeeSharpeNFL,"these changes were desired by me in part of my work to find a more predictive expected points added and so i figured i'd share them with you all.

i also held them until after monday night football  because changing game-scraping code right before games is a path toward failure. :p"
LeeSharpeNFL,"have patriots camera crews been doing this for a bunch of games this year? the patriots statement implies no. if they have  that is  clearly more suspicious.

but if you are gonna do a fake production crew in place for football reasons why would you roll that out with the bengals?"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i used league-wise totals for 2003 and 2018 to see how to era-adjust the brees first 38 starts numbers.

with it adjusted...  that is  a lot fewer completions yards  touchdown s. i'll give him ny/a though that is close.

despite this brees likely is an outlier. any other qbs like this?"
LeeSharpeNFL,"q: why does every site have to list the sunday early window games in a different order? can't we all agree an on order?

a: apparently no. after all  lists the games in **reverse id** order so i  daily fantasy sports  know i would expect anyone else to follow their ids."
LeeSharpeNFL,"there is an intuitive logic to wanting as an underdog to control top so the number of plays in the game is less in theory creating a higher variance game.

the problem to me is that if you're an underdog you're probably not going to promote variance through the run game."
whale_capper,yes so in the last kc game closing spread/total implied 26.5-16.5... 16.5 for den would be ~24th percentile or a z-score of -0.66... they actually scored 3 which is 3rd  percent tile or a z-score of -1.97... the delta tells you den o under-performed (or kc d over-perf) by 1.3 sigma
JoeyKnish22,i knew somebody was gonna bring this up lol. i think taylor was better than reed player to player. obviously reed had the longer career accomplished more but for me taylor was the goat (short time frame). reed was strictly a fs. taylor could play either fs/ss at an elite level
JoeyKnish22,hell be 31 has had 4 season ending injuries isnt close to the player he was and is famous enough to be the next romo or big studio personality and make great money doing that. had also alluded to in interviews he doesnt plan to play that much longer. no chance?
LockyLockerson,yeah sorry the initial tweet with the checks straight down was what got me since booker out is a suns thing.  have you followed what teams have done against the spread in these 1-game/star out situations this season?   it is  been incredibly wild.  team missing star has covered at insane clip.
LockyLockerson,"well just in terms of growth there was lamar ""didn't know the playbook"" jackson the year before he won the heisman. also completely remade offense this year too at least gives him a chance. i think martell ends up starting but  that is  just my guess by all accounts its close"
DannyParkins,saw the irishmen last night. it didnt fly by like say a wolf of wall street as a 3+ hour film but im glad i saw it in a theatre because a scorsese picture with deniro pesci pacino (who i thought was especially great) and others deserved the old school experience.
DannyParkins,"facts:

no team has picked up 5th year option on a 2017 pick yet

most dont til april

pace vowed to pick up floyds at end of year (jan 19)

hes had 2 chances to make the same commitment to trubisky  hasnt

free agency  draft happen before 5th year deadline

DannyParkins,im really proud of jay for this. the amount of work it takes to write a book has always seemed daunting. jay took his passion for hockey and made a cottage industry out of it with multiple podcasts and now this. i hope the whole  family supports him  buys this book!
Gingfacekillah,"i just ran a test on a model idea that speaks to your point. ~1000 wagers 2.14 percent  yield. seems alright until you consider the p-value is 0.334 with a 1 in x probability of 2. pick any ""hot streak"" in the middle and isolate it and you'd be foolishly overconfident."
Gingfacekillah,awesome man have fun at lca! wood thoroughly impressed. griffin looked a little mechanical. curious to see if he drives to the bucket this season or if pass/3p are going to be his mainstays. i've got iso joe rated as +/- 0.1 to the spread so i suppose he matched expectations
Gingfacekillah,for what  it is  worth  i think the pistons are closer to a 39-41 win team this season. generally  daily fantasy sports  like these type of bets though because when you consider the time-value of the money being tied up you can usually make more by keeping it in your bankroll.
Gingfacekillah,modelling in excel has allowed be to produce days like this. i've moved on to more advanced models in r/python and as a result i'm happy to share what i know about excel models because its win-win - you'll get something of great value and it doesn't kill my golden goose.
Gingfacekillah,21-5 the last 4 days. on a bit of a heater.  daily fantasy sports  expect it to keep up but cruising along at ~7 percent  this month. hopefully can hit the ground running and trap some decent value for the start of mlb. will be focusing on half innings derivatives mostly.

logan_matthews9,so either you say all the pieces were in place and jk was just right place right time in 2 different countries or you admit that hes great at developing a federation structure to develop players. and then you cant possibly call his time anything but a success for ussfs future
logan_matthews9,"morris is 24! and lost a whole year to a torn acl. like hes some washed up dude or something...

and yes bringing up young players too early has never hurt the us. just look at notable studs like adu julian green agudelo rubio rubin hyndman joe gyau josh gatt etc"
logan_matthews9,but theres value in having the best 11 players on the field too. jozy vs zardes is a whole different thing but putting pulisic central so mihailovic doesnt have to play is fine by me. designing the rb/cdm for adamss strengths and our consistent black hole at lb is cool too
logan_matthews9,bring in capela! solid contract fits the long athletic mold of tatum brown smart. locked in four more years. 25 years old on a similar timeline to the other names - would also leave them with room to either bring back rozier or sign a replacement whereas vuc caps them out
logan_matthews9,gb is a tactical coach whereas jurgen was a development/structure guy. you can be upset about the result last night or not like his tactics but to compare the 2 is ridiculous. thats not even defending gb - 6 months in jk had completely revamped the coaching structure in the us

yet imagine if nobody spoke up about rip-offs simply bc there are idiots who are happy."
PikachuBets,he's getting hate not bc he's not sharing publicly. he promised twitter would get rich by handing over outs. he hyped up his operation. he braggggged on and on about nailing 70u (!!!) in those accts. he's getting hate bc he was a clueless naive grade a asshat. simple as that.
adamchernoff,we obviously can not take away a play that has happened but getting back to the point from a bookmakers perspective this was a game that there was clear support for the 49ers who as a whole thoroughly dominated the game but the result left many bettors holding a losing ticket.
adamchernoff,"most telling point is that nobody knows which ""sharps"" are on which game. if you do not know which bettors were betting at which price and your goal is to blindly tail those bettors how can you risk money on the crutch of your reasoning being entirely unknown?!  it is  insane!"
adamchernoff,i hope that is the first step (of many) in easing the pressure from the fans off of the back of queiroz when he makes the right decision to start duvan over falcao...sometime in the future. long way to go but he adds a different dynamic that the team needs upfront.
adamchernoff,"i am excited for this one.

12Xpert,i've already shown you my own data that disputes this skewness. i can show you a distribution of expected roi based on odds movement (if you subscribe to clvh). that is symmetrical about the margin too. if you have a hypothesis test it  daily fantasy sports  just suppose  it is  true.
12Xpert,i'm guessing the methodology penalised man city and tottenham relative to liverpool for not drawing very much. perhaps that implies that awarding 1 point for a draw is too high relative to the points you get for a win. how would the table look if it was 4 for a win?
12Xpert,i still believe it is the second. after 14 years of proofing tipsters i'm still inclined to believe that overconfidence is far more common than deliberately misleading people. to be fair i was the same when i started out and it took me a long time to figure out these things.

mschwimer,that is correct. i dont think they will. i have proof of this. we have been around for 6 months. free to everyone. lots of big players subscribe. lines have not moved too much. all i can go on is my experience. but over time they most certainly will. i agree.
mschwimer,"now can you please answer my question? i have answered every single one of yours. yet you avoid mine. 

if you believe a single word you say why wouldnt you buy 100+ packages. we are giving you 2.3-1 odds! we have not said no to a single one of your terms."
mschwimer,our system is based on subscribers betting $300 per play. they can do whatever we want. but our system is based on that number. $300 is easy to get down on the plays we post. feel free to check all our plays on our site. everything is available to the public.
mschwimer,people have told me their site allows action regardless.  however i checked with 2 us books and they agree with what you said.  i will go back and look at each pick that was made before a pitching change was announced and make those no bets. thank you for the help!
mschwimer,all my advice is tournament advice. strategy is to be top 10 percent  or last.  in this case we were last. however this is the 4th time i did  daily fantasy sports  advice and 2 of the 4 i came in top 10 percent . as always its about sample size.

RufusPeabody,im not asking you to change an industry. im asking you to display actual records rather than cherry picked *hot streaks* you get by dividing your plays up into all these different categories so when you filter by play type unit and day of the week something is always hot.
RufusPeabody,a bettor expected to hit 49 percent  has a 0.62 percent  chance of going 45 percent  or worse over 1000 picks. if a million recreational bettors with a true skill of 49 percent  each pick 1000 games we'd expect 6194 will be 45 percent  or worse due *entirely* to randomness.
RufusPeabody,people seem to be taking this at face value. the line move info is actually publicly available. schwimer promised to release the line move report but never has. why not? makes you wonder... my hunch? this is just pr on his part to save face. willing to be proven wrong.
RufusPeabody,i get that cappercon is a business. fine. but i disagree that the presence of a bettor advocacy nonprofit would upset an operator (like hard rock) sponsoring the event. abc wants the same thing as most operators -- to see sports betting in the u.s. succeed in a sustainable way.
SportsCheetah,lebron assists over to start season. they start 11-2 but it would be boring doing a lebron assists over segment every day. hawks overs after collins got hurt. heat unders after dragic got hurt. if youre not using the info to get ahead of future moves because i said id
SportsCheetah,i honestly dont know what youre saying most of this is incoherent. i was just giving you an example of if vegas decided to make wash the favorite in the division they wouldnt have been the favorite by the time the season started like philly was. the bettors dictate prices.
SportsCheetah,ill never forget one of the nba all-star weekends awhile back they did a game of horse and rajon rondo hit 12 or 13 3s in a row against kd before finally missing one and losing (kd made 13 or 14 straight). this was back in 20 percent  rondo days.

ClevTA,not sure if hes referring to dorsey or not but i really dont think hes done a good job overall. wouldnt be opposed to keeping him and giving him one more offseason but the guy had a historical treasure trove of picks  cap  not sure hes been effective with it
ClevTA,i've also had an affinity towards special teams coaches. bc they dont mettle in the o or d they typically let those coaches coach  they manage the team. they also take pride in the special teams where other hcs ignore it  are tasked knowing quirky rules. might be an inefficency
ClevTA,ill admit i initially liked the kitchens hire. obv i was wrong but for those throwing stones at the hc search who did they pass on who was a good candidate? look at the rookie hcs. was any a legit good hire. harbaugh riley were my top choices  werent available
ClevTA,biggest adv for browns tonight is not having to face staley at lt. backup justin skule in debut vs pitt had the lowest pff pass blocking grade on the sf ol allowed 2 pressures  was called for a whopping 3 penalties. not allowing jg time for playaction  misdirections is huge
ClevTA,what are u talking about. theyll be favored in at least 8 of their final 9 gms and maybe all of them depending on pitt qb. they can easily win like 7-8 gms and finish with 10/11 gms. no team would start much better than 3-4:4-3 with this early sked

CizzlingSports,there is no instant payout. if you are a 17-week subscriber you have to ride out the entire 17-weeks before any right to payment is triggered. and even then there's the minor issue that jambos may never make good on 50+ $10000.00 payments since there's no security for the debt
spanky,"its either he was limited to $25 on nfl and he took a parting shot or he took the shot and was then subsequently limited across the board...  

the $150 bet amount makes me believe him because i would think he could bet higher had he not been limited already...."
spanky,you called me a twit. youre a nerd who hides behind a computer screen who obviously has no experience dealing with any street bookmakers. youre an actuary because youre not good enough to bet professionally.  you can cheer me or boo me just know your place is in the crowd.
spanky,i agree and im all for players rights but one cant realistically expect a book to pay a $1000000 mistake.  that being said the book should not be able to play god and decide whats off vs. bad. prior explict definition of what constitutes an error should be clearly defined.
spanky,my system auto grades. one of the guys in my office will sometimes break down the good or bad fortune to me but i rarely watch anything live.  once the game starts there are either more sports to bet or productive things to do.  watching sports has sadly become unenjoyable.
spanky,you've partnered yourself with a bad customer service team who told the lady to fu*k off.  i believe you personally didn't tell her that but you must take responsibility for people you align yourself with.  if my guy chinese mike did something wrong i would own it.  all good bro
spanky,so i spent a couple of hours betting at  today.  limits in  college basketball  are fair. they dont want me betting on the app but welcome my plays in person.  maybe cuz resorts shares in the liability?  is opposite. they would rather me bet on the app vs in person.
spanky,this may be such a minute point but it stuck with me for years and i thought id share it.  if you are going to play the lotto you should always play numbers above 31 eliminating the birthday factor. this will of course reduce the chance of chopping the jackpot.
spanky,they fired one of the best bookmakers in mike c. and since then everything has went to shits.  nevada will never have another bookmaker book 40k on college football sides on tuesday for a saturday game.  a big part of old school vegas bookmaking died when mike c. was fired.

aluckyaday,america is all about freedom the books should be able to do what they want the people will decide if restriconsts are acceptable. personally i think they are. punters have a choice to bet with a restricting soft book best for recreational players or a sharp book best for sharps.

aluckyaday,"i think this quote is particularly telling ""a company that has actually only managed to grow after having embraced the very thing that it set out to destroy. a company that said that it was going to destroy the traditional bookmaker but that ended up being owned by one. """
aluckyaday,they are only efficient on average. pricing errors appear to be random but i believe pinnacle etc play with the line when they can. for a bookmaker betting at an efficient price is sub optimal. they have market and customer models to find the line that make the most profit
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  think that is correct. they are writing in english not latin. in english unlike latin correct grammar is to have an article before a noun phrases. magna carta is a noun phrase and should therefor be preceded by a article when referring to it in english.
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  see the point of showing overround. recreational punters want to back a horse. they can see the price for that horse on each board. if they are not savvy enough to compare the price on different boards how the hell is overround going to help them?

EdMillerPoker,yeah thats why i like it. beyond that it gets pretty damn complex to write these laws. like for example say someone figured out a bug in my sportsbook software that allowed him to send multiple simultaneous bets and he jams in 10 limit bets on something using this bug.
EdMillerPoker,"if youre running an event like this and marketing to grinders who expect an roi on the entry fee youre nuts. if youre signing up expecting an roi also nuts.

tbh i think most people involved in these events on either side basically understand this is the deal but hey."
EdMillerPoker,if you book or bet college football halftimes you will want to check us out today. we're going to try to put up every game today first before the rest of the market. why not see what we make it before you put your line up or make a bet.
EdMillerPoker,but the mature gameday major markets in big sports like nfl mlb nba  college football  are tough to beat. totals generally easier to beat than sides. the people who do beat them almost all do some substantial analytical work along with trading (rather than just see line bet line done)
EdMillerPoker,it is  for sure not even close to zero skill and i thot i saw they were unlimiting accts for the duration if limited players wanted in. if they let you just blast them for 3 days completely unlimited beyond the $5k toy bankroll it would be a great opp.
EdMillerPoker,i think dk is better positioned than anyone else to dominate the us market. but to go from better positioned to actual domination they have to meet a few core needs and do it well. i think they're a dog to do that so i guess i'd bet the field.
EdMillerPoker,no one can actually lower the hold and take a bet on american sports today because they will lose.  that is  what i mean when i say the infrastructure doesn't exist. that will change. once it does you will begin to see how the business models play against one another.
GolcondaFund,to note - the reason we were on kc besides the situation and the better team desperate to win is broncos are not dynamic. in that they've competed against teams that play like they do or like chargers very injured. bears jags titans are the types of teams matchup with.

nonrandomalpha,"are you following our multi-sport total return fund?

 it is  early but you can see our performance has been stellar. nonetheless  it is  not just performance that is important but the amount of risk being taken by the manager.

nonrandomalpha,"team turnovers year-over-year are wildly volatile. for example in '17 the browns were -28 (ik ik  what the fuck  right? f'kn 28. dumpster fire) in '18 the browns were +7 a swing of 35 turnovers (i did that hard math 4 u). 

more bullish ammo for the niners this season."
LeeSharpeNFL,the main thing i can think of is at some point in games the coach with the leads starts playing to the clock rather than playing to maximize offensive efficiency. maybe coaches do this later in playoff games! because of the higher leverage maybe they want to keep pressure on?
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah this is why i wanted to see the all 22. 

this doesn't apply to the (two!) receivers short and over the middle who were wide open.

but yes i suspect anthony miller (#17) probably wasn't truly open though the safety almost certainly moved away from him after the throw."
LeeSharpeNFL,"let us  remember that going into 2019 the thought was ""trubisky needs to take a big step forward"".

he hasn't. last night was his best game in terms of epa/play all year. he had four games better than that last year.

2018: 0.17 epa/play
2019: 0.00 epa/play

he's gotten worse."
LeeSharpeNFL,"there's no reason to believe this is true. over time team records in one score games is highly unstable from year to year.

also carroll isn't good at this. the punt at the end of overtime in the 49ers game was hugely negative and he was lucky it worked out."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i learned scripting on perl and it took me a while after python came out to convert to python. maybe the same will happen with r but maybe not. i mostly like r.

whale_capper,if you have a top 3 qb in the league your floor should be 10 wins and yet they are performing from a scoring standpoint like a 9-win team because of an insistence to run in poor situations and a resistance to make +ev decisions regarding when to be aggressive

AndyMSFW,"sage advice... we talked about this on the  that drops tonight.  chasing the steam or following ""what the sharps are on"" just means you're on the same side as someone who got a much better number than you.  betting the worst of the number isn't a good long term plan"
JoeyKnish22,i do think clemson +5.5/6 is a bit rich. but i am much less bullish on that number than many of my peers. would be a small play for me if i had nothing on the game. but its not the banger some ppl appear to think it is imo.
LockyLockerson,"because openers for  college basketball  have started to pop at best of luck and 5d a reminder that the locky patreon page will not just do nba.

LockyLockerson,"there are still so many roster things to get ironed out for all teams that i can't really give you any type of detailed projection right now.  too many moving parts.  but all i can say is if the previous number was ""correct"" any movement is not rooted in logic."
DannyParkins,i always assume theres a lot we dont know in situations like tyreek hills and we can only evaluate things based on the information available. that said id love to know what his defense was for you should be terrified of me too bitch that allowed him to avoid suspension.
Gingfacekillah,i did feel weird about the game. it was an admittedly large spread for bos to cover against sac. numbers looked good though at home no reason not to play for it. they showed form by creating an 11 point separation down the stretch just lost a grip on it.
Gingfacekillah,from what i've seen pace doesn't vary as much as many people think. i has a range different for both nba   college basketball  but you can do a number of things to get a decent estimate of it like median pace for example. the real difficulty imo is forecasting og.
Gingfacekillah,worst part about learning a new stats language (r) is knowing what you want to do but not knowing how to translate it into a the new language. want to bootstrap samples and use mle to estimate parameters and  it is  taken several hours to import and frame data. #learningcurve
Gingfacekillah,awesome idea. i'm currently running my models in excel. it takes longer and uses dozens of sheets to produce what i'm sure would be an elegant process in r or matlab but i would be starting from beginner level with those platforms. i guess its time to reconsider learning r.
Gingfacekillah,ah yes the empty net skew. thank you for the reminder i'll have to adjust for that. agree with you this isn't my best performing model. i've had more success with latent team ratings. trying to make this one better to see if it can have any value long term.
Gingfacekillah,"lets all take a moment to consider how ungodly rich any bettor would be if they could hit 70 percent  over even 1000 bets that were +ev then consider the probability that they would utter a single word about it to anyone else on earth.

0.0001 percent   fair odds: 10000.00"
Gingfacekillah,this type of motivation spotting is so dicey. for every point you can make about a team needing a win or being charged up to play there is a counter argument. totally agree with you that narrative handicapping is up there with consulting a magic 8 ball for predictive power.
logan_matthews9,"this is pretty fascinating. obviously playing as though you have an edge on every game is crazy but even if it was just even value you could churn through rollovers and bonuses so easily that it would become profitable at small stakes

logan_matthews9,not really. they have two good players one of which will almost definitely be retired and the other will be on the wrong side of 30 and injury prone. they have basically no way to upgrade their roster over that span assuming they max some mid-tier fa out this summer

adamchernoff,"estimates it could be a $14m industry in canada.

divisional totals getting bet down at cris/pin this morning. someone in love with the rematch trend almost across the board..."
adamchernoff,at +100 each individual leg of a teaser would have to hit at 70 percent  to break even. could you point to a range of 4 points in college basketball you could cross with a teaser that would increase win probability 18 percent  from the standard 52.4 percent  at -110?
adamchernoff,interesting again? based on prices  line movement this week went 5-9 on sides and 7-7 on totals. last week sides and totals each went 4-12. of 68 possible sides and totals this nfl season only 20 (29 percent ) of games have ended in the direction of which line moved.
adamchernoff,will do! now that i am out of the big city i am getting back into smoking and grilling on a weekly basis. experimenting with recipes from south carolina at the moment (my favourite bbq region) but slowly getting into texas style bbq too. tough to source good mesquite though!
adamchernoff,the #nfl100 season kicks off tonight so i thought it would be a good time to post a thread with links to articles i have written over the past 2-3 years relating to nfl betting and give everyone something to think about this upcoming season. links in the thread below
adamchernoff,fair and reasonable rebuttal!  daily fantasy sports  see much of those on twitter. might have been a bit harsh on the o line but thing it is an enormous step back without williams. agree you are in the range with the expectation though. thanks for taking the time to listen.
adamchernoff,depending on how you look at it it can be viewed as unfortunate that a very frequent path for a bettor to enter the market and learn is through paying a handicapper or accepting payment as a handicapper. sports gambling overall is viewed by many as a competition of being...
adamchernoff,before closing line value comes expected value which is important. positive expected value is calculated by your probability of winning * your amount won per bet less your probability of losing * your amount lost per bet. the easiest way to illustrate this is to use a coin toss example.
adamchernoff,"the 2019 nfl season strength of schedule matrix is a handy tool to keep around you desk this offseason. 

all 32 opponents listen by implied probability to win the super bowl. full season opponent sum plus start and finish schedule ranks on the right. 

 = top 8
 = bottom 8"
adamchernoff,as with any international tournament handicapping one match ahead is an easy way to get well ahead of the price. first round results always dictate second round prices as the match is going on. if you have a strong lean in match one look ahead to match two this monday/tuesday.
adamchernoff,long winded reply coming. if you are looking for a beach holiday as in white sand blue water nice chairs all you can eat/drink and 30+ degrees with burning sun then i would not suggest going to colombia - unless you are visiting san andres or providencia. even then you're
adamchernoff,maybe what got me more was the last drive play calling. mcvay reid payton bill and rodgers (wouldnt put it on mccarthy) all look at play action on those late drive spots where a first down ices it. lynn and co. slammed two runs into 9 man fronts then punted.

Ccon8181,tough way to end the day. #arizona was a strong side as they match up well with #buffs . dont know how manny bunnies ant free throw they missed. sean millers reputation should take a big hit his team struggles with fundamentals and b-ball iq. 2things that dont require talent.

TheCousinSal,betting houses are putting the 2020 astros hit by pitch count between 80  83.5 which seems insane to me. 1 beaning every other game is a lot especially when there will be warnings suspensions etc. go under but also hedge bet on the team trainer to quit by memorial day.
12Xpert,depends what odds you have and whether you only took out the 0-0 retirements. i also took the matches where the odds were the same for each player. here's the first 5 lines in my spread sheet you can see the formula for he favourites column. opposite for the dogs.
12Xpert,"yes you're trolling. trolling is just showing up to be insulting.
what gives you the idea i  daily fantasy sports  think pinny scores clients  corrects odds accordingly? find me the place where i wrote that.
if you were really good at practice i wouldn't be having this conversation with you."
12Xpert,"exactly i just  daily fantasy sports  get the concept. it just seems to be ""here's a bet from a pro go bet it at a soft book and get restricted"" so i'm not seeing how  it is  better than what's already available by way of tipsters for average joe punter."
12Xpert,i think others have revealed that  it is  about their 2up offer. they appear now to be advertising the inferior prices that come with this offer on the odds comparisons. if you want the better odds you  daily fantasy sports  get the 2up offer. at least  that is  my understanding
12Xpert,"dear  i'd like to 'request a bet' via #yourodds. could you please tell me what odds you will offer for the following.
""your affiliate team to resolve non-payment of affiliate revenue with 14 days of telling me my valid neteller id is invalid."" we are 7 days in so far"
12Xpert,basically i test my margin removal model against blanket betting and try to get a random walk about the profit line. but if i achieve that this does not imply my model is correct because it could be that pinny's prices are intentionally inefficient. we just  daily fantasy sports  know.

RufusPeabody,started listening to the jambos qa podcast and had to stop after 10 mins. its everything that  and i rail against on our pod. creating narratives around results using small sample size as an excuse in one sentence but then drawing conclusions from a small sample in the next
jeffma,ha i dont question or care about media records. i know cheetah is a long term winner because i have actually seen his p/l over the years and i respect his process. cheetah would be the first to admit and own if he sucked giving out picks on espn
jeffma,ha. you made every play and every bold call and deserved to win. but your coach and backup qb are making it seem like a real mystery how it happened. and among sports fans we is a popular pronoun. it does connote that we played for the said team
jeffma,this is making my head hurt. the parlay only makes sense if 1) you think you have edge on both bets and want to get more down 2) you think the bets are somehow correlated. i doubt either is the case so would say it is a bad strategy
jeffma,for the record... yes it was a touty tweet... that was intentional. did we gain some marketing from it... probably... was that the intention... no... does it matter... probably not... for the record i was 0-4 on my nfl picks on  and am now getting beat by a monkey
SportsCheetah,doc mentioning postgame their 5-26 3-point shooting being wide-open for all but 2 attempts. blamed halloween for poor shooting (possibly). still waiting on some 4q data to roll in but of 20 3s for lac their x3pt percent  was 49 percent   and they shot 25 percent  on those attempts.
SportsCheetah,milw u57.5 -110 - brogdon .50/.40/.90 plays for ind now. coach bud embraces the load management approach and giannis plays even fewer games. wes matthews starts. they surrendered the most 3s/100 in nba last year (bud special). not sure how often that will = #1 d in today's nba.
capjack2000,"wait. is  going to be supplying lines for  to supply to sportsbooks for people to bet into?

i realize metric operates in shady markets in far away lands but we need to get them in the us after this news. 

fish are in the barrel folks bring your guns."
capjack2000,"their offer to the state was that if they were chosen as the only mobile provider they'd pay a 51 percent  tax rate. if they had to compete they would pay a lower rate. 

nh let the operators bid on what tax rate they would be willing to pay."
capjack2000,"maybe our friend at age 23 has that kind of bankroll. maybe he's a sharp who recognizes how a parlay can add leverage to +ev bets. however he's betting these at william hill. 

they're not dumb. 

i suspect they leaked the story to rovell in the first place.

conclusion..."
capjack2000,"contrary to popular belief i'm not in favor of a world where everyone tries to be a pinnacle. 

the sports wagering industry should exist on a spectrum where there are some pinnacles and some kambis and many others in-between.

a heavy dose of either of those models is doom."
capjack2000,"daily fantasy sports  get me started on swima.  it is  a farce.  it is  used more to exchange information on sharp bettors than anything else. 

crowdsourcing data from a group that has no experience with suspicious betting patterns makes everything look like suspicious betting. this idea is a fail."
capjack2000,"while i was out of the garden state for a few days william hill dropped a new mobile app. 

my understanding is that this app is highly portable to other states. so if you're wondering where the william hill mobile app is in your state this is a preview."
capjack2000,he is a close friend of george norcross who is a major force in anything done in south jersey. his brother phil norcross wrote the state's sports betting law. at one time pennwood morris and norcross all wanted the same thing a big sports betting parlor in cherry hill.
capjack2000,"that is  what will happen in the us. right now we've got some acesgold jokers in the market. the pinnys will emerge. 

the difference here is recourse and regulation. if you feel wronged you have legitimate regulators. not the phony osga and the like we had back then. 2/2"
capjack2000,to calculate the average margin translate the odds of yes to implied probability and add them all together. it will be over 100 percent . that amount over is the margin. you can then factor out that  percent  from the original odds to come up with a vig-free line.
dinkinc,to see these people finally get to a national stage and in time set the standard for wrestling for the future validates my fandom and that of my  family the  vs  title match on usa t.v was probably a million to one shot 5  years ago but its here
dinkinc,someone  who is an ass took  my tweet about september variance as an excuse for my losing plays.. first the roster expands to 40 and aa players get thrown into games with no rhyme or reason..second i post my results every day..accurate results..third i tout for charity so stfu
dinkinc,so when you say a team will open things up offensively under a new coach do you look to bet overs or do you add some points to the total you project under the old coach and bet accordingly...if so how do you decide how many points to add?
dinkinc,stop showing these photos please.... all they do is make everyone afraid to donate to the good ones thinking they might be contributing to stuff like this.... maybe everyone will donate to old friends only or not at all...we know she is trash.. no need to see the visuals
RASPicks,not sure how many times i have to repeat this for you. when someone is proven to be so flat dead wrong on something they are so adamant about how do you trust that person to do anything else they say? i'd much prefer to focus on other endeavors.
RASPicks,if you think no one can get down (even with a bot) on our releases you haven't tried lately and/or are not very well informed.  also if recruiting accounts from customers was our business model we'd have a ton more accounts.  truth is we have turned down countless offers.
RASPicks,just to follow up house is getting +110 bettors are -110.  but more so just have never found bet percentages to have predictive value on their own so irks me to see such strategies and/or content promoted.  if someone has compelling evidence to the contrary would love to see.
suuma810,"the #jets have gregg but they also have this schedule:

- 2nd-easiest by pinny win totals
- 3rd-easiest by 2018 offensive epa
- fewest travel miles
- zero games outside the eastern time zone
- bye week before road game at philly
- at miami in november (less heat)"
suuma810,would have been a stronger angle last year but not enough for me when you have arguably the worst pass d vs what looks to be a solid team. skins off their bye have no clue how to attack them. penalties and blown coverages been killing them as well.
ClevTA,ok. so they were +6 at indy yesterday. which equates essentially to indy pk at den. so if u believe den is 1 point  pitt that means indy -1 at pitt is the correct line. sometimes i have to perform that exercise if i think a line is off.
ClevTA,guess my point is the clipps are devastating defensive team when pg comes back  that defense is absolutely sustainable whereas the lakers got an insane shooting gm from green and its not against such a good def tm. bottom line is clipps are the much better team to me
ClevTA,saints have 1 cover in the last 5 years in weeks 1 and 2. and watson is 4-1 against the spread as a road dog in his career and the one loss was by 0.5 points in last seasons opener. saints in prime time is def the fear tho
ClevTA,i have generic fantasy thoughts on guys who i like based on adp. id direct everyone to  for deeper analysis  his great worksheet. but if u want a couple of my thoughts here u go. i'm obv high on certain rbs who i think will have up  touchdown  regression
CizzlingSports,"he thought sf traveled back home to ca between the bal and no games and thus picked no two weeks ago (sf actually stayed in fl between bal and no)

he also thought det was playing at tam this past week.

not kidding.

spanky,"if you have a video of  saying college hoops is beatable and someone signs up who wants to bet college hoops and then possibly gets limited to $100 it sends a wrong message

dont have bill make videos on sports that you dont accept sharp action on. its misleading"
spanky,"a pick is only worth the line its bet on and if it had any value the line probably wouldnt exist.

one mans opinion wont outweigh the market long term. instead of searching for winning picks focus on beating the closing line. doing so will eventually yield winners organically"
spanky,"and to the touts that claim to bet their own money but need the security blanket of taking money off their fellow bettors by selling picks - cut the bullshit.

its either you bet professionally or you sell picks professionally. this market aint big enough for a middle ground."
spanky,on last sunday before school starts (which is usually last sunday before nfl starts)  my kids run a lemonade stand.  they earn pretty good. in fact had i known about how good the earn was when i was a kid i woulda done it every weekend in the summer!
spanky,"short term wins and losses are more cloudy since each outcome is essentially 50/50. 

however not every game moves. when you significantly beat a closing line in majority of your pieces this is a measure of skill. im not talking about a few pennies or a half point either."
spanky,"ive been called many things but a gipsy cockroach is a new one.

according to your numbers my business makes about 100k a year. 
i have six full time employees (most with kids). 

i concede. how can i sign up for dream team sports picks?

#gamblingtwitter at its finest."
spanky,the perfect hustle may be unfolding.  bet the loser and drive the price down. have the world believe that the integrity of the oscars is indisputable. next year bookmakers nationwide offer higher limits and  daily fantasy sports  move as aggressively. of course thats when the knock out blow lands
spanky,started taking 8k from me the first day.  then it went down to apprx 2k/1k which lasted a few weeks with choppy results.they bought me steaks put me up at resorts etc... then one saturday i held 32 percent  won 65k and i was banned the very next day.
spanky,i dont bet the superbowl.  my bankroll was built on betting soft numbers and beating the closing line. the superbowl is the sharpest number of the year.  there is public pressure for both sharps and recreational players that you must bet the super bowl. dont fall into the trap.
spanky,this is the fragile market per head era.  there used to be 100 different line sets now there are 10.  is it unfair that most bms auto copy their lines from others? unfair vs fair is irrelevant in an unregulated environment. to succeed one must adjust adapt and overcome.
spanky,despite knowing of me or knowing me personally very few bookmakers book me directly.  without betting partners getting me outs i would be out of business.  i rely on the anonymity of offshore betting accounts to run my business.  its a cat and mouse game that is very tiring
spanky,im sorry kelly if it came across as facetious.  when i think of the name kelly and im talking gambling your name pops into my head and not the kelly criterion.  i think that says a lot for the strides you made in this business. no ill will intended...
spanky,when i caught the will hill kick out on tape i felt as if i can be a voice to change the landscape of regulated bookmaking in america before the virus spread.  will admit the video helped spark his investigation. one day my kids could potentially run my business
spanky,everyone always talks about why they would bet team a vs team b but i never see any discussion on a comparison of pricing on team a.  not knowing what every half point is worth is similar to shopping for products in multiple currencies without knowing the exchange rate.
spanky,doesnt have any online betting limits.this subject to approval crap really needs to end.if you have a house limit and i ask for morethen of course it needs approval. but not having a house limit and seeing what i want to bet first gives bm unfair air move temptation
PlusEVAnalytics,to come back to my favourite topic of parameter uncertainty how would you go about making a full-kelly offer to a player who is a randomly selected member of the american population? and how do you pick offer 2 conditional on the revealed preferences from rejection of offer 1?
PlusEVAnalytics,thats the million dollar question - need to find a good data source. basically the game is to take every hole a guy has played in his career back out the effects of that course and that weather and add in the effects of this course and this weather.

aluckyaday,i believe there are really only two way sharps can openly bet with soft books. either you are very good pr for them or you provide them with information they can't get elsewhere. if you  daily fantasy sports  fit those criteria you will likely have a very long wait.
aluckyaday,the way a court would decide if the 2 are related would be to gather expert opinion on whether given you know a player from a team won the man of steel would the odds for them being in the top 5 of the league be significantly different. 3/x
aluckyaday,its not something that needs discussing. its just math as you put it. what is the maximum expected bankroll at $300 per point using your kelly staking plan? its something your quants should know and you should be able to answer immediately. i guess the number is too scary?
aluckyaday,could give us poor lazy english speakers a breakdown of what has happened so far in spain in regard to bet365 and restrictions. what laws are being contested how far it has gone in the justice system and how much further has it to go? many would be interested.
aluckyaday,the problem is these vegas books have not operated in the internet age where you are not taking bets one at a time from a queue of people. when you take thousand of bets a minute on hundreds of markets and bots can monitor markets much faster than humans...
aluckyaday,"the issue is taxation. pinnacle's model does not work in ""high"" tax jurisdictions their margins are too small. by high i mean just about any tax at all! pinnacle do not even operate in the uk. i would be surprised if they entered the us legally any time soon."
aluckyaday,without the numbers i'd be searching for a reason cognitive closure. need to drop irish racing maybe? but because i know i'm beating the closing line by about my average i know its just variance. this is why you should do the numbers  keeps you sane in the downturns
aluckyaday,an individual punter does not need to consider them to maximise their profits. they just need to detect when the trading price differs from the fair price. whereas a bookmaker can increase their profits if they can predict how the crowd will behave if the price deviates from fair
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  disagree with you. but we are a representative democracy not a direct one. hence why the referendum was only advisory. it does not and should not supersede parliament which was also democratically elected. how can it be democratic to go against the will of parliament?
aluckyaday,actually i believe lowering taxation and regulation are the real driving force behind brexit nothing to do with sovereignty and how it was sold. becoming a tax haven is one way the uk could try and compete with the eu. if you think public services services are bad now....
aluckyaday,the issue is whether those tcs are obvious fair or both. under uk law i believe unfair terms and conditions are allowed as long as they are obvious i.e. both parties are aware of the terms and agree with them. whether this is the case is the debatable bit.

GolcondaFund,admittedly ucf was no clemson but come on a team that can compete with the lsu's and auburn's of the world in a given year would make a playoff much more exciting undefeated than any team from big 12. #ucf beat that 1 loss baylor team too with bortles..

nonrandomalpha,unquestionably the sharpest money is on wall street + the last 3  years have been a bear massacre (in spite of fed raising rates). if politics guided your investing youd have been sheepishly sitting in cash as risk assets rocked n rolled 2 all time highs since election night

nonrandomalpha,rodgers had 1 mediocre but still decent give up on mccarthy and pout season + you extrapolate that hes past his prime? youre trigger happy on that call + its obviously premature. gb will be a formidable opponent this and almost every year that a-rod is on the team.
nonrandomalpha,the chiefs and giants both didn't win the super bowl last year. are you suggesting their seasons were as equally unsuccessful?  team a took a season to move in the right direction team b the wrong direction. sb or bust is not a fair assessment of a season's efficacy.

LeeSharpeNFL,"i guess the obvious reply to this is "" that is  exactly why you roll it out with the bengals! so it looks like  it is  clean!"" but i doubt belichick is being that next level about this. i'm certainly not going to assume that as my default position."
LeeSharpeNFL,"his words *imply* that jackson's success on those plays is due to the presumed confusion defenders will have due to his skin color rather that success being a result of his talents.

whether he meant to communicate that or not that is the likely take away from his words."

LockyLockerson,when the market model and the spread differed by 3 or more points that was a profitable bet last year.  that doesn't beat it will be profitable this year but just interesting to note.  last night the clippers was off by 3+ points (probably because of the george injury)
LockyLockerson,a little too early to say monday is tough because my preliminary work is done (since  it is  automated) but i haven't actually thought about each game yet.  asu really seems like a lay-up though in that i doubt i can come up with reasons not to play it.

DannyParkins,the majority of teams treat london like a regular game and go over later in the week like the bears. the raiders are on the west coast and got crushed in london last year so they switched it up and went early. please dont blame this ass-kicking on travel.
DannyParkins,if you have proof that this person didnt have that intention please share it. i hope he didnt seems unlikely. but if he did hell surely denounce the ban and declare his innocence so as to not be branded a racist and be allowed to return to wrigley right?
DannyParkins,in this case this is truly horrible advice unless coaching at alma mater is a dream job for bieniemy. theres no better apprenticeship towards being a head coach in the nfl than being andy reids oc. keep coaching mahomes and putting up numbers hell get a gig next year.

Gingfacekillah,this wouldn't be a play atm because its not a blowout and its too early to fire. but just keep updating when you see a game get away from a team 10+ points when its past the 10 minute mark in the 2nd half. you'll likely see some value.
Gingfacekillah,mem/hou hits nicely at 214. nice win. i suspect line makers were trying to take advantage of the low scoring perception of hou in the last month. had it capped at 225 +/- 18 points making 200.5 approx 1.49 st. dev's away from expected mean value.  #handicapping #nba #sharpaction
logan_matthews9,i havent done a breakdown of how the distribution of picks worked out. for me i didnt address gt until much later. when i finally did i did underestimate the amount of contrarian picks - last night in particular was surprising how many were on lsu and/or the over
logan_matthews9,"blanked in the outright and a very poor matchups showing but a great top ten pull kept this to just a small loss this week.

logan_matthews9,i didnt listen to the whole interview so ill plead some ignorance there but hes 17 and playing up a cycle i dont think he shouldve expected more than that. and theres a ton of reasons to hate on ussf but dual national recruitment cant be one of them
logan_matthews9,yet another line moving against prediction. not going to add a half unit yet but im not sure how people are seeing this getting in the 230s. they both play slow - 21st and 27th in pace - and theres not a lot of offensive talent on either team
PikachuBets,"also super lmao at ""care about teams or the sport."" yeah bc everyone knows the most objective takes on sports comes from those who care the most deeply about certain teams! not subjective at all. ofc that is what we are all missing. we are missing the teams! lololol."
PikachuBets,the fact that you can change it so quickly is just another red flag. you know you can just change it back again just as quickly when this twitter shitstorm tides over and go back to screwing people. messing up this highly imp legal tos is unforgivable. come on.

adamchernoff,but a good way to not convert and retain new customers is to have them intimidated by the stakes before even placing a bet. at the end of the day what this billion dollar company has created is a poorly designed sportsbar/restaurant with the ability to bet on sports.
adamchernoff,as a bit of pretext. in the past decade i have spent a lot of time in the produce space for gaming. from 2010-2015 with sportsbooks and 2015 - 2018 with slots electronic table games and lottery. i am not reverting back to sportsbook with a couple of projects.

adamchernoff,it is a rough drawing to explain the thought process but on my ratings that would be where the team is currently within the range they can play to (adjustments) not expensive or cheap. i just added an explanation with kc in the thread which i left out initially.

Ccon8181,refs showed their hand at the end of the 1st half. holding call on the long field goal attempt by the #pats just in case he made it to take them out of range. expect a few holding calls against #pats 2nd half. #bills really gonna get this cover?
ToddFuhrman,i think  it is  a great point.  my follow would be as machine learning and technology plays a greater role in game protection along with the required human element rooting this out still happens much faster in legal markets then if all the activity was happening in the shadows
12Xpert,"it is  this sort of ""journalism"" which makes it easy to label  a moral crusader. it might well be the case that big stakers are more likely to be addicts but  let us  see the data before passing implicitly moral judgements which encourage mps to shoot their mouths off."
12Xpert,indeed. that is the moral choice where this debate leads us. traditionally the us bookmaking industry has taken the view that it is a matter of honour to accept action from everyone who asks for it.  it is  different in europe. the european model is now infecting the us.
12Xpert,it might be the case. but it could also be that the bookmaker sets -7 knowing it should be -5 the sharp exploits it telling the bookmaker that line is really -7 but they also know that the squares will disproportionately keep betting -5 because they suffer psychological bias.
12Xpert,"it critical for a healthy uk democracy which has been absent since 2015. and  it is  always about ""the economy stupid."" to achieve liberal progressive green goals you have to credibly show how you will pay for them and bring everyone with you who will be asked to contribute."
12Xpert,he's still got an account because william hill expect him to hand it all back and more. in the end they expect the variance to kill him. here's just the second run of a simulation with 250 10-bet parlays odds 20 each parlay with +20 percent  xroi stakes $10000.
12Xpert,im not asking him to admit its pants. im not even arguing that it is pants. im asking how he knows its not and all hes come up with so far is its only profit that matters. that position needs calling out so others dont make the same mistake.
12Xpert,you must have more than one link to different results then. i could have 100 links to 100 different sets of results and 25 of them would be better than the picture i just posted. i could should boom for those 25 and say nothing about the other 75.
12Xpert,at least 35 percent  of the voting public definitely voted for wto brexit if the euro elections are anything to go by.  that is  about 2/3 of those who voted brexit. i think the idea that people didn't know what they were voting for has been put to bed.
12Xpert,for sure but for a bet to happen between two parties in the first place both have to think they are more right than the other.  that is  impossible. so either one or both are irrational (they want to lose assets) or more likely they are suffering overconfidence bias.
12Xpert,really no point at making an official complaint to the  because whilst they will agree with me then ask the offender to stop and then tell me that they have been assured they will stop the respondent will then carry on as normal. thats how this thing works right?
12Xpert,in financial investing you can study the way prices move in an attempt to predict what happens next (technical analysis charting) or you can study fundamentals like what is a company doing to get an idea of what their stock might be worth in the future. same with betting.
12Xpert,"i  daily fantasy sports  believe his ""inefficiency"" is real. the sample size is too small. i've given you samples in the thousands with big profits to closing pinny prices never mind junk bookies that are totally worthless. betaminic has given you samples of 5-figures that are all worthless too"

mschwimer,this is a correct statement as well. but i could say the same thing about subs that bet 100 per game and how much more profitable. we have been consistent and only judge our record on our recommended $300 per unit. key is consistency and not picking and choosing.
mschwimer,"monster week for jambos.  especially in ! 

we are posting a lot of our ncaa football picks today before noon et.  if you want to see them sign up at  and get the 1 or 4 week package. must sign up today to be eligible for the weekly guarantee."
mschwimer,i have lots of thoughts and am extremely confident you will understand this. but twitter simply the worst platform. i have invited rufus to join my podcast. or i can join his. which ever he prefers. but its a fascinating convo. fyi. the gambling world unanimously agrees with rufus
mschwimer,extremely hard to explain in 280 characters. sports bettors think everything revolves around closing line value. so if you put a play in at -3 and it goes to -4 they think its a good bet. i disagree. i think it matters slightly but other things matter way more.
mschwimer,"great question! our current models do seem to be heavy on dogs. a lot of it is seasonal. 

as our models improve and the season progresses i believe we should start to see more favorites being recommended. cant imagine a scenario where we recommend those more than dogs though."
mschwimer,not a fan of any of the teams in question. pure math here. georgia should be the 3 seed in the football playoff.  the spread in a clemson/georgia game would be around 3. instead clemson/notre dame is 11.5. committee making emotional decisions that are not supported by math imo.
RufusPeabody,"if you're listing pitchers which any bettor with a pulse should be doing a starting pitching change makes a bet ""no action"". if you're not listing pitchers then you're at the mercy of the book and get action at the first price they hang after the pitching change."
SportsCheetah,massive deal in a pro-style offense. you have to credit day for scheming something that better suits him but  it is  also not the first time a qb has improved after his freshman season so fields deserves credit for getting more comfortable in the pocket/patience. always had tools.
SportsCheetah,then why was utah ranked ahead of them in this past ranking? they're both going to add a top-30 win. for whatever reason they haven't given b12 respect to this point not sure why it would change much upon both winning conf title and adding another quality win.
SportsCheetah,its going to depend a lot on who the replacement minutes are getting taken up by too. a guy like kawhi you may think is a big loss on the defensive end but the players taking minutes like pg13/bev/harkless etc. are pretty dang good replacements on that front.
SportsCheetah,anyway so far this season minnesota is taking their shots at the rim or from 3 at the third-highest frequency in the league (78.3 percent ). for context houston was at 82 percent  last season. the difference between how ryan saunders and tom thibodeau approach basketball is stark.
SportsCheetah,not quite but also only slightly worse than anthony davis. drtg 82nd percentile. the offense will take a hit imo and not sure when the numbers say bagley was your worst defender that more bagley at center is going to be better overall. rim protection only a piece.
SportsCheetah,mem o26.5 -125 - one of the bigger inefficiencies in the nba rsw market the last few years has been projecting tankapalooza. it will be interesting to see how/if things change much with the new lottery odds going forward but regardless the market has sharpened up some there...

tn wants to cap the amount that operators can pay out to winning bettors at 85 percent . this infers a 15 percent  hold. as comparison -110/-110 is 4.5 percent  hold. gonna be some bad lines in tn if this takes effect."
capjack2000,"let us  put it this way it'll only go up from here. 

oregon lottery needs to do about $25m per month in handle just to break even. they should be able to do twice that once they mature. if not makes a strong case for allowing college betting."
capjack2000,"the bigger issue is that it either represents panic or incompetence by  

panic that too many people have ne and already received $1600 back from their $2000 wager?

or incompetence offering too good of a promo in the 1st place.

capjack2000,tribal gaming can only be taxed if tribal casinos can offer something non-tribal casinos can not. so the seminoles will broker a deal where only they can offer sportsbetting. they'll give the racinos table games in exchange.  it is  possible they'll have a monopoly on sports in fl.

capjack2000,kambi is the b2b risk manager that rivers uses. they take a heavy handed approach to anyone who might resemble a skilled bettor. if you bet those derivatives or props they're going to assume you know what you're doing decrease the amount you can bet to peanuts. example:
capjack2000,"you may be right but almost every new igt machine has some sort of ap vulnerability. they could eliminate the vultures if state of play ends with the current player.

capjack2000,"the point being - there is an inverse relationship between the size of the audience and how in-depth you can go on a topic. this event gives the opportunity to get to know the person instead of the persona.

capjack2000,i will still heap accolades on the first software that allows you to turn off certain forms of gambling. if were going to let draftkings be a casino then let people turn off the casino feature if they dont want to be tempted to chase their sports loss.
dinkinc,2/2 have value because of the rotation that they use... use common sense to see if there is a logical reason for this...calgary rarely wins in anaheim..i dont want to use a trend that doesn't involve players who are in today's linup..most trends are nonsense based on variance

robpizzola,yes staying home to give out candy to children every year when i will never have children of my own is really a shitty thing to do. meanwhile theres blowhards turning their lights off and watching tv in the basement cursing to themselves every time the doorbell rings.
robpizzola,a team with an 18.15 percent  implied win probability won a game yesterday. why does it matter whether it was an august baseball game or an october baseball game or a january ballet competition? probability is probability.     we  daily fantasy sports  get to arbitrarily choose where it applies.
RASPicks,how in the world would you know why anyone does or doesn't do something or that you know better than them about what they should be doing? everyone on that list markets themselves for a reason at least with pick sellers that reason is out in the open.
RASPicks,firstly we've had significant success for a very long time so the reputation is warranted.  that is how closing line value is supposed to work.  second there are still plenty of other influential bettors in the nflx market that can correct line mistakes if they believe one exists.
suuma810,personally i won't adjust my numbers until after week 4 if not for a qb change. that being said i might just manually set the fins to 2 wins because my model cannot quantify such a mess lol.  daily fantasy sports  know what's going on in south beach.
ClevTA,thats such a garbage argument. the only way that makes sense is if any mlb team could only win with homegrown stars. its actually the opposite. wonder how was nationals fans are when harper leaves  they immediately win a world series. the asset is actually  one single star
ClevTA,i enjoy waking up to a timeline of people arguing who they think should be ranked 1 or 2 when all that matters is trying to predict what a random group of strangers will do based on arbitrary metrics. i mean nobody cares about twitter eggs power ratings

ClevTA,browns were -3 at home v buf. browns were -3 at home v pit. they are even teams in the market. pit gets 3 and maybe 3.5 for hfa. depending on injuries in the next month this will be the line. trust me i know how this works
CizzlingSports,"""consensus"" line for release purposes should mean wa. nd -17.5 was not wa. bm/cris closer is fair enough representation of market at post. but that doesnt mean bm/cris line at release was wa. if you're not releasing wa lines you're not ""changing the game."" just more tout tricks"

they autocopy instead of automove.

spanky,lots of great ideas come while either lying in bed or sitting on the toilet.  the power of silence to gather and organize thoughts is incredible.  its important to write ideas down when they hit you. theres always a pen and pad beside my bed and toilet. #realworldadvice
spanky,just ran into jeff gural who complimented me calling william hill and joe asher out at the conference for kicking out sharps. he then told me he asked fanduel if they book me and said if they didnt he was gonna make sure they did!  coolest billionaire ever!
spanky,my point was using a bot can not change the price the bookmaker is offering.  if the bookmaker decides to adjust his price after a flood of bets come in that is his prerogative.  bookmaking at its core should be to hang a number to take a hit...
spanky,i 100 percent  do not originate all my bets.  does that make me less of a sports bettor?  does it make all the money i've made betting less greener?  our strengths are technologyinformationreputationand outs.  very little happens in these us markets without me being aware of it. (1/2)

PlusEVAnalytics,if theres no parimutuel license shouldnt the books either take these as fixed-odds bets and set limits accordingly or at least make a good faith effort to not take bets that they wont pay out fully based on the live odds at the time the bet is made?
aluckyaday,"this is the crux. worldwide bookmaking has changed. america was left behind because of its protective practices. now it has opened up market forces take over. the ""european"" model is the most profitable way to run a book. american pros have to adapt like the european ones have"
aluckyaday,you are missing the point of recreational betting. the value of the product is nothing to do with ev. it is the enjoyment they get from the chemical changes in their brain. how do you put a price on that other than what people are willing to pay?
aluckyaday,they are guaranteed a long term profit on average. it does not mean individual runners are priced correctly. those pricing errors just cancel out across the market. some are too long and some are too short. if what you are saying is true no one could ever win.
aluckyaday,ok that staking method is not kelly. in theory i should be staking more than level returns on the accas because of the gearing of the edge but its halfway there staking based on the price. i'll try kelly staking based on an assumed edge at some point.
aluckyaday,i would think the problem with bm in the online era is they are not going to get the huge recreational volume. trips to the casino for recreational players are a special occasion unlike online where they are going to place a bet on every game they watch.
aluckyaday,you can mitigate the risk of bigger price bets by staking correctly. value is value  whatever the price. if you are betting for entertainment then your strategy is fine the utility of a winner is important but for maximum profit bigger value can be found at bigger prices
aluckyaday,these kind of promos are normal in the uk. although if you are a restricted punter you are not allowed to participate. they work out quite cheap when compared to other methods of advertising/customer retention. european softs know what they are doing and are very good at it!
aluckyaday,i thought normal practice was to start work and then you have so long to apply for a licence. is that because you need a work permit so would need a licence before applying? or that you/the books wont take the risk that you might not get one?
aluckyaday,thinking about it the calculator requires level stakes. i'm guessing that is unlikely if laying unless you are laying to lose a fixed amount. you could replace the yield standard deviation calculation in f7 with the sd of your actual returns. i think it would then work ok.
aluckyaday,i guess it really depends what you are looking for. i wrongly assumed they were consensus closing lines. i was looking at line changes between opening and what i thought was close. i was rather annoyed with myself when i found out that is not what they were!
aluckyaday,"they may not be a real bookmaker in the traditional sense of the word but they are experts (like all the european operators) of maximizing their profits from recreational punters. as the us opens up i think the ""real books"" will struggle to compete with their marketing machines."
aluckyaday,still can't beat the physics. energy is required to move a weigh. horses have limited energy stored. carrying the weight means energy is used up quicker. for 2 horses of equal efficiency and equal energy stored the one carrying more weight will stop first!  that is  the effect...
theFirmAISports,haha im not sure if you know but they are 3-0 in the preseason! that means theyll for sure make the playoffs this year! haha but realistically 6 wins would be a good season for them with that group. my model needs some manual adjustment for their disfunction..
joeytunes2,we really try and make these rankings interesting. but its the same 3 teams and another sec team. all interchangeable. it can only be one of 7 8 teams every year. its less interesting as the years go on. im all for 8 teams. which will happen soon.
EdMillerPoker,"the winners in us sports betting will be the ones who best combine the lessons learned in the last 15 years of the european industry with the lessons learned in the last 15 years of american sports betting.

to me this seems so obviously true its almost tautology."
EdMillerPoker,yes thank you for bringing it to my attn. the zillion markets thing is so much the wrong idea for operators.. increases attack surface by a lot with tons of poorly priced garbage. a handful of contextually interesting (and varied) markets per game is such a better concept.
EdMillerPoker,i complain about how media business models work these days but one thing its great at is determining what things are interesting to people. why not spend some time looking at sports media see which ways of looking at sports capture attention and then build products around that.
GolcondaFund,"unpopular handicap by most bettors - this is why i stopped betting horse races. they have 0 say in their treatment and a broken leg is a death sentence. imagine if we put patrick mahomes down after a banged up knee...

nonrandomalpha,if we want to be precise it was 18 yards from the 20 to the 38 but you're intellectually dishonest and want to err on the side of whatever makes your point stronger so you continually round down; first only 10 now 15 when if rounding easily 20.
nonrandomalpha,listen im not gonna go on and on about this. i think they provide valuable content which is free...if you want to buy their picks have at it. who cares? target the source with your energy; the people who buy picks and attempt to reform their degenerate behavior
nonrandomalpha,aggressiveness out of desperation tho. if just one of those fails the gators dont convert drive into score and lose this outright. the mental breakdowns throughout the game were pure reflections of poor coaching and should have been lethal - but the miami ol is just that bad.
LeeSharpeNFL,"most recent years this award goes to someone whose record exceeded expectations instead of properly awarding it to bill belichick.

LeeSharpeNFL,"possible but i would say unlikely.

JoeyKnish22,yeah im not gonna recommend somebody i think would stiff. never had a payout issue ppl i know there have never had a payout issue. the full disclosure issues ive heard were the pika friend vpn issue and he juices player props. other than that standard metallic skin.
JoeyKnish22,i saw that one. i much prefer these. theres a lot more randomness in the language with that since burrow is gonna get the vast majority of 1st place votes. only gonna be a handful of non burrow first place votes so it was a pass for me.
JoeyKnish22,found myself in exact same position. was talking with a buddy who had just cancelled and said i literally never find myself on the app was paying for a service i didnt use. or maybe 1-2 articles a month i skimmed after seeing a tweet. not worth it.
JoeyKnish22,missed this when it dropped but was a great read. in my younger days i used to not take the swings all to well lol. the toll capping screen time game watching spreadsheet analyzing etc...can take on your mental health when youre grinding is pretty significant at times.
TheKostos,legit think the judge hire is either going to be an unmitigated disaster or a roaring success. one of the two. and i'm fine with the gamble. i actually like the hire more than i thought i would. much happier now than i was an hour ago. #allrise
LockyLockerson,"i swore off nba mvp betting last year because with the new awards time being mid-summer  it is  just an insanely long time to wait for what is generally a small price/payout.

but since everyone's betting ben simmons apparently here are some thoughts on the mvp this year:"
LockyLockerson,michigan may lose saturday but it won't be because of those nonsense harbaugh trends y'all are quoting.  like yeah...sorry he couldn't beat urban meyer #2 penn state on the road and #5 wisconsin on the road 2 seasons ago.  what a loser.  can't believe he couldn't beat them.
DannyParkins,before calling them hypocrites ask what youre doing to free hong kong? probably nothing. what are you doing for any social cause? probably something. but youre not trying to solve them all? just the ones closest to your heart where you can make the biggest impact. (the end)
DannyParkins,kevin durant deserves all the credit in the world but lets not act like he put his payday on the line. even if its worst case scenario and he tore his achilles he could still get a max contract a 1 and 1 or whatever he wants because...
DannyParkins,i'm not deciding what is or isn't good for anyone as a whole. i said  it is  not my word or place. i'm saying baseball could do itself a service by listening to tim anderson's perspective. i respect her opinion but know plenty of black people who disagree.
chadmillman,"this is consistently some of the most interesting work  does ... and he does a lot of interesting work. 

1.  it is  a lesson for people who  daily fantasy sports  bet. 

2.  it is  an entirely different way to assess games. 

3.  it is  prescriptive for regular bettors."
Gingfacekillah,adam these personal attacks are getting sad. i wrote a book to help bettors. i left your discord channel because i dont like the way you talk to people. sorry if either of those things hurt your feelings but try not to engage in libel. youre embarrassing yourself.
Gingfacekillah,parity creates games and leagues that are more subject to the whims of random variance. many sports fans at least over here prefer to watch games where anything is possible rather than a match or a season that is likely a foregone conclusion. the any given sunday philosophy
Gingfacekillah,"i calculate the variance for each bet as (1^2*(decimal odds -1)). then i sum this variance for all bets. next find the sq of this variance to find the s touchdown . dev. then i take:

((total profit/dollars per unit)/ standard deviation) = z score.

finally: 1-normsdist(z score)"
logan_matthews9,"so i want to follow up on this for a second: the quick answer is no - there is no publicly available shot/pbp data 

and this is so unfortunate for the development of advanced analytics in the soccer world. companies holding it hostage are ultimately short-changing the sport"
logan_matthews9,"also got morikawa at 41 and 2.4 at t20. would take t10 down to 3.75 t5 to 6. might hit something else but waiting for full release for everywhere.

not too much else i'm interested in for the tx. fowler seems underpriced but got him in some matchups"
logan_matthews9,the weather for the second hawaii tournament is as expected nuts. likely even worse than sentry which mostly avoided the predicted storms but was still subject to heavy wind. rain in the forecast for fri-sun with constant 15+ miles per hour winds and thursday will be much higher
logan_matthews9,the only adjustment i made was giving less weight to past performances on the course. probably why im not as high on xander rahm and woodland. also noteworthy even not giving that as much weight dj is still my favorite (who has played this course very well historically)
logan_matthews9,it definitely is. a trade exception is the same thing as having the salary on the books - it normally doesnt matter because teams are often over the cap so its irrelevant. they have to renounce all their fas to sign kemba at which point sts arent possible
PikachuBets,"ok. v2: you're hiding behind legal protections. you waive all legal liability mandate an arbitration process thru your arbitrator limit damages to $5k not $10k. this is why you'll only use your website. this is why nobody will buy 100 subs to ""short"" you. you can respond now."
PikachuBets,/4 yes they should know better. yes they shouldn't be so gullible. no that doesn't mean we should sit idly when someone like berry explodes onto the scene. it doesn't mean we allow a guy to mislead/fudge public records to garner attention  do pr blitzes. no. fuck that.
PikachuBets,hi scot big fan you are work. do you only ever track/share/brag about your record when you go on a heater? does that mean you'll kill it this winter? a groundhog told me  it is  supposed to be cold which model from p.c. richards do you recommend? tytyt6969tyty
PikachuBets,being srs for once. gambling depression is too real. no level of sharpness can shield one from the darkness of losing the awful stomach lurches the nagging whispers of doubt. money can be earned back but lost life cant. dont live this life alone. find your way friends.
PikachuBets,my conclusion is fuck the old fucks who think they get to shit on young ppl. thats all i wanted to rant about. im just on twitter to bet on sports not about to do sociological theory with yall or submit some labor econ abstract. great discussions though!
adamchernoff,i know the jets are the greatest franchise in professional football but even andy dalton would be surprised to see obnoxious amount of love the bengals are getting after putting up 4.4 yards per play last sunday. now down through the keys of 10 and 7 to 6.5...
adamchernoff,should think about handicapping the game six different times with each team playing the majority in a specific game state. why this total is interesting is because hou despite likely having a lead changes their play calling balance less than any team in the nfl (3 percent  diff)...
adamchernoff,we are now talking about things that have nothing to do with the original point of extra margin priced into all futures markets. so for the sake of the batteries on the other 7 people tagged in this thread we should carry on with our day. good luck
adamchernoff,tough call. but we are not likely to see pi overturned very often this year especially in meaningful spots. its a new judgement call made ontop of a missed judgement call and over turning a call requires the ref to openly admit he/crew made a poor judgement initially.
adamchernoff,you can never know for sure how margins are distributed by books but in nfl on key numbers anytime there is a noticeable difference between spread and moneyline equivalent by removing the vig different ways you can often work back to the same base opening price between games.
adamchernoff,as you can see the expected value using market odds for a bet on japan is -4.20 percent . if you were to make this bet every time at the same odds you would expect to lose $4.20 for every $100 staked. (removing vig is for another day/thread).
adamchernoff,"four matches in a row peru has been bet down heavily. with so much crossover between the 2018 wc and this #copaamerica it is fair to say this is the fifth match the team has been bet down in a row. results will finally come. 

tactical breakdown here:"
adamchernoff,"the simple handicap for november 30th is now up and live. i have added two more bets to my sunday card to go along with new england -5. start your friday morning off right with the wagers and a quick breakdown of the week 13 market. 

listen below:"
Ccon8181,another push ... #bears -2 -110. feels like a loss with #bears allowing only touchdown of the game on final drive with 3 minutes left. i know the casual bettors hate to hear it but thats the importance of getting the right number. closed at -3. still disappointing.
Ccon8181,valid points david but the issue is the inconsistency. there have been high profile games (utah/duke ncaa tourney)where the refs went to the monitor and determined a foul called at the buzzer actually took place .4 sec before and pulled the teams from locker room to shoot fts
Ccon8181,should be better at this point in the season no doubt. lifetime over 55 percent  winners. i bet real $ unfortunately against sharp lines - bc they are the only ones who will book my action. but this is going to be a solid year i know it.
ToddFuhrman,"osu -26 vs. fau
nebraska -32.5 vs. south alabama 
ncsu -20 vs. ecu
iu -17 vs. ball state 
uk -13 vs. toledo 
memphis -6 vs. ole miss
bama -30.5 vs. duke 
stanford -6.5 vs. northwestern 
vt -2 at bc
south carolina -7.5 vs. unc
fsu -3.5 vs. boise"
12Xpert,this actually isn't news anymore rather i imagine the times have joined the  in an anti gambling moral crusade. bets are always consensual and if one side refuses to take action from another  that is  their right no matter how annoying it might seem to a skilled punter.
12Xpert,i think it came out of the financial crash and brexit and trump came out of that. when people stop believing what they have been told because what they were told seems to them to be a crock shit then they will believe in anything that seems better.
12Xpert,none of these twitter tipsters will be profitable because of skill. they will all be lucky. its just variance. much easier to be more heavily profitable in a high variance market. also much easier to be loss making. but those disappear from sight or just delete old records.
12Xpert,3) if you're not good enough to beat a sharp book then and get banned from soft books consider that they are saving you livelihood because they would only let you continue if you were a loser. in which case i've done you a favour getting you banned.
12Xpert,or rather i should say for the reason that is the basis of this silly conspiracy attacking the bbc because their narrative doesn't suit those who are anti johnson in the same way that the right endlessly criticise the bbc for a left bias.  it is  all pathetic.
12Xpert,"if we knew what the 50-50 goal line was then we could compare that to actual goal difference. that would work but unfortunately we dont know what that goal line is since bookmakers only offer handicaps in quarters.
could a 50-50 line work as a new betting concept?"
12Xpert,if it wasn't very original shame you didn't think of it and make a load of money selling it like  and  i  daily fantasy sports  doubt there were others who thought of this privately but to my knowledge no one published it. hence i'll take the credit thanks.
12Xpert,certainly germany does. but endless cycles of economic hardship in mediterranean countries will take its toll in the end. the only realistic way to mitigate against that is to make europe a single country with all the distribution of wealth from rich to poor that goes with it
12Xpert,that is  certainly true. but if in the end neither of them are as good as the pinny implied predictions at market closure what's the point of them? no goo for making money. what else might they be good for? page filler for  certainly. is there anything else?

mschwimer,interesting note.  would love to have vegas dave or any other awful tout on his show. he would absolutely destroy them (i would love to listen as it would be incredible).  but when i ask to have a conversation on the podcast he doesnt respond. why is that?
mschwimer,in order for us to make the guarantees we are making we need sample size. the more games we recommend the less likely we are to lose. which is why we combine all sports in our packages. however we will look into sports specific packages as we progress.
mschwimer,"short answer. no. happy to win 3 best bets in a row though!

reminder. our best sport will be football. our basketball stuff was great. mlb should be able to beat the market but by a lot less than the other sports. all according to our internal analysis."
RufusPeabody,there are lots of bettors out there that care about this  have a lot of industry knowledge but most  daily fantasy sports  have the time or patience to read through all these bills. we won't see changes unless legislators understand our perspective and what matters to bettors.
RufusPeabody,jambos uses a 1 play = 1 unit system. units can be easily manipulated by a tout to show a winning record whether  it is  unit inflation if they're down or an old fashioned martingale system. if 1 play = 1 unit  that is  not possible. (2/x)
jeffma,huh? you said the game strategy would be to make the first and miss the second... so to get this straight because he shoots 52 percent  he gets to choose which one he makes and which one he misses? just trying to understand what you are saying
SportsCheetah,also a lesson to never let fat bearded men from the internet lay -200 that they can shoot 30 percent + on stand still nba 3s. when an elite shooter hits 40 percent + in games against the greatest athletes in the world its a little different.
SportsCheetah,"week 4 moneyline rr is usually the last one i bet. fewer games in non-conference play + early-season (positive) uncertainty/randomness/variance no longer a factor. gl.

pitt +296 (narduzzi for sure wins tomo if i left them off)

capjack2000,a lot of operators seem to be fixed on profit margin percentage. however if they booked more action their actual profits would increase even if margins went down. with most of their expenses being fixed costs anyway that seems like a logical growth strategy against high taxes.
capjack2000,"won't be touched headed into a major election year. next real window is 2023. however what could congress do that would remedy this situation? 

the key imo is public perception. if the public sees the glass ceiling they will pressure sportsbooks into giving them a fair play."
capjack2000,"i wake up each day and go over my betting options for that day. for the past few days ive been in nv and it doesnt take long. 

nv needs to discover the wonderful world of market derivatives. betting just a side or total is so 2000-and-late."
capjack2000,"sad to hear of the death of recent ocean resort owner bruce deifik today. deifik built the nicest sportsbook in nj in hopes that it would be the centerpiece of his property. 

unfortunately his reign in ac was brief and unprofitable. hopefully some secrets die with him."
capjack2000,"first point yes.

second point no. wh chose to stay at 3 -110 on the sb despite the landslide of ne money. they were ok taking liability because they only have a 16 percent  equity stake. they profited nationwide on the game. ri loss was a joke."
capjack2000,the refunds on bad beats doesn't cost them much because there's likely not a lot of wagers on those instances. however they must have investors who are ok with not showing a profit immediately. they're definitely playing a long game here of building player loyalty via givebacks.
dinkinc,my old stomping gounds...i was there opening night...  daily fantasy sports  look up the date... owned my first horse there.. cashed a then record high 31k trifecta... spent hours on the cross bronx expressway getting there... saw bonnie raitt in a pre-race concert with about 20 people..memories
dinkinc,i like under .... think both teams won't opt for conservative starts...the pack because of the respect for the niner defense and the niners because of last weeks passing struggles...the market disagrees with me and leans to the pack.. are you involved in wagers ? guessing yes
dinkinc,i really was being sarcastic... but i am sure this will come up soon... one.. i dont think kindly of a god that would bless certain countries... two.. in trumperica we know who he fake considers as our god..the one that would get him the most votes
dinkinc,"he lost his friend... not easy for him either.... wanting everyone to wear a poppy is ridiculous... but the poppy is a positive thing.. we have a guy who calls athletes "" sons of bitches "" if they do something that he wrongly thinks dishonors veterans .."
dinkinc,yes but more so in football...a basketball coach has to adjust to the styles of his best players... a football coach can make his best players adjust to his style... i know  really uses coaches to determine his total bias at the start of the fb season
dinkinc,there is a time and a place for guerrilla warfare matches. while i respect what jenela and allin do having those matches  without them ending a feud is bad for business. no one says necro butcher is their favorite wrestler.  has always been about great wrestling matches
robpizzola,dubnyk back koivu close to returning to the lineup as well. zucker long-term injury hurts a lot though. i have them ranked 19th in my current ratings... i can see them sneaking into the playoffs which could open some hedge possibilities but not much more than that.
suuma810,#browns futures have seen a lot of action since january. it might not be the worst idea to wait until the regular season to get involved. their schedule in weeks 1-9 is a bit severe at first glance. 5/8 on the road home games vs lar  sea.
suuma810,home teams who trail after the third quarter win 56.8 percent  in overtime (113-86-4). overall  it is  53.7 percent  (200-174-11). that means 54 percent  is a good starting point and this even makes it more of a right decision for the trailing team to go for 2.
suuma810,"patriots -10 
dolphins +6  
jaguars +3 
ravens -2.5 
jets -2.5 
rams over 49 
cardinals +4.5 

4-3 so far and juice loss with a buy-back on the gb/det total.

dolphins +6 entering the 4th quarter 17-3 was one of the tougher beats in a while but thats variance"
suuma810,took bears -3 with the opener my line was -7.5. bears the much better team overall. pc  schotty are bad. the pick-six helped but sea also had a garbage time  touchdown . disappointed by trubisky expected much more from that offense. will downgrade a bit going forward.
ClevTA,this has been happening all season its not an isolated event. the end of first half against seattle cost them that game as well. hes as bad a situational coach as ive ever seen in the nfl. and that includes bad ones like vance joseph  anthony lynn
ClevTA,so let me get this straight withers would rather have a system where home grown guys stuck around but teams lose rather than trade for tons of assets  win? thats where the disconnect is here. a system cant be broken if u can win w/out homegrown stars.
ClevTA,only? so its not the never addressing by far the biggest weakness at ol even with tons of assets  after overpaying first hubbard? or consistently ignoring character  trading up for a guy like callaway? or completely whiffing on multiple top 3 round picks? theres a lot here
CizzlingSports,"your t'sc's also exclude a mandatory prevailing party fees and costs provision.

spanky,"years ago i would find out when each offshore shop was having their christmas party so i can plan to attack their lines which were either unmanned or manned by a very inexperienced lines manager.  

i was ruthless back then looking for every edge i could find."
spanky,"thanks to   and many others who helped give me advice and help on the  podcast world. 

this is all very new to me. 

thanks to all the initial feedback both positive and negative.

im just trying to be as real as i can be and get better."
spanky,"this  refunding losing bets imo will hurt long term more than help.  

there will be worse bad beats than ones already refunded that they wont refund and then what?

best to deal a good product from the get-go instead of treating a losing bettor like a child."
spanky,there are no buyers. he didnt sell picks. he bet more than anyone. he had the most to gain and the most to lose. a gun wasnt put to anyones head demanding a betting partnership. just like in every form of business buyer beware. this is gambling.
spanky,"very few people ever publicly encourage others to bet offshore despite every pro doing so. this could potentially hurt their future in any regulated environment

i on the other hand tell it like it is.  offshore shops like  are second to none. no promo code from me"
spanky,my guy in vegas several years ago lasted 3 weeks before he was cut down. i could bombard these places with runners and post 25 more videos.   but whats that gonna do? im trying to address the problem at the root.  still searching for a real bookmaker.
spanky,i'll never be a tout.  i take money from bookmakers not my fellow bettors. i came on twitter to try and change the landscape of regulated bookmaking in america.  i find myself answering dms to help others.  so i tweet my answers rather than do it individually.
spanky,if im reading between the lines svp was a big gambler before radio/tv.  he lost enough and possibly was able to turn it around.  he probably has the most experience gambling when compared to other media personalities.   he embraces sports gambling and i commend him for that.
spanky,(1/2)heres my opinion on fanduel error.the bettor should definitely not be paid on bad odds. the bettor should also not be paid based on what fanduel says the correct odds should be. setting correct odds after a game is graded is too subjective and violates bettor protection
aluckyaday,difficult question. from a personal prospective if i took jambos offer and chose not to back any of their selections i would consider it a bet that they would lose money across their selections. but from a legal prospective did they offer me a bet? probable not.
aluckyaday,"maybe ""winning bettors"" needs to be added to the list of protected characteristics of the equality act . the main issue here is the lack of understanding of restrictions and their purpose. are people promoting this doing it for selfish reasons or the benefit of all bettors?"
aluckyaday,i think you do have to register but the jambos thing has been all over twitter for a while. claiming to be a fair tout  with their money back guaranteee. lots of comment about their related selections and staking. teasing through zero raised an eyebrow or two
aluckyaday,maybe they have and know taxation like that makes it very unattractive to sharps impossible to win without luck. so the won't have to limit players stakes as all they will have is recreationals. if you like a big bet come to oregon we wont restrict you!
aluckyaday,they do but not sure how you determine what is an acceptable level of gambling debt many would say zero so blocking credit gambling all together would be a solution. but would that  affect responsible gamblers too much. and you still have the issue of cash withdrawals/transfers
aluckyaday,not removing it does too. and if you are doing it for rufuses reasons there is no guarantee you could have got on at the close. a guess another issue is how do you determine the close. does pinnacle define it. is it available through the api?
aluckyaday,in europe it is the soft books that now dominate. it was not always that way but as soon as one adopted that model the others followed pretty quickly. my take from that its not even close between which model is more profitable in the internet era!
aluckyaday,"they are but their is not a single market. there are several different prices depending on the market place. because there is not free movement of money across these markets and the terms/regulations of each market are different i think the concept of ""the market"" is flawed"
aluckyaday,an exchange for only 2 way bet where you could see the full order book and who had placed the orders would be interesting.  where you can select which order to match. a place where sharps can compete against each other to show they are the best.
aluckyaday,it is not a case of not being able to manage their risk effectively. they are managing their risk in a way that increases their profits. they are an entertainment company not a sharp bookmaker. increased profits means increased tax revenue so regulators are unlikely to act.
aluckyaday,but... if you have a model that is close to theirs you may be able detect when the books move away from what their sports model thinks is the fair price because their client/market models tell them they can make profit by being off the true price.

EdMillerPoker,"i always felt like people complaining about the ""scripting"" were mostly at the core complaining about how unfair and poorly designed the game itself was... that it pretended to be a game of projecting players and really it was a game of lineup construction and game theory."
EdMillerPoker,"then you need to build datasets which is not trivial. baseball has some decent datasets like retrosheet more readily available to start with. 

there's a book called ""analyzing baseball data with r"" that i haven't read but i've heard is good and seems like a reasonable shot."
EdMillerPoker,man to be honest i'm not sure. i use the python suite of data stuff but r also works. i think you'd want like the basics of data science/analtyics/machine learning stuff but then i think the most important skills are basically logical/critical thinking skills and sport knowledge
EdMillerPoker,main purpose of that sentence is to temper expectations. i  daily fantasy sports  want ppl reading the book and thinking they're going to get rich and underestimating how much extra work you have to do (and do well). i think  it is  much easier to be break-evenish.

GolcondaFund,"it is the inverse.

contests like gpp in fantasy or tournaments in poker actually favor the sharpest players over time. yes novices can win a given year or contest but it is inevitably about playing position like a poker tournament. but i agree shouldn't bet contest picks."
nonrandomalpha,broncos has *square sharp* written all over it. those picking denver are way too casual and smug about it. where were this purported sharps earlier this season on broncos? bettors abandoning ship on chiefs selling at the bottom of the market buying broncos off 2 lifeless wins.
nonrandomalpha,"key points to remember when thinking about putting your $ on the #cardinals early in the 2019 season:

cb1 patrick peterson: suspended for the first 6 games 

cb2 robert alford: broken leg and is expected out at least 6-8 games

this leaves rookie cb byron murphy vulnerable"
nonrandomalpha,very bullish tyler boyd. been pounding the table on him all offseason. i believe his emergence is one of the primary drivers of why greens injury didnt meaningful move the #bengals futures price - bc boyd is already the de facto no 1 wr on this team.
LeeSharpeNFL,"hmm interesting thought. i can see that as the amount of minor injuries should increase as the season goes on so the rest could be more valuable later?

LeeSharpeNFL,"""i mean you didn't have some questions for your algorithm when it said take the over on miami and the under on the pats?""

you called out both but fair. expecting some regression is reasonable. i still think it was a +ev bet just didn't work out."
LeeSharpeNFL,"many times i want 2 rows/game instead of just 1. for some reason i never took the time to actually functionalize this just kept redoing it.

well now i've fixed that. if you're like me and would find this useful  it is  now in my plays-functions.r file:"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  know if i agree with this the amount of variance in the nfl is huge.

if you took any 53 players you want off practice squads and played 100 games vs. bengals i'd expect you to win at least 25 games or so."
LeeSharpeNFL,"the rams:

- are committed to goff through 2021
- have no 2020 first round draft pick
- have no 2021 first round draft pick
- will not make the playoffs this year
- just lowered their win probability by kicking a field goal while down 21-3."
LeeSharpeNFL,to be fair in the legion of boom era it did seem like part of seattle's defensive strategy was to actively push the limit in terms of what they could get away with in terms of defensive penalties (though that only contributes to the x-axis of course).
whale_capper,"going to dive into this more on the podcast when we get to sea because i think their coaching puts them in more ""close game"" situations then they ought to be in and  that is  what's driving this phenomenon not that they are average and get lucky"
AndyMSFW,"golf! 
r1 stuff went 3-4 full tourney is 2-2 so far.  down around a half a unit so this is my moving day bounce-back effort!
tringale over henley -101

JoeyKnish22,i cant tell if the shed a tear joke was hed be proud that i pulled off a twitter live bet profit or that i hedged. or even something else i may not be aware of like hes got bad allergies going rn and couldnt see it.
JoeyKnish22,the key here being unlike notre dame and oklahoma futures last year. instead of being -14 or higher in a playoff game. if lsu made it in at 11-1 with the victories theyd have (and accompanying power rating) the 33/1 would actually have value/be trade-able for profit.
TheKostos,"daily fantasy sports  worry everyone the astros are ""looking into it"" and conducting an ""investigation.""

i  daily fantasy sports  know about you but it makes me feel better knowing the organization that blatantly cheated is policing the matter internally. they definitely deserve the benefit of the doubt."
TheKostos,i consume a lot of sneaker content on instagram and youtube and wanted to give a shoutout to my fav sneaker reviewer jd.  daily fantasy sports  know the dude personally but he answers questions over insta and i dig his content. if you're into sneaker content follow:
LockyLockerson,after we had adam on the show last week i started listening to this (very short therefore easily consumable) podcast and i enjoy it.  i go down my list of games on my excel as he does and just kind of make mental notes.  would definitely recommend!
LockyLockerson,"for what  it is  worth  i woke up thinking i'd be adding northwestern and the number torpedoed back to mine so nothing there.

also my projections say i'm absolutely supposed to be betting umass ( and ucla (@ no one) but i'm not.  whatever  that is  worth."
LockyLockerson,"chapter 3: the nightcap

730p syracuse +28
730p florida state +7
8p ucla +23.5 (but you can probably get even better by waiting)
8p nebraska -14
1030p arizona +2

will probably have totals in the morning once i can confirm wind/weather and stuff and get some sleep."
LockyLockerson,"a few widely-available bets i've made for tomorrow...i'm actually waiting on about a dozen more because i think i may get a better number but here's what i've put in already (times et):

11a pitt -4
1030p stanford +3
1030p cal +13.5

updates coming in the morning!"
DannyParkins,"17 of the top 18 passing yards leaders had played either 11 or 12 games coming into today. 

pat mahomes was 10th in passing yards despite playing in only 9 games. hes healthy and his offensive skill guys are now healthy. i think the chiefs roll today."
DannyParkins,ive never once denied that. i am a cubs fan. everyone in media has bias. the ones you can trust are the people who admit their biases. i really dont get what you think youve uncovered here. this isnt politics or news. its sports entertainment. lighten up.
DannyParkins,predicting nfl discipline is next to impossible because  it is  so inconsistent but given tyreek hill's awful history i can't imagine roger is gonna take it lightly that the da believes a crime took place resulting in a child's injury. i'd expect a lengthy punishment. awful story.
DannyParkins,yup every hour will be podcasted after the show. it was basically... this guy is an all-time great who is relatively anonymous and has some distinctions i dont think most people know (1 of 4 with 30k pts/10k rebs for ex) just an appreciation of his greatness.
DannyParkins,im off on previously scheduled paternity leave for the next week and have now been quoted by two people who cover the sports talk radio industry on how the format will program with no sports. i relish the opportunity. just entertain. already looking forward to being back.
DannyParkins,shoutout to  for sending ribs brisket and burnt ends from  to celebrate owens birth. weve got a kc feast for the game. if i fall asleep on the final word tonight (yea im on tv on fox locally after the damn super bowl?!?) blame the meat sweats.
Gingfacekillah,hopefully my data science msc helps me to get closer to your level in this respect. went with python for the database design and management strengths. like you said if you set it up right you can test faster increase your rate of failure and eventually succeed.
logan_matthews9,"4) ignore all that dont work in sports and make actual money

sports job much like other seemingly glamorous titles such as college coaching prey on massive candidate pools to keep salaries very low (besides the top 1 percent ) and force horrible hours to maintain competitiveness"
logan_matthews9,"market update starting with matchups:

almost all positive movements. best of luck took reavie to +165 but hes +140/+155 elsewhere. casey went to +105 even though the reed line moved against woodland. i believe everything is positive not sure id take anything that moved besides na -110"
logan_matthews9,would mean the world seems hyperbolic to say the least. if he wants to play for the us hes got every opportunity and theyve done everything to show they want him (surely far more than mexico). just seemed like a guy using his dual nationality as leverage
PikachuBets,you are so full of shit lololol. please speak with actual degen fund bros about where and how they gamble before you make wild claims like this on the interwebz...while you're at it could you make it more obvious you  daily fantasy sports  know shit about gambling?
PikachuBets,"like i said you are either 1) looking to scam with this horrifically bad ""mistake"" or 2) so inept that you can't even rollout your product on multiple nationwide media outlets without major mistakes. what other mistakes are you gonna have down the line with this ineptitude?"
PikachuBets,"""i'm responsible for everything i wrote  that is  why i went back and deleted all tweets about my stupid idiotic arrogant promises about 70u season  the $10k bet i challenged someone to and lost and tried to welch on. but hey i'm responsible ok not my dad"""
PikachuBets,it sounds like you just dont like college basketball. you like the nba level stuff. great you should go watch nba then. but comparing all of college basketball with the select few who were elite enough to go nba is a terrible way to evaluate college ball.
adamchernoff,the betting market and understanding why games move. if you do not have an odds screen get one. donbest is extremely expensive for most bettors but it works well (usually) and tracks bookmakers that other odds comparison websites do not. when you get a screen align your...
adamchernoff,if my goal was to play a basic strategy teaser i would want to ensure that when i make the bet it falls in line with basic strategy. the only way to ensure that (almost) every time is to do it as late as possible to kickoff.
adamchernoff,"nfl week 2 is interesting because we have a couple key pieces of info that tell us a lot about which teams bookmakers are bumping up and down in price point as well as which performances and over reactions the betting market is buying and selling.

listen:"
adamchernoff,"at some point the cycle becomes predictive and either through having brief success ""fading the public"" or seeing results align with not predictive trends a bettor believes they have an edge without being able to quantify or explain it at all. personally i do not believe that..."
adamchernoff,true story. i am drinking margaritas with  right now and we were talking about your podcast and i was explaining how you can submit a show for $25 per read for erectile distinction reads per 500 people and we cracked up about you reading an ed ad.
adamchernoff,not saying its not a bet to make. but given the teams they will face and their perception in the market (and how expensive outrights can be) rolling over a stake on them advance the next three matches will likely be more profitable than the outright price.
adamchernoff,amazing how many people forget that mahomes is a less athletic but slightly more accurate replica of kaepernick. colin did it in a far less spread/friendly era of the league too. nobody thinks of turning down mahomes yet nobody wants kaepernick. time is the issue not skill.
adamchernoff,"favourite odds tool: 

surprise here but  odds feed has overtaken the place of donbest in my betting tools. their feed is free responsive customizable and does the job for 98 percent  of bettors. the sg acquisition of db might change it but sbr was great this year."
ToddFuhrman,"the hardest part about betting sports is dealing with the  variance.

no matter how sharp you are or trusting of your numbers there will inevitably be a miserable stretch over an extended sample size serving as a reminder how important bankroll management is to long term success"
ToddFuhrman,we  daily fantasy sports  often see such a strong move around key numbers against liability in a prime time game.  even monday with pro cash on the lions ticket distribution wasn't this lopsided and books willingness to move onto a key # here is a strong statement
ToddFuhrman,"i can't see a single scenario why we wouldn't want anyone outside the university meddling in college athletics...i mean what could possibly go wrong in this type of model

i can't wait until a 13 year old is paid by a booster to influence his college commitment"
ToddFuhrman,"when it comes to previewing the upcoming football season

if you want a jaded perspective ask a fan...

if you want a self serving fabricated narrative ask a media member...

if you want an impartial assessment of good vs bad devoid of emotion ask a sports bettor"
12Xpert,a well known example is over/under markets. 60 percent  of bettors typically bet on the over. whilst that doesn't imply that also means 60 percent  of the turnover  it is  likely that it won't be 50-50. hence if bookmakers just balanced action they would offer incorrect prices.
12Xpert,thats such a bullshit line. what does consensus mean? ordinarily you would stick your house on this if you could be bothered to wait but theres always a chance the bookmaker takes a different view on the meaning of the word to yours. scientific consensus? trump voters?
12Xpert,"the two explanations i have are:

1) nish is hitting on same tennis inefficiency that pinnacle knowingly offers punters because they know they will make more money by offering it.

2) the fact that he and many of his customers operate via a broker influences pinnacle's response."
12Xpert,"again  that is  obviously pretty meaningless because  it is  basically a truism.

we have to go looking for it somewhere in between but  it is  tricky because of these 2 problems: variance at 1 end truism at other.

(in)efficiency is an elusive creature a bit like will-o'-the-wisp."
12Xpert,my attempt at a premiership heat map.  daily fantasy sports  know if  it is  any good. measures over/under performance relative to market expectation as defined by closing  1x2 odds. score is cumulative for the season. -1 through to -6 are cumulative scores -1 -2 etc matches before.
12Xpert,"furthermore once your ""skill"" has seen off losing players you'll need more to come to the platform to make your model for making a living work. of course maybe losers will carry on playing and losing forever some losing their shirts along the way. happy with that?"
12Xpert,i suppose in the end those who  daily fantasy sports  want to leave will always present arguments for why it should be prevented: illegal. undemocratic. you're stupid. non binding. didn't know what we were voting for.  it is  a shame people can't accept others' points of view.
12Xpert,but  it is  the unintended consequences that are far more difficult to model. the economy is a complex system like the climate.  it is  why prediction scenarios often prove to be way off the mark. at least climate scientists understand error a bit better than political ones.
12Xpert,so bruno never did make his $24 million. whoever owns it now is obviously still scamming. no one would sell 60 percent + win rates. if these were possible long term it would be your personal gold making machine. touts advertising these are either cheats or deluded.
12Xpert,"i'm guessing that this is because the monte carlo and  calculator uses the same odds for every bet but the actual ""record"" had much more variable odds. ""record"" is shown in quotes because we're not really talking about a record here are we really just a pattern"

mschwimer,as i mentioned all questions and points can be answered by   anyone with questions can simply use that outlet.  this is way more of a back and forth type of conversation.  all will become very clear on a podcast why it simply can't be done on twitter.
mschwimer,unit size will remain at 1.  we use all betcris/bookmaker lines to judge our plays.  guarantee has nothing to do with the subscriber.  just as long as betcris/bookmaker has the line up at the time we place the bet and subs can get $300 on the rec.
mschwimer,we had a talk a while back about why she charges as she definitely doesnt have to. she brought up a great point. people dont stick to free work out plans. but when they pay for it they usually stick with it. it makes sense to me.
jeffma,just had the most terrible customer service experience with  ordered stuff and paid $35 extra for saturday delivery. had things delivered to hotel where i will be until wednesday. stuff not supposed to arrive until friday. offering zero help to me and hung up on me
jeffma,this is just silly. we are not in a leadership position in this sport to be proposing rule changes at the college level that are not adopted at the international level. it puts us at a disadvantage at the international level. remember the 2 point rule?
SportsCheetah,my good buddy  was in town this past weekend and was posting some of his bets he made at  i wasn't following along live and was really surprised to see this number. the new line for nearly 60 minutes of football remaining was essentially steelers +2.5.
SportsCheetah,i'm not a doctor i  daily fantasy sports  really know. tend to think  it is  more physically and mentally taxing though. they're a jokic 4-6 week injury from being lock under (let alone missing more time than that). seems like 80+ games again is an underdog.
capjack2000,no. however market liquidity is not large enough for there to be much discernible info in any one book's bet percent  numbers. one book could have 88 percent  phi money another could have 77 percent  ind money. neither is wrong neither is right both are useless.
capjack2000,"lets focus on how the nfl would have been oblivious to this if not for the sportsbook reporting the suspicious behavior. 

this isnt a problem resulting from the proliferation of legalized sportsbetting. it is the solution to a problem that the leagues have ignored for decades."
capjack2000,"full kelly is risky and sharp bettors know that since you can't exactly quantify your edge in most sportsbetting full kelly is foolish. 

if he were to use a safer .25 kelly approach his bankroll requirements for such a wager balloon to:

$4440700 

maybe our friend..."
capjack2000,"many will report on the bettor who won $600k at  with ravens 59-10 victory at $30k/pt with a 20x stop-loss. 

but imagine if they had the default 50x stop-loss. 

here's what you do pointsbet: pretend you lost $1.29m and just won $690k back. feels better right?"
capjack2000,"5) parlay/teaser/super teaser/jackpot cards
another nv staple that hasnt shown up in nj yet. parlay cards are often a sucker bet but they are wildly popular. rollover jackpots can produce a lot of buzz. plenty of ways to avoid having stale cards with todays technology. 

7/7"
capjack2000,"a lot of people discussing the biggest winners and losers from the penn gaming partnerpalooza yesterday. 

biggest loser imo is bet365

they went from pre-paspa favorite to dominate the us to now still sitting on the sidelines while most of the future us is divvied up."
capjack2000,"assuming an 85/15 split between mobile and retail.
assuming the 13.5 percent  tax on mobile and 8.5 percent  tax on retail.
assuming a 5 percent  hold on mobile betting.
assuming a 7 percent  hold on retail betting.

projected total sports handle in nj in march: $405.6m"
capjack2000,to be fair... that is  the same line (-120) that they deal in nj with a much lower tax rate. i think the tax difference will show itself in the promos offered to consumers. which really means they're passing it onto the bettors via opportunity cost.
capjack2000,"i think there's definitely a crossover audience between online sports and online casino that doesn't exist in bm marriages. 

for instance the ability to chase losses and gamble winnings seems to be much easier with a shared online wallet. *i  daily fantasy sports  consider this good*"
dinkinc,mri gave no concrete answers but seemed to rule out the worst of the possiblities.... doc says spinal tap is next... i hope she enjoys the movie as much as i did but not sure why they want her to watch it...much needed nap for me
dinkinc,there are two fundraisers at  coming up in june..the big one on the 22nd with many retired hall of fame jockeys and the  one on june 15th.. please  daily fantasy sports  overlook the latter which rescues lesser known racehorses and saves them from slaughter. bring dad
robpizzola,this creates an issue where you need a clear view of exactly where the ball is to overturn on replay. thats not an issue on this specific one is the rose bowl but is often an issue when theres a lot of bodies around the ball.
robpizzola,i really hate to have to say this but for context every kid in my neighborhood can afford a costume. and honestly the best costume i saw tonight was a kid who probably wrapped himself in toilet paper for a buck to look like a mummy.
robpizzola,raichubets vs. pikachubets would be a long drawn out capping contest with each of them hitting each other with plays that are not very effective (lots of negative expected value stuff) golembets would definitely own the much weaker pikachubets with some six-game round robin parlay winners.
robpizzola,merely stating what the point was not whether or not i agree with it. people aren't saying that joe harris  klay thompson. also  for what  it is  worth  i do think that klay is one of the most overrated players in the history of this league.
robpizzola,"its not that easy tbh.

the vast majority of people that actually know what theyre doing really dont want to talk about it publicly all that much. so theyre left choosing from a huge pool of people that bet but are delivering bad/misleading/garbage content and info."
RASPicks,again when someone is so clearly wrong about other things it is hard to believe they will be right about something like a +230 money back guarantee. even if he has good intentions he easily could be misinformed about the ability and/or intent to pay out.
RASPicks,agree some of the coach's against the spread records are useless and there can be overreaction to them but i  daily fantasy sports  agree there is zero predictive value with certain head coach's approach to the games some of which are reflected in those same records.
RASPicks,"when evaluating any handicapper beware of the ""discovery year"" bias.  in most cases a handicapper's first year on record should be discounted or not considered at all.  if someone tracking their plays loses in their first year they are always likely to disappear or start over."
RASPicks,in all seriousness even if you win on your own  it is  possible to win more with partners/networking. which i assume you know. there are other less obvious benefits that i  daily fantasy sports  care to get into but always happy to discuss offline if interested.
VegasRefund,"no box score is more misleading this week then the raiders/packers.

- fumble on gbs 1
- interception on gbs 15
- jacobs stuffed on 4th on the 1

p.s. fumbling out of the end zone might be the single worst rule in all of sports."
ProfessorShine,points i made that she she sells product that makes no sense makes her a poor handicapper.  she is fraudulent due to her past deleting of losing plays and offering picks on some sites and not others. a classic freeroll.   bottom line she has no edge.
suuma810,without desean that banged-up receiving corps looked lost. no speed. after the early part of the season they led the league in drops by a mile. but in recent weeks i thought that wentzs play was off too. many bad throws. seems like a bad combo.
suuma810,"we can argue about the ceiling of tyrod and his safe playing style but if you think the bills would be 2-3 with him you are out of your mind.

buffalo's d held every opponent to 17 or fewer points despite 11 turnovers by josh allen."
suuma810,wenn von miller gegen mitchell schwartz ber 60 minuten probleme hat sagt das se hour viel ber die individuelle qualitt aus. und wenn miller da probleme hat schlgt sich das natrlich positiv auf die gesamte pass pro aus. mit flowers wre die ol auch gesamt schlechter.
ClevTA,i wasnt listening to the tv when it was on. was this confirmed the rule? and  for what  it is  worth  if the gm was tied the final 30 seconds wouldve played out differently. im sure chicago would have sat on the ball but who knows
ClevTA,a bad ol trying to run up the middle in heavy formation is a horrible idea at all times. all u have to do is throw a 3 yard pass to your rb instead if thats all u want. but your way really works out well
ClevTA,not sure whats going to happen tonight but denver now has 3 of the top 20 cbs in the nfl in terms of opp qb passer rating allowed from last year. add 2nd year chubb + fangio  theres a chance it gets ugly for carr tonight
CizzlingSports,"fyi the last time  went all ""dont eff w/vegas"" he filed a lawsuit half of which was dismissed by a federal judge dragged the case out for 2 years settled for essentially nothing and oh yeah  great investigative piece is still up for everyone to read"
spanky,yes their ignorance is profound. bot betting does not alter lines.  bot betting does not allow past posting. bot betting does not alter game outcomes. bot betting is not cheating. its a tool used to get down as much as possible as fast as possible. #beabookmakernotadressmaker
spanky,a few weeks ago many sportsbooks both offshore and in vegas refused to take action because don best was down.  in todays world most bookmakers are crippled without knowing where they stand vs the market.  very few if any have their own set of numbers.  (2/2)
spanky,a pro will never reveal his best plays.  and  may be touts but they will give out chocolate chips not the whole cookie.  gives out crumbs for free (why i  daily fantasy sports  know). i never discuss any plays. market too thin to toy with self-cannibalization.
spanky,i think it gives me a higher chance than staying quiet.im trying to encourage sportsbooks to employ proper risk management without having to resort to the extreme measure of banishing winners.  golden nugget admitted their lines suck. maybe hire a better company to run lines etc
aluckyaday,you would prefer that they prefer not to do that. as a business it is their choice how to operate. what you prefer is irrelevant. it is what the majority of their customers prefer is what matters. as they will never see a trader decision letter...
aluckyaday,having established soft books in the uk has shown the dangers recreational gambling poses to vulnerable people yet i see nothing in the us legislation about this. forcing books to have procedures in place to identify vulnerable players and interact with them before its too late.
aluckyaday,this is an issue though. these soft books now operating in the us take the recreational money away from the traditional books. it makes it very hard for them to operate taking mainly sharp money. ultimately like europe the traditional books will become become dressmakers too.
aluckyaday,this was the issue with id checks and why the gambling commission now requires them to check on account opening. so i guess the logical extension of that has to be that sof checks have to be done on deposit rather than waiting for a withdrawal.
aluckyaday,you are making those decisions because of the effect dopamine and norepinephrine has on your brain. as a random recreational punter that does tend to be the driving factor but it is not the rational thing to do if your only goal is to maximize profits.
aluckyaday,at the bottom of the last article there is an excel sheet to calculate distribution of the yield based on your roi number of bets and average price. although you are making a profit you may be surprised how often that can happen just by luck.
aluckyaday,the problem is the main competition for sharp books are other sharp books not punters. ultimately there can only be one sharp price within vig. sharp books are also global. it is virtually impossible for a local sharp book to compete with a global one.  1/2
aluckyaday,it is. but traditionally most people  daily fantasy sports  bet them that way. maybe that is changing. but chasing the 2/3 times winners at higher prices causes the fav/longshot bias to take max effect. making it a +ev bet for the books even with the bonuses.
aluckyaday,yes. but when you are looking at a collection of tipster from a supermarket rather than just an individual it should be possible to compare the single tipster with that population that they belong too. if they are special they should be doing better than expected.
aluckyaday,365 is a marketing company not a bookmaker. it needs the big turnover/ hold to fund that marketing. without restrictions is that marketing model possible? look at portugal where gambling is now legal but the big operators are not interested. tax stop that model working there.
aluckyaday,but we did have some influence in the eu and had the eus power when negotiating trade deals with other countries. outside the eu we are a small country that the big world trade players can bully and take advantage of. just ask mexico and canada.
aluckyaday,the books they use tend not to mind being arbed. in fact the likes of pinnacle etc encourage it. not sure if sportmarket do it but a lot of the asia aggregators profile you and will take some of your action themselves if they see fit!
aluckyaday,you can perform a hypothesis test to get a level of confidence that your returns are not due to luck. it depends on the price and how many bets you have but you can put a number on it. a lot better than just saying probably!
aluckyaday,back how this conversation started. if you have a model close to pinnacles that can identify when pinnacle have deliberately moved away from what they think is efficient. have a bettor model than them (unlikely) or have better data it is possible to profit at close.
aluckyaday,yes. but because their are millions of touts even really unlikely returns over thousands of picks are possible by luck. if you have a million touts one of them is likely to have a record that would only happen by luck 1 in a million times!
aluckyaday,although i dislike them because of the survivorship bias try the european proofing sites. transparent records with checks on availability of prices. unethical touts are a small problem when the whole gambling industry is based on convincing people its easy to win when it is not!
joeyisaks,isnt the spirit of sports betting to try to make $? books can make their rules and bettors can try any advantage besides tampering actual games... if i want to build software to find line discrepancies in a small market why shouldnt i be able to?
EdMillerPoker,"someone posted about googling the name for the common baseball elbow surgery and being presented with ads for jock straps due to a company selling them of the same name

i *read* the post and clicked nothing and now ive been assigned to the jockstrap internet."
EdMillerPoker,i ask that bc i created huge databases of contest entries from those csvs and then used them to research lineup construction and for sure used my programming skills to do so and that behavior gave me a real meaningful edge that cost other players ev.
EdMillerPoker,"daily fantasy sports  see what that has to do with ""scripting"". my only point is to this day i see ppl refer to ""scripting"" in  daily fantasy sports  like it was some huge scandal and i still  daily fantasy sports  get it. like where's the scandal?"
EdMillerPoker,"agree with this idea. there is a lot of potential volume that is simply not realized today.

i dont expect 365 and clones to overhaul a very successful business model to capture it. but its out there and someone (possibly new) will eventually tap into it."
EdMillerPoker,imo  it is  a lot of fomo. in-play betting is brand new here and poorly understood by most. i think things will settle out in a year or two once everyone understands how the sausage gets made and the value of each part of the process.
EdMillerPoker,to this end we're ramping up operationally right now.  it is  one thing to have good models (which is what i've been working on for a while).  it is  another to consistently put up line after line in real-time and make as few mistakes as possible.
EdMillerPoker,"also i wanted to update y'all on what we're doing the next few months and you can decide if it can help you out.

i've spent the last few years focused on in-play betting for american sports especially nfl  college football  mlb and  college basketball ."
EdMillerPoker,"among those

* regulators won't tolerate some of the tactics operators use to mitigate poor pricing

EdMillerPoker,in general agree with some of your criticisms and i guess i think that operators who think progressively and focus more on the customer experience will see a competitive advantage for themselves. obv could end up being dead wrong about that dont have a crystal ball.
EdMillerPoker,yup. ppl look at that soft field on day one and figure they have a huge edge and then by day three theyre the soft field. same phenomenon in  daily fantasy sports  gpps which is why the emphasis on gpps stunted the whole fantasy sports thing.
EdMillerPoker,"sub ""anti-abortion activists"" for vegans in his tweet and i think more ppl would understand what i disliked about it. both groups are organized against what they see as an ethical catastrophe and agree or not  it is  not remotely about ""preferring tomatoes"" in either case"

nonrandomalpha,yes correct i was being general and making a macro statement as in generally the sec is a dominant conference in totality not that every component of the sec is in itself dominant. annoying that this has to be explicitly articulated for so many to understand...smdh.
LeeSharpeNFL,"fair though i think that could create positional in different way (some positions have higher variance than others).

but regardless i hadn't thought of the goal that way (easy to get stuck in a value-based mindset) and i like it. we should do that you're right."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think 7 points is the better threshold when examining probabalistically but in terms of ""can i see a path to victory  as i watch in real time"" 8 points is right number to think about. you care more about ""plausibility"" than how likely it is."
LeeSharpeNFL,i mean when you look at it from a neutral fan perspective  that is  clearly worse entertainment. and  it is  kind of unfair to the teams who might be hoping for the upset. makes week 17 far less relevant.  it is  not good for the sport.
LeeSharpeNFL,"your mitch trubisky stat of the day:

mitch trubisky when throwing passes to targets beyond the first down marker has the lowest completion percentage over expectation (cpoe) at -7.7 percent .

 that is  33rd out of 33 qbs with at least 100 passing attempts in 2019."
LeeSharpeNFL,"the ravens have such a high early down rush epa/play that it would be in the top half of the entire league's early down **passing** epa/play.

 that is  incredible and how they can justify being in the lower-right portion of the graph in the above tweet."

DannyParkins,sean payton is gonna win this challenge. the bears running game is so broken they have to result to tosses to anthony miller with david montgomery as the lead blocker. blame nagy if you want but they dont have the personnel to run the ball traditionally.
DannyParkins,just as it would be fiscally catastrophic for adam silver lebron james nike or anyone else involved to just tell china off completely. the nba is a for profit business that has a huge stake there just like apple mcdonalds the government marriott and countless others.
DannyParkins,"if it wasnt for his talent level we would probably have a different view... of jordan kobe moss bonds and plenty of other all-time greats. 

rodgers isnt blameless but thats the point. he has that talent level so youve gotta do everything possible to maximize him."
DannyParkins,talk to drivers. 5 is supposed to be standard. they get taken off the road if the rating falls below a 4.5 and i think stop qualifying for bonuses if it falls below 4.8. they should do a better job informing riders of consequences of ratings.
Gingfacekillah,one of the better ready-made wager tracking sheets out there. grab the standard version rather than basic to track closing line value in both points and line moves. i also add an additional sheet to calculate p-values for betting records segmented by sport and bet type:
Gingfacekillah,embiid with 2 pf after 1q. if this game continues playing out as forecasted you can expect him to hang back pick up drbs and ease up on his paint drives. thats the basic rationale behind this thread the needle play. a positive sign so far.
Gingfacekillah,"a bit of a nail biter but det manages to take care of their ridiculous -12 spread over lal. total (u) also hit easily. beat the closing line and the spread. nice cash.

forecasted: det -21.51 206.08 (u)
line: det -12 215.5
result: det -14 208."
Gingfacekillah,update: i've been told that in order to take the msc applied stats i'll have to take linear algebra and calculus i  ii as prereqs. that particular school didn't consider my electrical math background sufficient. the msc data science was however satisfied with my math background.
Gingfacekillah,youre basically going to use random sampling with replacement to turn a sample of 20 games into 500 games or whatever number you choose. this gives you a confidence interval for your distribution and makes the distribution fitting more reliable. best of luck with your model!
Gingfacekillah,"(1/3)
mental exercise:
1) start with 10000000 sports bettors.
2) they all make one pick every day on the same game.
3) 50 percent  pick team a 50 percent  pick team b.
4) day one: 5000000 winners 5000000 losers.
5) day two: 2500000 winners 2500000 losers."
Gingfacekillah,"poisson at its finest?

i see what you mean here. however which model mindset gets us closer to the truth of the underlying signal? some form xg based on xs percent  xshots xsave percent   with a poisson distribution and a standard error would be my vote."

adamchernoff,"the more work i do the more i feel like there is a (small) potential for this line to be one of the worst prices all season come sunday evening. but i am curious what do you think? 

who covers in week 17 washington or dallas?"
adamchernoff,as i said on the podcast this morning this is not advocation to go out and blindly bet every under. in fact i think the opposite may be in play for many games where suppressed totals can provide an opportunity to consider a fair priced over.
adamchernoff,"i had no idea i could anger so many people by presenting numbers and analysis (in a fair manner) on a football team until i started a youtube channel!

comments to the video are hilarious. you be the judge...was i unfair in my titans assessment?

link:"
adamchernoff,"sunday night football. 

caption suggests the texans are better off falling behind which is not what i was getting at. the video discusses ne increasing their 1st half pace and how efficient hou is when trailing. regardless the video breaks down my bet on the over."
adamchernoff,bit of a misleading caption. i explain in the video that ne totals are suppressed  defensive numbers are inflated because they played cle phi  dal in the past four weeks in extreme wind and rain. it will look different on  sunday night football  in controlled conditions.
adamchernoff,well i think more sports betting is a good thing in any form. but the folks in las vegas (mike being a prime example) have perfected the land based model. the blue print was there to replicate but that flagship location certainly whiffed on many levels.
adamchernoff,"speed:

customers are there to gamble. the number of barriers questions and decisions that stand between the money in their pocket and the transaction should be as close to 0 as possible. the fewer there are the more successful the product/experience will be for both parties."
adamchernoff,browns backed into success with an accidental game play against the ravens. they may ultimately end up getting forced into the right game plan this week by ne. variance here hinges on mayfield. the -13 looks both awfully short and too much at the same time.
adamchernoff,well. hell. i ran out of space for a twitter thread. didn't know that was possible. nevertheless if you need a free odds screen use sbr. i'll continue the explanation another day or on the podcast. time for a quick nap then back to nfl write-ups.
adamchernoff,awesome! the first nfl workbooks are beginning to arrive. each book has a two page writeup on where to look for data but i will be doing video tutorials soon where everyone can follow along and work through handicapping games with me for the upcoming week.
adamchernoff,that would be great. but how likely would it be? from the corporate side i would say there would be more upside to reduce future risk and continue spending on brand/acquisition rather than increasing risk and expenses to source compilers create new models and maintain them.
adamchernoff,despite all five teams having new oc's each has moved towards the record. majority of preseason moves are on widely available info. with effort put in to gauging how teams actually play it becomes quite possible to take advantage of over reaction. nothing moves in sync.
Ccon8181,i put it out earlier. as i mentioned a fair amount of time ill move the line i bet into. not so much with sone new shops. tonight the line moved against me. some -5.5 poping up. im in at -6 #rams # sunday night football
Ccon8181,it was a successful 3-1 week plus a 1-0 week previously. want to share the profits with my followers. reply  guess the combined score of both #mnf games correctly for $200 if nobody gets it closest gets $100. must be following me to collect #nfltwitter #nflpicks
Ccon8181,really?! this guy was a total clown. how they can stay in business with clowns like this is beyond me. had a box betting decent sums and the managers pretty much told me they made a mistake but fuck off. haha. glad football is almost here
Ccon8181,classic #ohiostate b-ball... wont do shit all season/game verse competition but get a chance to show out verse some 3rd string scrubs and they go all in. where was that effort all year?? or in this game when it mattered?? unreal.. vent over onto the next.
12Xpert,"i very much suspect that this distribution is just like betting performances. almost normal (i.e. luck) because there's a 'paradox-of-skill ""arms"" race' going on but there are a few who are geniuses and have real positive and meaningful alpha. i assume messi is in that category."
12Xpert,the other side of the anti-gambling argument. as with so many social issues today things are complex and nuanced and no one is served by the extreme polarisation of views that typically occurs. society should have a proper debate about gambling rather than just condemning it.
12Xpert,if you're aware of it stop going boom and misleading punters that profits mean skill. your whole position on this is tautological. i effectively asked you whether profits at a roulette wheel imply skill and you said obviously not because that involves a random distribution (1/2)
12Xpert,depends on what his probability was of losing one week and that depends on how many bets he has each week and what the odds are. suppose its 75 percent . 23 consecutive is 1-in-1000. if thats the worst in 1000 players then its hardly surprising.
12Xpert,you first popped up suggesting your system cast doubt on clvh. so yes it was my work you were questioning. i wanted to point out that your system didnt do what was being claimed and took the trouble to explain to others why that was so.
mschwimer,question to twittersphere. has a nfl team ever gone 6-0 in their division and not win their division? i think the browns have a realistic shot at doing this. 2 vs. bengals. 2 vs. steelers. ravens at home. but will probably be 2-5 after new england.
mschwimer,gotcha. yea the models really dont like josh allen. 2 biggest factors in productive qb play is accuracy and decision making. he is bad at both. he is a good runner and massive arm strength. but those things arent nearly as important. according to our #s
mschwimer,"responding to previous comment even though i hate doing it. 

im already very rich. i can retire and never have to work a day in my life. but that wouldnt be fun. you can verify this! look at our company valuation. i own 56 percent ."
mschwimer,read up about our company. check out the sec filing. we raised $23m for jambos. a lot of peoples reputations are on the line. i dont know of a better way to guarantee payment. if you can think of a better way please let me know.
RufusPeabody,but the release price (or better!) is still available for some of the picks. at least you get some +ev action you might think. wrong! the subset of games where prices did *not* move in the tout's favor indicates market resistance on those plays. (4/6)

SportsCheetah,only because  it is  a 10:30pm island game aka small likely negative expected value proposition... but utep getting 2.5 now is a tad extreme imo.  let us  go miners. also the over because a wise man once said life's too short to bet the under.
SportsCheetah,"both overestimating and underestimating fantasy points by at least 10 relative to the betting market. i made a joke last week about ""playoff push"" and the player model being overly excited for fantasy points but ultimately weather/backup qbs just aren't accounted for as well imo"
SportsCheetah,wyoming has 3 trips inside the af 10 too and couldnt convert a single  touchdown  or it wouldnt have mattered. after af doing csu so dirty with the 100-yard pick-6 final minute they have to be a clear favorite for whatever that award is called.
SportsCheetah,the roi is really strong for season win totals across all leagues imo. i bet them at a high volume to try and maximize that. i've always kept a separate bankroll allotted for futures bets though so it doesn't interfere with day-to-day or week-to-week stuff.

suuma810,"yeah but linehan didnt do that and there are some things that teams should always do to optimize their expected efficiency.

suuma810,i cannot bet on either team here thats why im passing. harbaugh was hopeful he starts. i would actually like ravens more with lamar because he possesses a big threat to the bengals d on the ground. ravens ocs familiar with that kind of qb.
ClevTA,3 gms of the 9 were at home and brissett with the pats was the only winner. 56 percent  2  touchdown  3 int for those qbs. the other two guys got blown out. may not mean a ton but interesting for rookies on short weeks

aluckyaday,that is another advantage the europeans have. they are used to rolling out their products in different european countries each with different gambling regulations and taxation structure. each us state will be treated in a similar way to expanding in to a new eu country.
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  think its just a brexiteer thing. its seems obvious to me but the remain politicians  daily fantasy sports  seem to want to highlight it either. maybe they like seeing the opposition trying to put a square peg in a round hole!
aluckyaday,"a general problem with third party streaming is everything is not under the control of the streamer. as soon as the stream enters a public network throughput can not be guaranteed. there is a reason why isps always quote ""up to"" in their speeds ."
aluckyaday,you have to remember these books have high acquisition and marketing costs. even if you are a small losing punter you are probably not net profitable business for them. whether you lost is not really relevant their calculated expectation on your bets are what matter.
aluckyaday,i have a computer science degree . it is people running models that have caused the books to learn how to do this themselves. books have a big disadvantage known as adverse selection. they have to quote everything modeling punters only have to bet value.
aluckyaday,it is interesting if they have chosen to use the 2up prices for the feeds to comparison sites etc. you would have though they would have used the better enhanced prices to drive traffic but maybe they  daily fantasy sports  want ultra price sensitive customers.

aluckyaday,well i thought it was quite an appropriate one! i'm confident (but cant be certain) that some professional gamblers have just hit the lottery  (via  survivorship bias). probably applies to poker more because of the bigger variance but sports bettors are not immune to randomness.

nonrandomalpha,eagles had no business covering that game tho - skins was right side. panthers costly turnovers and inability to capitalize on rams fumbles hurt. we lost on panthers as well and are  we even included it...we were overly influenced by line movement on this one...
nonrandomalpha,preseason expectations for what spreads will be in week 9 for example are not relevant to our analysis it just reiterates the same narrative that the win total already implies. over 10 wins is a high hurdle and essentially prices in almost everything going right.
LeeSharpeNFL,"lamar jackson is a case in complete opposite direction so i suspect my model may be low on the 2019 ravens for similar reasons.

definitely looks like a case where their unique scheme means the qb grade wouldn't translate as well into the expected epa/play."
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  saying from 3rd down forward -- after controlling for yards until a first down position on the field and game script -- the ravens have converted on these series +15 percent  better than expected while the packers have converted them about at expectation.
LeeSharpeNFL,the lions feel like they have finally turned things around after many years are are have had awful luck vs. both the chiefs and the packers and now this. i feel really bad for them and despite playing my team today wish he was healthy.
whale_capper,yeah  that is  fair saw little sign of tanking in the data until mid-march which is late compared to the last three seasons... i just had an eyebrow raised when the jazz numbers ballooned during a stretch when they happened to play the suns 3x
AndyMSFW,round 2 bets were trash (1-7 -2.292x) but luckily offset by some full tourney wins settled by the cut.   so while i'm pissed about how it went i'm still up +1.3 units with a +1400 dechambeau ticket in tow. i guess it could be worse.
AndyMSFW,learned some lessons two weeks ago betting some golf.  match-ups broke even but betting like a dozen top20 props turned out to be a little too aggressive and went pretty fucking poorly.  working out how to go after quail hollow as we speak.  #golftalk #deadheatrules
AndyMSFW,i would have said sdsu they are a top 5 three-point shooting team and should be capable of a comeback but this is wild.  i won't be too heartbroken if they can't come back i'm holding a nice number on omaha to win the tourney.
JoeyKnish22,thinking about starting a new podcast  called the really deep dive where we just hijack all their content. have pizzola start calling himself shark capper or something. hire a photoshop intern and have better wifi service. probably put them out of business in a week.
JoeyKnish22,alright folks. heres the bowl pool signup link. very simple pick side and total for every game best records win (t5 get paid). spreads will be up thursday but you can signup now. once youre in dm  your username and hell give you payment info
JoeyKnish22,burrow should not only win but he should be the unanimous heisman winner. if you vote somebody else first place you should have your vote taken away and probably have to pay a fine for stupidity. theres no logical case for anybody else at 1.
JoeyKnish22,i agree. an lsu win and its over. however an lsu loss + if tua doesnt play or doesnt play particularly well and that definitely opens it up. thought osu players might cannibalize each other but they seem to be trying to rally around/promote young.
JoeyKnish22,not rich enough for me to invest and staying away from nfc north as i think the division probably the most balanced of any in football not much edge to be had. however if i had to bet on one team/price that would be it.
LockyLockerson,phi-jax: jax -3 -105 is fine but the total of 34 seems low compared to the week 2 average so we'll play that.  over 34 to win 1x.  jacksonville was so much fun in this identical situation in week 1 when they were shut out.

DannyParkins,i think it looks really good on tv and i know it wasnt his choice and i support all decisions by  but ive never known nick with anything other than his real close fade so seeing him in person last month with hair was... jarring.
DannyParkins,"deshaun watson was the first fbs quarterback to have 4000 passing yards with 1000 rushing yards in a season. 

lamar jackson is at 2889 passing and 1103 rushing with 2 games to go.

will he ever be the first nfl qb ever to have 4000/1000?"
DannyParkins,matt nagy and the bears invite skepticism and more questions with repeating the personal reasons mantra for roquan. they didnt say everything is ok or and our thoughts are with him. the ambiguity leads one to assume a negative situation and discipline a logical outcome.
DannyParkins,i know i've got a lot of chiefs fan followers so it'll skew this poll a bit but i'm curious how many mvps do you think pat mahomes will win? brady/favre/jim brown have 3. peyton has the record with 5. mahomes won it last year.
DannyParkins,theres literally an alabama clause in dabos most recent contract. hes been asked about it before every meeting between the two programs over the past half decade. if/when saban announces an exit plan of course discussion will ramp up. not sure what more youd expect.

Gingfacekillah,poll: we observe a random population of 15000000 sports bettors. analogously using price's law we might guess that the square root of the population is producing 50 percent  of the results giving us ~3873 bettors producing 50 percent . how would you assess that estimate?
Gingfacekillah,an open-minded creative scientific curiosity is the sweet spot imo. confirmation bias helps you find what you're seeking - whether its true or not. higher success rate finding the signal in the noise when you're exploring without a predetermined outcome in mind to begin with.
Gingfacekillah,no although perhaps there is value there - i haven't checked. what i mean is value on certain single bets often has a correlation to value on another single bet if you can find some determinative link. i recommend doing some work to explore this.
Gingfacekillah,mentions this in sharper. your edge if its real will eventually be swallowed up by the market as it moves towards higher levels of relative efficiency.  it is  a game of outrun. moneyline is worth learning if you're serious about modelling your way to victory.
Gingfacekillah,first r success on day 3. partitioned the data then used random forest bagging ensemble method to amalgamate my 7 models. boosted prediction from 70.9 percent  to 98.03 percent . i barely understood what i did programming wise but made it work. #firstsuccess #rstudio #machinelearning
logan_matthews9,"theres definitely rust/fitness concerns but even without mak or diomande lafc is still more talented

concern is moreso on the leon side whose prez said the match is life or death and they rested players last friday. simultaneously his comments show how lafc is perceived"
logan_matthews9,the greatest part about this whole story is that clay gives out a line that doesnt exist as a recommendation and the market still moves against him to bring that line back. its like a broker giving a stock recommendation that immediately drops 10 percent
logan_matthews9,thats not the case with soccer - because there are three outcomes. so this was my first hurdle. also i generally dont bet the spread in soccer (except +.5). this makes intuitive sense to me because similar to the end of games in other sports...

adamchernoff,tough to disagree there. tb certainly has the best coaching staff of any non-playoff team. i quite like the prospect of lindsay sutton hamilton patrick and fant in denver though. if they throw lamb in there too from the draft it is an interesting unit.
adamchernoff,not sure what number you are holding (i remember you said it in the video) but if it is better than 45 i would be putting back booze and or various poultry in the 2h without concern. this game is playing wide open right now.
adamchernoff,if a gaming machine establishment product - anything - can hit speed isolation and continuity there is zero reason that whatever it is will not be successful. in terms of design for gambling every second of work should be focused on these three areas. period.
adamchernoff,as you fill out your game sheets remember that the purpose is to document information and organize it based on what different types of bettors in the market will value. no right or wrong just keep asking questions and building on the answers you find.

adamchernoff,laws and logistics in the us make it extremely difficult to exist with pooled liquidity from multiple countries. once that challenge is overcome there is a massive educational hurdle to cross getting bettors in the us market to be comfortable with the concept of backing/laying.

12Xpert,this time there are at least two teams possibly three who haven't been declared missing in action. if they win it from here it would arguably be far far greater an achievement than 2015/16 since it will like need 100 points to achieve not 81
12Xpert,as for pro punters yes survivorship bias might be an issue. so probably will paradox of skill. the more opportunities that are created to allow more skilled punters to trade the more likely it is that their skills will cancel out leaving just random noise.
12Xpert,no that would be my explanation. perhaps then we need a tipster supermarket uses monitors odds slippage as a measure of skill (assuming you believe in clvh an idea i also been heavily criticised over). advertised tipsters could then be bought by single individuals. .
12Xpert,your customer care is still not fit for purpose. have asked repeatedly for your affiliate team to reply to me regarding non payment of affiliate revenue. still silence on all fronts. how long will it take? or should i just expect to be ignored forever?
12Xpert,the argument here is not that individual lines are wrong at closing - we know that already. the argument is whether nish's systematic identification of lines that are wrong at closing is lucky or causally connected to something. if the latter what is the something?
12Xpert,until i'm shown a large sample of bettors/tipsters that replicate what we see here i'm not going to change my bayesian prior about  efficiency. yours might be a special case for reasons that have been previously highlighted. samples of one  daily fantasy sports  prove rules.
12Xpert,... that my guess is wrong and they are not efficient but the two together make it look like they are. the bayes in me suggest the latter is much less likely. but i'm merely highlighting the problem with trying to pin these things down.
12Xpert,i'm not saying  it is  impossible i'm saying  it is  very hard and harder than most people believe which is how this conversation started. most bettors are kidding themselves. overconfidence is how betting becomes rationale in the first place. otherwise no one would do it.
12Xpert,since we'll never know which matches will see new information which will move against 538 and which will support it it becomes a random exercise. i suppose this has always been my general warning to bettors. news is random (by definition it has to be).
12Xpert,retrospective pattern spotting is charting/technical analysis and i thought anyone who was serious about betting/investing knew that this is akin to alchemy. mai's selling stuff so when someone puts it to him that his stuff is luck the onus is on him to prove otherwise

RufusPeabody,schwim i get what you're saying. i understand wanting to compare amount of money you have to put up. given you're quoting roi based on that it would make sense for  to recommend what  percent  of their bankroll they should invest in each play.
RufusPeabody,thanks for responding johnny. i'm always up for having that long conversation. i'm sure you know how i feel about transparency. hell  nfl picks are in aggregate negative over the past few years but we still have our long-term record displayed when we post.

spanky,"two paths to sports betting gold.

1.) fundamental analysis- climb the handicapping ladder - very few ever reach the top. many fall off broke.

2.) technical analysis. easier flowery path but long hours required. anticipate moves and attack line discrepancies.

spanky,"the most important criteria in evaluating any bettor is :
do they beat the closing line?  

every established bookmaker makes this their number one gauge. 

wins and losses will come and go. but beating the closing number long term will always yield positive results."

aluckyaday,profiting from sports betting is really hard if trying to do it from knowing about sports/players. there are always people that know more than you and the price is determined by them. it is easier to profit by knowing more about sports betting itself

aluckyaday,exactly the opposite. allowing sharps to bet and having sharp lines is not the way to make the most profit. restricting sharps and targeting recreational players is much more profitable. they have been doing this forever in europe and know what they are doing!

DannyParkins,remember from the infamous interview with pax i referenced the clippers unconventional recruitment of kawhi with ballmer  execs at raptors games when the clippers werent playing. he called it tampering. it wasnt and now the clippers got kawhi and the bulls got thaddeus young.
DannyParkins,milwaukee toronto philly boston indiana and brooklyn are locks to be better than the #bulls in the east. beyond that? id say the 7 seed is possible after two solid free agent moves. the question remains ceiling both in the short and long term.
DannyParkins,thrilled for my man  getting his first of what i assume will be many national shots  coming up at 9pm ct. its long past time for those beyond kc to recognize his incredible talent and sense of humor. sirius 206 or tune in here:
DannyParkins,. will be in studio with me nationally for the majority of this last hour to help fill out brackets pick games and be an actual expert who has watched all these teams. give him a follow and listen on sirius 206 or here:
Gingfacekillah,"covid19 [short thread] 1/n:

i  daily fantasy sports  normally like to comment on matters outside sports modelling but i've received a number of dm's about the coronavirus situation currently cancelling sports leagues around the world and (justifiably) dominating the news cycle. a few thoughts:"
Gingfacekillah,"bayesian statistics the fun way is a perfect introduction to bayesian statistical inference imo. 

agreed on the lrs book - it didn't have much. was hoping for a slightly more technical treatment of  college basketball  from someone with a background in finance. oh well."
Gingfacekillah,pretty sad ball by the pistons. had some nice looks and seem to be buying into the casey offense scheme....but they hit 10/38 3's. if they can get their 3p percent  up they could surprise some teams with the high variance style of play.
Gingfacekillah,looking forward to it. i'm hoping to add another tool to the toolbox for determining model viability and it seems that the closing line value calculations you've mentioned are an effective way to do that with smaller sample sizes than win rate or $$.
Gingfacekillah,"i think many sports bettors understand the relative nature of skill in this endeavour. bill benter won at horses with a logistic regression based model - when personal computers were yet to be commonplace. in order to win your methodology must remain ""relatively"" superior."
logan_matthews9,burrow at least has always had the skill set that pro teams want. id imagine simply being the starter and not horrible wouldve been enough to get drafted. think you might be underselling burrow before this year - 4* tons of offers osu etc
logan_matthews9,i dont agree - besides the injured guys whos the best player whos not in? alfredo morales (who was awful against mexico last window)? if you want to just bring in young guys okay i get that but deserving is not the right word
logan_matthews9,theoretically if you had a good gauge on your edge you would increase your bet size since your edge also increased. for me i typically find it to be an issue on my end and dont but i see the other side of it
logan_matthews9,maybe it was less about earn your spot and more about get a run out. i agree that he shouldve been with the u20s if he was a borderline guy but i had him firmly as our 3rd striker if he made the team
PikachuBets,make the argument clearer then. read these inane articles by reporters today. conflating wc prize money and uss salaries. its not just a huge wooohooo equal pay baby argument. uss salaries should be higher no question. thats not whats being written as the narrative
PikachuBets,if a tout could ever afford refunding money he wouldnt have needed to tout. this wisconsin brokedick clueless sack of tout aint refunding anyone. neither will he beat close by any meaningful margin. neither will he tweet until he runs hot again. wash  repeat
PikachuBets,he's also been intentionally deceptive multiple times and i've called him out on a lot of it. particularly regarding our $10k bet which he wanted to squeal on then made it look like he didn't. his thirst for attention and praise knows no boundaries
adamchernoff,at this point there are likely questions about service. service is absolutely important but if you nail the other three aspects then phenomenal service becomes a bi-product of speed isolation and continuity (with attitude of the worker mixed in which stems from the culture).
adamchernoff,my take away is that its the other way around. i think both of these offences will be just fine but these defences combined with it being week one magnified things. not downgrading the bears and just a slight upgrade on gb for me.
adamchernoff,"this is going to be great!

one of the sharpest minds in the industry  takes on the ask me anything format of the simple handicap open forum. 

looking forward to chatting with one of the best in the game tonight in the slack channel."
adamchernoff,"virginia tech -6 caps off a 2-0 winning day of college hoops along with illinois +10. here is an example of the  college basketball  content in the simple handicap slack channel.

basketball really starting to click with bet sizes increasing.

join the channel here:"
adamchernoff,"one bet one win. readers of my blog for  cash in on philadelphia dallas over 43 returning 1.00x profit. handicap held true word for word even with the two teams taking 52 minutes to take advantage of the collective mismatch. 

good win for all."
adamchernoff,"indianapolis:

pass o success rate: 14th
rush o success rate: 13th
pass d success rate: 31st
rush d success rate: 19th
o line: 5th
d line: 11th

defensive numbers have come against a very easy slate of opposing offences which concerns me otherwise optimistic."
Ccon8181,yes i follow bambino bets. that is the guy they say i got a guy right? not sure if he moved the line but 1st half moved from -3 to -2.5. a decent advantage play at that number but not strong enough to hit.
Ccon8181,that last touchdown by #toledo with 2 seconds left just cracked any early bettors who took the under 66.5 due to wind factor or those with early knowledge of #fiu qb injury looking to profit. the gambling gods would have none of it. #bahamasbowl
kellyinvegas,when did i say to say utah st buddy? i didnt. never once did i put anything out saying that. i played kent st in half my bowl pools and utah st in the other. i had no opinion on that game either way.
ToddFuhrman,ha scotty theres a lot of things we do but bullshitting isnt one of them. as one of our most loyal listeners think you know how much goes into each podcast and today on  you saw the other side and what gets sacrificed...sleep ha
ToddFuhrman,im actually surprised by twitters response to the gold cup final being a pro mexico crowd in chicago; its not designed to be a world cup qualifier in seattle or columbus giving the #usmnt a hfa and mexico has a much deeper fan base
TheCousinSal,classic  here. he begs me to be in his fantasy league. i say yes because i figure if i agree it will help him look cool in front of his friends and what does he do?  he sticks me with the 12th pick. #moneygrab
TheCousinSal,i feel awful for kd. he took a huge risk and as a result probably forfeited the next year of his career. i mean eventually hell make 40 mm per season again but for now - nothing but respect and compassion for the guy.
TheCousinSal,"it is  a home  home! i cover afc win totals with  on the bullshit podcast + then he and i reviewed the nfc on #againstallodds 
note: i actually forced us to switch studios for no reason just to be a pain in the ass."
TheCousinSal,"my lost wager on the patriots caused me to make some unpatriotic olympic bets:
usa under 10.5 gold medals (+115)
most golds: norway (-150)
canada men win curling gold  (-150)
canada women win curling gold  (even)
mikael kingsbury (canada) wins moguls gold (-200) #gambling"
12Xpert,with this sample it won't be enough with pinny odds. i should imagine like with most things you'll be able to make a profit from soft books but only because one of them almost always has a better price designed to attract new customers.
12Xpert,here's a plot of t-scores which measure the performance deviation away from expectation over 50-bet samples in my wisdom of crowd history. they look pretty symmetrical and normally distributed to me. 67.8 percent  within +/-1 sigma 95.6 percent  within +/- 2 sigma of mean.
12Xpert,"in this sense sharp means ""knows how to exploit things like bog and woc"" which isn't actually very smart but smart enough to get you restricted. in the more specific sense i.e. sharp at a sharp bookie there's hardly any (imo 1 percent )."
12Xpert,that is  certainly a valid view. however i think a more accurate view is that qataris just aren't interested  haven't bothered turning up which then very much makes this about money since what's point in holding it in a country  that is  not interested?
12Xpert,how do you know? why didn't you cry variance! instead of boom! when you were winning last season? why do bettors/tipsters always assume  it is  skill when they are winning and variance/bad luck when they are losing?  it is  just self serving attribution bias.
12Xpert,"""there's a $100 bill on the ground!""
""can't be. if there was somebody would have already picked it up.""

regards fading what makes people believe any systematic bias betting against the square money sits outside of the vig boundaries? (see the economist's joke above.)"
12Xpert,no. im a capitalist and social democrat. thats bottom up built from the risk taking and moralising of individuals to build societies that is greater than the sum of the parts. marxism is top down from the few not the many. it doesnt work.
12Xpert,that would be unreasonably high. but remember for 1x2 there are three possible opportunities for an arb to arise so in fact the total number of possible opportunities was 3 x 50210 matches = 150630. so 16861 as a proportion is 11.2 percent .
12Xpert,but if they failed to adjust it sufficiently they they would simply introduce account restrictions.. but  that is  not going to happen because their model is all about trying to understand what true prices are and managing risks around that too maximise their profit.

RufusPeabody,to be properly equipped to make decisions on whether to buy a half-point or not you need to know the probability the distribution of outcomes and how much each half-point is worth to buy on or buy off. this entirely a quantitative exercise.
RufusPeabody,after 3 straight weeks of the big 6 all having  college football  title odds of 10/1 or better (per  georgia's loss has finally given us some change at the top. alabama's the biggest beneficiary at the top moving up from +232 to +186.
RufusPeabody,this is *not* how we rank the teams. this is based on a combination of things including  ratings (w/o prior) strength of record strength of record strength of schedule games played (w/ 0 losses more is better) and log of margin of victory.
RufusPeabody,new  up where  it is  just  and me. we recap our amazing jinxing prowess and use the nba to touch on outcome-based evaluation before talking about topics from twitter. then i nerd out on golf for a little bit while jeff patiently waits.
jeffma,we have talked critically about prestons days as a tout before and i have talked critically about many people who i am friendly with who sell picks. many of those people are sadly not my friends anymore because i talked critically of them.
jeffma,latest episode of  with where we wallow in the misery of our failed ohio st. futures but bask in the glory of our bama tickets... rufus touts his 6-1 nfl week and we tout our first good supercontest week in a long time!
SportsCheetah,owe the sooners a case of dr. pepper from the factory there in waco. yesterday baylor no playoff was -1430 and minnesota no -1115  2 of the bigger edges i've found in the futures market this season. (yes i know not over yet).
SportsCheetah,aminu harkless and seth curry aren't sexy names but losing them as well and replacing them with hezonja/simons/little minutes seems like a tough ask. whiteside is on the team. 48+ wins is best-case scenario with 80 games from dame imo  even for stotts.
capjack2000,"nj got a lot right but not allowing sportsbook key employees from gambling in the state is one of the more ridiculous ones.

there's a lot of bookmaking talent (myself included) who will never work in this state due to this erroneous reg."
capjack2000,"i'm optimistic they've made improvements. 

previously it was 3 guys making picks and then reacting as the game played out. 

ideas: 
- changes in pace as different players are in/out
- changes in strategy by the margin
- defensive matchups affecting player performance"
capjack2000,"i've seen change. 
- sbtech lowered their vig straddle after it was pointed out how egregious it was.
- oregon lottery is in the process of changing their withholding policy.
- i've seen policy improvements at both pb  wh after talks with them."
capjack2000,"good article here on the allure and the disillusion of parlay betting. 

one nit to pick: nv gaming reports revenue for parlay cards not all parlay wagers (hence the 31 percent  hold rate). nj oddly reports all parlay wagers (hence the lower hold)."
capjack2000,i  daily fantasy sports  usually wade into these types of debates...but that hypothetical is meaningless without context.  it is  not a classic example of would you rather have guaranteed this vs probability of that. development time of nfl pick-player needs to be assessed.
dinkinc,i was being sarcastic  altho at times and with certain trainers it is accurate...  dead on the board not alive in pic 3's ... did you know that computer players only bet certain trainers when they run underlays....  tough game... entertainment only now
dinkinc,1-0 baseball.... 0-1 nfl....  a tough stretch for both the  horses and myself...  mentally exhausted and i  daily fantasy sports  want to enter hockey season like this..will still post baseball but with dead teams emptying their benches with callups i recommend smaller bets...
dinkinc,i dont think my country is the best country.. i dont think my state is the best state.. i dont think my religion is the best religion .. i do think my dog might be the best dog or at least top ten
dinkinc,it toughens you up.... you learn the ropes and the shortcuts...  take the grand central parkway instead of the long island expressway .... stay off of hempstead turnpike during rush hour...  cut people off on the roads... it is  kill or be killed
robpizzola,juve needs to fix this midfield in the summer and aaron ramsey is not the answer. i love dybala but if they have to sell him to bring in a pogba or smssomeone that can drive play forwardthen they have to do it.
robpizzola,aside from an absolute dud (mich/ttu) these were some very entertaining sweet 16 games. elite 8 looks amazing on paper as well. and this is why i root for favorites in the first two rounds of the tourney if im not financially invested.
RASPicks,nfl is still a relatively new market for us and we are well aware of how difficult it can be. it was our third year doing preseason and just our second doing regular season. we may extend it a bit further next year.
RASPicks,"hitting 60 percent  on the radio the last few years likely wasn't a very meaningful sample size.  that alone doesn't move the needle in the debate as to whether or not a ""fade the public"" strategy is good advice for the average bettor."
RASPicks,the evidence tells a different story.  winners can justify selling picks and thrive at it long term. winners even pros at the highest levels can find value in buying picks. with our current release model getting the release line or better is expected.
RASPicks,as a general rule the lowest-limit offerings are the easiest to beat. if you're new to sports betting props would be a good place to start. but beat them consistently enough and you'll (sadly) be shown the door/have limits cut at many places.
VegasRefund,in regards to trading a player... what would be a fair price for a rb demanding big money who is arguably the best at his position whos position is one of the most replaceable and is only three years away from turning 30?
suuma810,"vikings so far:

-run into brick walls on early downs
-only one pa pass
-under center dropbacks with collapsing ol
-dont try to score on 2md
-go to treadwell on third down

the worst one could imagine and they are magically leading 10-9."
suuma810,beautiful play design by kliff kingsbury. this is how you approach 4th  short. spread out the defense: rpo and either you run it into a soft box or throw it to an open charles clay in the flat. it can be so easy.
suuma810,ist schwer zu glauben dass man smith nicht durch die fa oder mit einem pick adquat und billiger ersetzen kann. wie die browns es bei greg robinson gemacht haben ist irgendwie sinnvoller. kann man nach dem ja hour oder schon vorher preiswert cutten.
ClevTA,i mean lets go get brian billick then! im pretty sure it was aaron rodgers who won that sb but if u think it was mccarthy. 1 sb appearance with a top 5 all time qb and none since 2010 isnt exactly impressive
ClevTA,"player matchups for sunday:
- love joe mixon. a big underrated injury on the miami d makes me like the matchup even more
- sutton makes a statement against the secondary which has allowed the highest avg depth of target in the nfl"
ClevTA,huh? army went into oklahoma last year and took them to ot. has nothing to do with coaching. if u are choosing between an academy and any other small school program out of conference id never intentionally choose to face a triple option
ClevTA,"full prediction on standings for 2019 and unlike most previews my wins and losses equal exactly 256 ws  ls

CizzlingSports,he stole groge's work exposing vegas dave for faking rolls of $100's that were really rolls of $1's with a single $100 wrapped around it. he posted groge's work as if it was his own. he did all this after groge passed away.
CizzlingSports,"lol rabbit ears (cc:

spanky,asian outs are the gold mine of outs that every pro wants but very few can get.   is the master of getting them as many asians only like dealing with each other. they used to be way more valuable than they are today.
spanky,"its sad how these assholes at  not only charge -114 but they also make you jump through hoops to get your money.

spanky,"letting spanky bet again.  

i went from being promised 8k on everything to being reduced to house limits (which i had no problem with) to finally being kicked out.

spanky,i never heard of you  public pressure made you do the right thing and refund   how great would it have been had you done the right thing under your own accord.  either way i'm glad you got there.  i hope you learned something!
spanky,a byproduct of the rush to be up and running before football.  the content here is generic. a simple private talk between both bookmakers would have solved the issue.  despite being competitors bookmakers offshore treat each other better than what  just did. sad.

aluckyaday,"i wonder how many he has lost? no mention of long term roi or clv. books must love these stories. i wonder if the actionnetwork will report it when someone loses their house gambling saying i was just trying to emulate ""parlay patz"""
aluckyaday,if you want to see something similar in action check out  wisdom of the crowd. and before anyone asks no i'm not on commission. its just a great publically available example of how using information found in the market can lead to profits.
aluckyaday,the two bets in question were man of steel (you were right it is similar to league mvp by the sport was rugby league not soccer) and for the team he played for to finish in the top 5 of the league. 2/x
aluckyaday,"i think you will find limits become a even tighter for ""sharps"" once they have built up their recreational/addict player base! the limits i see you americans complain about seem huge to  me. although i guess they are not usually for prop markets."
aluckyaday,"today's wisdom of the crowd football lucky15 prices with bet365 who give bonuses on football luckies

wycombe v portsmouth portsmouth at 29/20"
aluckyaday,its their business let them run them how they want to! bet at the place with terms and conditions that suit you. imposing minimum limits would be detrimental to recreational bettors but favour line chasers. then again i guess you know that already
aluckyaday,yep. but so is europe. not all recreational bettors bet $20. plus you have the cross selling of casinos bingo etc. they know the numbers and how much to spend per customer. i think 365 was 55 billion turnover at the last count!
aluckyaday,that is interesting. so money they know is not from a sharp source is ignored as they know they will win from that long term anyway. isn't the problem with doing that that you are not maximizing your profit from the public money?
joeytunes2,it is  hard to get limits on app. yes i orginate and yes i'm in contact everyday with guys want my work and get there's down. the apps are still good. window limits aren't that great for pros. so rather work 6 apps
joeyisaks,federers stats arent good this tournament and his 2 year grass stats doesnt warrant him being a favorite vs nadal who has very good grass stats this tournament and last year.. not even factoring in matchup and their recent meeting 5 weeks ago
EdMillerPoker,only thing id add is i dont really think you can force it. either you have the drive or you dont but either way it doesnt start with some guy on twitter said i should work a ton of hours in my 20s.
EdMillerPoker,always think  it is  super misleading when people talk about parlays having double digit house edge... they have similar house edge to any other sports bet but they multiply the effective volume so a $5 3-team parlay is really a roughly $15 bet
EdMillerPoker,"if you like betting on college basketball you'll want to be at  from now through march. we'll be posting halftime lines on most games and real in-play lines on lots of games all season long.

you can also tweet requests for game coverage"
EdMillerPoker,id be lying if i said i was sure what the fallout will be. we dont out much specific stuff. my hope is it has at least a minor influence on making the industry more bettor-friendly as it rolls out in more states.
EdMillerPoker,this would suggest the -180 moneyline bet might be better because the lines imply only about 12 percent  but the data suggests around 14 percent  so if the future follows the past you get a couple extra wins than you are paying for
EdMillerPoker,unless you're broke you're almost certainly better off $-wise self-publishing and then hiring someone to promote for you. like i almost can't imagine a scenario where going thru a publisher turns out better $-wise unless you  daily fantasy sports  earn out your advance.
EdMillerPoker,it all depends on whether the high hold burn em out model flourishes (with the lotto options being extreme case of this) or whether a low hold well designed in play product emerges as market standard. could swing mature handle by many x.

LockyLockerson,i bricked the heisman because i couldn't come up with joe burrow despite the trail of breadcrumbs which ultimately led many smart people to bet him at long odds.  something for me to work on next year in addition to many other things!
LockyLockerson,"so you  daily fantasy sports  have to look it up here was the top 6 in mvp voting last year: giannis harden pg jokic curry lillard.

embiid finished 7th kawhi 9th lebron tied for 11th.  ben simmons did not factor into the voting."
LockyLockerson,"heisman thread entering week 1:

here are the top candidates in the market for the heisman entering this week and their team's total points expected in the market.  obviously one aspect to winning the heisman is crazy stats (which is related to scoring)."
LockyLockerson,"thank you again for the pre-orders yesterday.  8 days to the release!

after all your support we have officially moved 2 spots ahead of a book about using astrology to bet on sports.  as a leo i can't believe we've climbed this mountaintop."
LockyLockerson,"your 2nd sentence is what i am saying. i think the idea of trying to quantify ""i  daily fantasy sports  like willie taggart and i think he's bad"" is sort-of masking the good things that are still there. like...talent. a lot of talent."
LockyLockerson,yes i agree with at least the general outline of this.  i'm fine pushing back against specifics but the idea of just generally letting more teams in or generally increasing the number of playoff games/series doesn't really seem bad at all to me.
LockyLockerson,well based on red-zone percentage i'm guessing betting deebo 1st  touchdown  or deebo 1st niners  touchdown  would be valuable if you had this opinion.  not a perfect correlation to what you're talking about but could do it.  deebo anytime  touchdown  also a possibility.

DannyParkins,so silver lebron or anyone with the nba making a business decision with china and deciding they cant end communism or free hong kong doesnt cheapen their championing of domestic causes they care about like gay rights black lives matter or lebrons school.
DannyParkins,no it isn't. i said he wasn't using it as a racial slur as the pitcher who hit him isn't black. i said it can be used as a term of endearment not that ta was using it as such on the field.
Gingfacekillah,i see some long term positives for the pistons with this. cap space sure. picking a definitive direction (tanking) sure. most importantly though this is hopefully a move long term towards playing successful modern era ball and getting away from stagnant post play.
Gingfacekillah,calculate each teams expected possessions (using provided formula). calculate league average possessions. determine how many possessions the teams in question are above or below the average. (eg. boston 2.3 above average). then team 1 factor + team 2 factor + lg. average poss.
logan_matthews9,only thing that kept me from the over is that 0-0 1-0 1-1 2-1 either way are all great scores for lafc and a team thats out of shape might like to take their foot off the gas with a score they like

PikachuBets,"such a fucking swindling liar lol. nothing about this trainwreck has been transparent. the cohnreznick letter was a fucking joke. real fucking transparency when you can pay a sympathetic company to receive a spreadsheet and automatically sign off on it for ""accountability"" lol"
PikachuBets,no it doesnt you simpleton. literally no attention needs to be paid for random nuisance suits filed. there are motion to dismiss templates online. any monkey could write one and i touchdown  take 2-3 weeks to tide over. get a clue holy jeez
PikachuBets,no youre wrong. line only came up at 9:40a wasnt 1k on sides until around 10:30a. it opens at 250 quickly goes to 500 stays there for a whole. either way 1k is nowhere near an opener. and no they dont collar accounts
adamchernoff,not saying it is right or wrong to do. im just saying i prefer not to bet into markets with extremely high margins at very disadvantageous prices. you could find +ev occasionally i just prefer to focus on better markets to bet into.
adamchernoff,"instant reaction to nfl week 2 openers from   and i. we touch on the prices as they hit the board  as well look through notes from the traders on the other side of the operation on where they expect prices to go.

Ccon8181,this call goes against us 9 out of 10... the one time we need it. or just call incomplete pass. it goes for fumble and return to blow #titans cover at +3.5 ... another reminder why do i bet on this league #nfl
Ccon8181,just backing the numbers... rams going in were good against the run poor verse pass. baltimore is a running team. rams positive defensive efficiency verse run plus some value on inflated line. plus good situational spot.... but obviously wrong side in the end

ToddFuhrman,dvond...appreciate you being a loyal listener all these years.  when we give out the best bet we make sure the price is available at a number of shops; +3 (-120) was all over vegas and a few offshores most of thursday post release.
ToddFuhrman,"been looking to buy a copy of that; brendan you got a guy?

depends on what kind of reads you're looking for in the space...some of the theory stuff is rather dense but we've published a few reading lists  for gambling related reading"
TheCousinSal,"the giants shouldve never benched eli...shut up 

the giants are the best team in the nfc east...shut up

the giants play with more heart than every other team in the nfl shut up

shut up
shut up
shut up
shut up 
shut up"
TheCousinSal,when it comes to red flags surrounding this new england team...the aging quarterback...the woefully inefficient offense...the all of a sudden erratic defense - all pale in comparison to the fact that the patriots feel the need to illegally record the 1-12 cincinnati bengals!!!
TheCousinSal,"so  fractures his ankle after falling at home   is cuffed in vegas after an assault. just waiting for tmz to report that  busted his collarbone during a parkour competition to make it a clean sweep of misery for all of my ""sports"" heroes."
TheCousinSal,"my 12 year-old re jr smith at the end of regulation....

holy crap. 
1. he could have just put it back up
2. he could have passed the ball to lebron
3. or he could have showed up to the game not high"
TheCousinSal,the flat out drops by wrs on 1 and 2 seeds are baffling. i get they may be out of sync but dont they still practice? it seems as if everyone who had the week off spent it on a different tropical island.
12Xpert,here's data from my old skybet affiliate acccount (at the time i downloaded it there were 857 players. 50 percent  of net revenue comes from 3.6 percent  of them. i think the sample size will be broadly representative of the wider player population.
12Xpert,"so maybe your 25 was a little unlucky. about 1 in 15.

just to explain my monte carlo assumed odds of 3.03 for all bets. you run one with your actual odds and see how it compares (if you can be bothered )"
12Xpert,was looking for a referee bias. hypothesis: a referee is disproportionately more likely to balance up yellow cards in a match so home - away = 0 would be disproportionately more common than expected. referees would appear to be unbiased on this measure.
12Xpert,"man u were 3 five times away last season. they won one of those (but they ain't big anymore). man city were never 3. liverpool were 3.84 away to man city. they lost.

just not enough matches to make this a meaningful sample."
12Xpert,and once we've done that we can have a debate about how best to manage it. i tend to think that denial and prohibition carried by flimsy moral arguments is usually not very effective. again war on drugs is a case in point.
12Xpert,easy to be fooled by small samples but a priori i would say your reasoning is pretty reasonable. efficient books will be more efficient for bigger leagues. softer books arguably will be more tempted to offer more tempting inefficient prices for those leagues.
12Xpert,and no. you can't win 45 percent  through skill unless the skill under scrutiny is deliberately trying to lose but most people are rational and prefer not to do that so we  daily fantasy sports  need to consider that tail of the bell-curve.
12Xpert,"my wocs system cannot possibly work because squares are this dumb to force bookmakers to offer thousands of loss leading prices. recreational bookmakers do this to attract new customers by selling the ""we offer great prices"" message. then they ban for regular exploitation"

mschwimer,of the 15 teams in the al the top 6 that use data analytics imo are rays astros yankees a's twins and red sox.  5 of the 6 in the playoffs.  it is no coincidence.  when will other owners in other sports learn?
mschwimer,over the course of our very brief history we have provided financial value to our subs. that is an indisputable fact. other touts do not provide financial value to their subs. that is the difference. and those are the facts. not an opinion.
mschwimer,last weeks podcast we gave out our game of the week (jags) winner and 8 props for the thursday night game.  went 5-3.  this podcast has our gotw as well as 8 more props for the jags/titans game.  tune into our 15min podcast!
mschwimer,martin. its hard for them to understand. you have seen it. they havent. which is why my suggestion is to simply register for free and you can see it all for yourself. over time you will be able to understand what we do.
mschwimer,update.  after speaking with our legal team they brought up a great point. very hard to adequately respond to questions in 240 characters.  please send all legal questions to  (contact) and i guarantee a response time of 24 hours from our legal team.
mschwimer,now that is what im talking about! finally someone that understands sample size. for us to have the record we have over as many picks as we have we would need to be lucky on more than a 1 out of 100000 scale.
RufusPeabody,"it is  happened to me way too many times over the years to be coincidence.

i remember 10 years ago trying to bet a super bowl prop at harrah's at +130 and the bet being rejected and the line moved to -120."
RufusPeabody,important to note that being able to beat the sports betting market does not mean you can best predict the outcome. it doesnt even mean youre better than the betting line. it means your predictions add *something* to the prediction. big difference.
RufusPeabody,im happy to debate it but youve said nothing to suggest you have an argument so whats the point of having you on the pod? its football season and we have a lot to cover. if you have points please make them.
RufusPeabody,i went to sleep bud. i  daily fantasy sports  see much of an issue with the bj team. are you saying card counting isn't allowed or communicating secretly while a hand isn't going on isn't allowed or the combination of the two.
RufusPeabody,for simplicity's sake i was talking about spread market where the baseline is 50 percent . but the point is the same -- if you faded the big moneyline picks the juice is large enough that you wouldn't be expected to win.
RufusPeabody,heres the plan: worst of sports media 64-person bracket announced on selection sunday. seeding will be based on frequency of mentions in tweets below. may also separate by sports media sub-type. head to head matchups (polls) will run concurrently with ncaa tournament.
SportsCheetah,never won back-to-back before maybe ill start laying -1400s and ill have a shot. thats why they pay him the big bucks... so he can put out plays that require you to risk 40 percent  more than the bankroll you even have.
SportsCheetah,i had a spiritual experience watching the mavericks and luka today. i even went to church today too. the next couple of moves they make will likely have the biggest impact on the league for the next decade. no pressure  and co.
SportsCheetah,"i drank too many dr. peppers tonight. missed a chunk of 4 games on board. someone also reminded me i forgot oregon -22 friday night game from last week's recap so 23-24 there.

capjack2000,"you're absolutely correct. we've seen it time and again in the sports wagering rfp world. you make offers that have no long-term sustainability because your company isn't concerned about long-term sustainability. 

you want the quick buck and then acquisition by another company."
capjack2000,"hey  (and  on this promo where we can bet if colin cowherd can pick 3 of 5 games correctly how about letting us also bet if he can't at +100. 

hint:  it is  the same odds so it wouldn't cost you anything."
capjack2000,"there used to be a book in a far-away place that used to refund your wager if you lost to a no-hitter.  

i agree bonus payout on a no-no should be a thing in nj and i'm surprised  it is  not yet."
capjack2000,"the njdge works based upon preponderance of evidence. therefore the sportsbook only needs to prove a 51 percent  probability that the player violated their terms. 

chances are that ruling will be made before the player has the opportunity to retain counsel.  7/9"
capjack2000,"i'm not buying that excuse. first there is no pa operator reinventing mobile app betting. the first-movers all have existing apps in nj. streamlines the approval process.

second every operator would say web-based and android-only would be better than none at all."
capjack2000,"i agree with you. however the practicality of that would lead to even more confusion not less. the paradigm shift will eventually occur when non-gaming companies get into offering sports wagering. 

then well see the decoupling of traditional casino/lottery and sports wagering"
capjack2000,theoretically they could. however if they pursue a revenue sharing agreement with a nj book (loss percent ) they have to endure a very strict thorough background check. im not sure theyll be able to successfully structure themselves to play both sides.
robpizzola,the reality is that juve has been complete dog shit this season and somehow getting results. this was going to happen eventually although i thought they were good up until the red. either way this team is going nowhere with this midfield.
robpizzola,another low key great move if the kids arrive in a group and one of them has a shitty costume... give that kid one single piece of candy and give all the friends a handful. you really gotta emphasize that handful though.
suuma810,"some great #bengals insights by  he expects zac taylor to run the #rams offense with lots of 11 personnel pa and outside zone. john ross to be used on jet sweeps and screens. 

qb should be an interesting topic come draft time."
suuma810,"only four games since week 10 including ari bal  oak:

45 percent  vs pass on 3rd down
40 percent  vs pass on 3rd  5+

can't get home rush dvoa but their success rate vs run at home over the season is dead-last."
suuma810,die broncos haben keinen qb eine schwache ol und die defense hat lcher bzw. befindet sich 2019 evtl. im rebuild. der grte punkt ist fr mich aber john elway. alleine dass er gerchten zufolge dem neuen hc kubiak als oc aufzwingen will.
suuma810,the #steelers are 14-24 against the spread (36.8 percent ) as road favorites of more than 3 points under mike tomlin. the rest of the league is 241-218-9 (52.5 percent ) over that span. pittsburgh is currently a -5.5 favorite at cleveland.
ClevTA,brissett has a really good history v hou but  thursday night football  is so quirky that we see clunkers on offense a lot. baker has an ideal matchup and between landry revenge gm + getting obj off u have to go baker
CizzlingSports,"oof a $300-betting sub that purchased a  1-week package for 10/8 - 10/14 needed a $12271.00 bankroll (assuming all bets at -110) and lost -$2620.00.

but s/he is due a $300.00 refund.

because when a sub looses jambos looses.

 it is  fine."
CizzlingSports,yeah i just want jambos to keep ignoring that the guarantee is illusory no matter how many bank letters are posted and as long as subscribers have to front a $1500 filing fee and costs to travel to and litigate in md
spanky,lets be clear...  came at me saying hes dominated totals longer than me.  furthermore he went on to insult me cuz i didnt know players names.  i dont troll anyone...  just had to keep things real and bring him down to earth..
spanky,today is my  banishment anniversary. cant believe a year has passed since i came on here.  a few cell phone banishment videos two podcasts and a  story was plenty for me.  glad to be able to reach out way beyond industry insiders.
spanky,just finished reading  and  book the logic of sports betting.  i thoroughly enjoyed it and think beginner to intermediate bettors will benefit.  i picked out a top 10 great lines from the book that i'll elaborate on below (in no particular order)...
spanky,at the #bosamerica conference several panelists mentioned they want to get rid of the black offshore market if that ever happened their systems would malfunction providing no lines on any games since their software would have no one to copy from. #fact
spanky,kudos to  and  for going up first and taking 10k pops. double kudos for not taking the numbers down (like many other lv joints do) when betcris hangs up their numbers.   should be on the forefront of national expansion. a bookmakers bookmaker
spanky,i've run out of videos and letters to share as i've been banned practically everywhere.  hopefully someone out there can help us sharp players and aspiring sharp players and develop legislation to give us a fair shake... i just want to bet
spanky,"december revenue report says alot:
1.)  is #1 retail sports book in nj (earning a mill more than all other nj shops combined)
2.) ac retail sportsbooks are very fragile.  given the opportunity someone like me could solely alter their entire month."
spanky,its so convenient for these guys to try and use my background as the reason for booting me. please be real. youre all wanna be bookmakers who dont know what the f*ck youre doing so you take the easy way out... nauseating
PlusEVAnalytics,what sealed the deal for me was there was a store selling gay christmas lights and i remember thinking to myself what is it about these christmas lights that makes them gay? they were the same colours as my dads new shirt.
PlusEVAnalytics,so the argument is essentially that assuming you have a +ev position to begin with multi accounts allow you to get more action down. i buy that but you would run into diminishing returns - and more quickly on a short slate.
aluckyaday,taxation is a little different to changing contract law. it benefits the government for one. should they really introduce a law that would be detrimental to the majority of consumers? i think enforcing advertising standards more strictly would be a better solution.
aluckyaday,being a recreational sharp is not that difficult hence why they need to restrict.  just look at pinnacle lines remove the vig and back anything that is bigger with a soft book. you will turn a profit if you can get on
aluckyaday,they  daily fantasy sports  really need them. states are after tax revenue. the softbook model is the most profitable out there.... but the question of problem gamblers will arise at some point. is the tax revenue worth the damage to individuals lives?
aluckyaday,yep. they are weak by choice as it allows them to maximize their profits managing liabilities by restricting accounts. in a perfect world there would only be one price as arbers would bring all the non restricting sharp books in to line!
aluckyaday,"""he added that bookmakers in his area didnt go over 150 percent  suggesting that bookmakers in the sp sample did less of a job offering value to bettors."" i do wonder sometimes how anonymous the books used for sp returns really are."
aluckyaday,i wonder how many of the 170000 new accounts were genuine? 80 free money hmmmm. guess we will see come royal ascot if that promotion has been put to bed for ever. will be interesting to see what they do at aintree.
joeyisaks,im supposed to be in itsly in 2 weeks and have encountered a lot of no refund policies. its crazy.. not even asking a refund just to reschedule for when i can actually be allowed to travel there and they wont budge

EdMillerPoker,"as soon as you know someone will lie to further their interests  it is  not constructive to invite them to a

debate

to hear ""their viewpoint"" or ""their side of the story.""

they just fucking lie."
EdMillerPoker,"though i have no idea exactly how those lines will be drawn from a legal perspective. i think more people today are worried about the raw data rights and ""unofficial"" data collection and for me there's no argument of bad faith there..."
EdMillerPoker,i think one persons bad business is another persons good customer (in gambling this can be true to a massive extent) and that systematic and particularly heavy-handed culling of bad business will make competitive cracks that small operators can enter and exploit
GolcondaFund,"dear god the rams gameplan is to avoid a highlight reel lj game guaranteeing such a game by not attacking.

4 drives 4  touchdown s...might as well 0 blitz every down and give your d less time on the field.

#analytics #nfl"
nonrandomalpha,they also provide a lot of free content most of which (certainly not all) is both entertaining and valuable to both novice and professional bettors. if you want to buy picks on the cheap i suspect  is one of the better options...
nonrandomalpha,"#nfl preseason week 1 betting market snapshot: 

#cowboys v #niners: most popular game bet (1038 tickets) 

#patriots v #lions: largest average bet size of $350/ticket moving the opening line 5.5 points from lions+3 to -2.5. bettors that chased the steam got crushed"
LeeSharpeNFL,"attempts is also a volume stat. ideally you'd use expected points added/dropback but even something like yards/attempt is much better than looking just yards or just attempts.

(also ""momentum"" isn't predictive of anything and the success of passing doesn't depend on running.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"ehhh this seems like a solid flex. there are no other games to choose from between two likely playoff teams.

if hou loses tonight i could see hou/ten as a potential afc south championship of sorts but there's really no great game."
LeeSharpeNFL,"thanks to  and  for chatting with me earlier this week about mixed-effects modeling and pointing me at some stuff using/referencing it.

JoeyKnish22,"the long  touchdown  streak is over. 

am i sad? yes.

it is mostly  fault. also yes.

JoeyKnish22,i could tweet vegas dave is a scam artist every 5 minutes from now until 2030. it aint gonna cost him a dime. its just gonna cost me time wasted in my life that i could be spending happy/productive/literally doing anything else.
JoeyKnish22,yeah way too much politics going on there. here the support was almost completely bipartisan and unanimous. also theres an existing gaming infrastructure here + whitmer is very close with the casino industry (her governor victory celebration was at motor city lol).
JoeyKnish22,maybe some voter fatigue on donald. hes won 2 in a row rams surging a bit and hes probably still the best defensive player in the league but not sure he wins 3 straight (has never happened in history of the award).
JoeyKnish22,planning to go live soon eddie baby dont mind the fine print (100x deposit roll and 40 cent lines) youll love it. also if you see any early negative reviews out there fake ppl will say anything on the internet these days.
JoeyKnish22,"on a lighter note. if youre interested in some blood money.  was all business after the news drop and put hill most receiving yards +2000 on the radar. available at a couple shops.

Gingfacekillah,a forecast represents a mean expectation so it makes sense to qualify it with subjective human factors that would suggest whether its likely a given team will meet or fail to perform at that level. you sweet spot is approx. ranking 6-10.
Gingfacekillah,safe to say mia is torched on this one. possible factors: 3pt shooting variance in favour of tor and some difficulty on my part forecasting tor player minutes. going to take a look at the minutes and see where it went wrong.
logan_matthews9,looks like this will go off at 145 so some decent value but morales on the bench is a disappointment. ream is actually better for this at lb and zardes instead of sargent means its unlikely the us jumps out in front
logan_matthews9,because of the massive amount of plays a bad week like they had makes this almost unsustainable for your average bettor. if your bankroll was $10000 for example - you couldnt get down all the recommendations for the rest of the month
logan_matthews9,jesus he was on the u20 world cup squad. this is pure bashing - 17 year olds who arent good enough for the nt shouldnt be getting special calls from the coach just because they are dual nationals. thats a terrible precedent
logan_matthews9,charlotte is 16th but yes cavs are bad. that said theyve only scored over 226 three times in eight games - two of which were against the hawks who play at the fastest pace in the league (two were also with love)

oh wait you dont have any clients you fool thats why you had to drop the price loooooooool"
PikachuBets,yeah and then i had alba berlin pk today from 2 days ago which moved to +2 and they crushed by 11 but i forgot to post bc i didnt know it was a morning game today lol. gambling gods no chill

adamchernoff,im canadian so i probably shouldnt know this but chicago is called the windy city because politicians in the 20-30s talked a lot not because there is actually more wind in the city  on a daily basis than elsewhere in the country.
adamchernoff,"wow. expected ogletree and davis but a surprise inactive lorenzo carter adds to the handicap.

giants starting lb's today  snaps played in 2019:

stupar 2 (acquired this week)
ximines 113 (5th round rookie)
mayo 41
skipper 25 (undrafted rookie)
ballentine 9 (rookie)"
adamchernoff,"i cant hear you

3rd and 4 at the opponent 35 and he nearly didnt get the snap off because he had zero idea of what play to switch into and mcvay couldnt read the defence for him and call the play."
adamchernoff,if it works he has potential to be the top receiver in the league. if it doesnt they still have one of the best rosters in the nfl they have the spine to suspend and cut him and lose $9m. thats that.
adamchernoff,"back at it!

adamchernoff,visitors can expand each game to see details. it will break down the hitter vs starter and bullpen matchup adjust for park then produce projected hits. using a regression over the past 35000 games the projected hit total will produce projected runs.
adamchernoff,initial impression is that the price is low like you pointed out due to the market beginning to sell the most over performing team finishing at unsustainable rate. not sure i agree with the selling in this spot. seems you dont either?

TheCousinSal,i'm in a fantasy league with pro poker players who just bet each other 1k on their week one matchup. cbs sports projections dictate the spread. never met them but they automatically fall in my top 10 best friends of all-time. #degenerates
TheCousinSal,quick update-on my #againstallodds podcast we gave out joe harris (8/1) to win the 3 pt. contest  kevin durant (10/1) to win mvp. to be fair  said martin laird (dead last place) would finish in the top 20 at the genesis open.
12Xpert,but the point is we  daily fantasy sports  know whether these high rolling players are much more likely to be addicts (11 times more likely).  and  just say  it is  a secret source.  that is  not science. but it might be bs.
12Xpert,until you show me a credible source that demonstrates addicts account for the majority of profits of the gambling sector then everything that the likes of the  and  and labour mps say on this topic can be assumed to be anecdotal moralising.
12Xpert,obviously calculator is suited for simple bet scenarios with the sames odds and stakes but i've tested it against monte carlo and  it is  reasonably robust provided odds or stakes  daily fantasy sports  vary too much for example asian handicap/point spread betting.
12Xpert,evidently aimed at me. have the decency to tag me next time. you have much to offer but your personal criticism is unpleasant. you pretend to know a lot about me when in fact you haven't the slightest idea just making presumptions.
12Xpert,yes i agree with all of that. it will be nigh on impossible to make this a perfect study. however my general point still stands. if a bookmaker's closing prices make better predictions of outcomes what is the point of other predictions?
12Xpert,i did spend considerable time making sure the team names were matching and that the two data sets were properly correlated. if there were any residual discrepancies then these will not have been included in the sample for example for awarded games.
12Xpert,"good effort. i think it implies it sucks relative to pinny. isn't this further support for wisdom of crowd? ok so we might be simply talking ""crowd of pinny traders plus some sharp customers"" but  it is  still considerably bigger than 538."

mschwimer,not true.  the public has been able to verify all my pick recommendations that have gone into the numbers i cited.  all against betcris line. think about it.  imagine what #gamblingtwitter would do if we falsified any of our publicly available picks.
mschwimer,its ok. i give you complete credit for being honest and publicly admitting you do not want to debate this publcily because you know i will win. it really does show class and honor. i have a lot of respect for that.
mschwimer,i would say he has to prove he believes what he says. but that is just my opinion. again im more than happy if he no longer believes it and wants to take it back. would be no hard feelings at all.
mschwimer,we get all our lines from . all our picks are time stamped and we reference the book that had the line. the only way we would ever put in a bad line is if  published one. i will look into it.
RufusPeabody,raw yards per play doesn't properly account for context. expected points added handles down/dist/field pos but adds noise by giving too much wgt (from a predictive standpoint which is all i'm interested in) to turnovers and high leverage (3rd/4th down) plays.
RufusPeabody,what is the english translation of the letter ? would it be a e or ae? haven't needed it yet but after dealing with enough    and  thought it was time to make a more complete unicode dictionary in my golf code.
RufusPeabody,aside from the public nature of it all (involving average joes  overpromising) what makes it different than an originator (i hate that word) getting accounts from people where he gets a percentage (typical betting partner arrangement) and having a losing year?
RufusPeabody,i think cville in general. but i will say that the people gill has on his podcast are closer to vegas dave than dr. bob. if you sell picks without providing any meaningful documentation of long-term record you deserve the criticism.
SportsCheetah,it is  funny seeing pats fans whine about this but it was also funny betting against them over the years and seeing every call go their way and finally betting the pats today and watching it all unfold to kc's side.
capjack2000,thanks rex it was the total i was curious about. i was looking at that game at the time and saw it flash red with a new price every couple seconds before settling back to close to where it was before.
capjack2000,"hmmm...time to welcome  to #gamblingtwitter. 

 let us  start with what pa got right:
they achieved the holy grail of plugging a huge budget deficit with gambling expansion (with those $30m fees that most operators paid).

what they got wrong:
everything else."
capjack2000,"thanks for the shoutout on  podcast this week  and  the nice thing about g2e is that you can get an expo hall pass for free through plenty of various exhibitors. 

therefore the barrier to entry is much lower for industry enthusiasts."
capjack2000,"its a pretty nifty trick: get approved by njdge to get a  percent  of losses of players you refer and then acquire a bunch of feeder companies for cash. 

those feeders probably couldnt have passed the rigid approval on their own."
capjack2000,nv has made that shift away from being gambling-centric. i agree the future of sports betting makes it less of a destination event but outside of a couple times a year it was never the main draw for lv tourism anyway.
capjack2000,"the process in nj takes roughly 2 years and requires key employee license status for most of the employees of the affiliate site (ie: intrusive background check that the applicant pays for).

not everyone is comfortable with that level of intrusion."
capjack2000,i finished reading then one day...by  great read! my favorite part was the epilogue. in an industry where nobody dares burn bridges chris calls out a few offenders in a very classy and nameless way. a perfect dose of humanity imo.

robpizzola,this guy just comes back over and over under different ghost accounts saying the same thing over and over... all because i refused to dm him my picks. thanks for the support hayden but better off just ignoring his sad existence.
robpizzola,wasnt a fan of allegri but sarri is making him look like the best manager of all time. berna cant play this role behind the strikers. pjanic as a regista is way too predictable and midfield just lacks creativity in general.
robpizzola,"i'm going to summon my inner rj bell and darren rovell here:

if pinnacle let you parlay nhl exact series prices (i  daily fantasy sports  think they do) a columbus in 4 and islanders in 4 parlay would have paid $90549."
robpizzola,you really have to admire how dumb these old coaches are. there is a massive difference between playing vegas or arizona/minnesota/colorado/chicago in the first round. can't imagine how anyone wouldn't want to do everything possible to win the pacific right now.

suuma810,cool first episode truly enjoyed it. lbs are the rbs of the defense was a funny but also interesting nugget that had me thinking! cant wait for the next episodes and wish that you can get sashi on it one time.
suuma810,total yards depends on the amounts of runs/scrambles faced. if you dont face guys like lamar or josh allen total yards wont be high. but when qbs ran against the bolts they had a success rate of 62 percent  on average.
suuma810,as explained in the write-up great sell high spot on the jets off monday night football  blowout against an atrocious lions team. dolphins are underrated. my line was dolphins -2 lookahead was pk. great value  mia took care of business. #finsup
suuma810,"nfl #betting tip 9:

forget all preseason scores after next week. you can look at individual performances during starter play and team tendencies to shape your ratings but  that is  pretty much it. the scores are largely irrelevant for week one."
ClevTA,mcdaniels was never working with dorsey. stefanski + gannon or mcdaniels + gannon are your most likely options for hc/dc. maybe a 3rd young unkown emerges that depo likes similar to mcdermott or stefanski but i dont know who that is
ClevTA,rams were -1.5/2 on the lookahead just last week so a 3/3.5 point swing only based on one bad gm  no injury is a healthy flip. maybe its valid but the perception has definitely changed very quickly is all im saying
ClevTA,bears had the best dvoa defensive ranking last year in the nfl since 2012. they currently are 5th and still have mack hicks trevathean fuller floyd etc. calm down guys im not going out on some crazy limb. stop nitpicking everything
CizzlingSports,"well so far jambos has: 1) ignored its fees when touting past performance; 2) ignored overall performance in favor of subsets; 3) ignored bankroll management; 4) made grandiose claims of taking the tout industry by storm

so  i do not know"
CizzlingSports,"he claims he has 1000's of vip subscribers 

and he's quick to remind you that they dont necessarily buy for the picks bc they also get an autographed copy of his book a t-shirt and invites to special vip events lol"
CizzlingSports,"subscribers who bought the  1-week package for the first week of the nfl season (9/3-9/9) and bet the recommended $300/game lost -$5881.00 ($250 fee + $5931.00 in losses -$300 reimbursement)

they also needed a $11119.00 bankroll for that one week.

ouch."
CizzlingSports,".this is exactly what  did on sat with the uf ""blood bank"" under play. thumped his chest because u50.5 was available to the world for 1.5 hours on wed. and available to pa/nj residents on sat. for a $100 limit lol."
CizzlingSports,well she's employed at least in part by a fraud tout operation that sells losing sports betting picks  that is  run by a guy who just burned through an entire bankroll in 30 days' time selling losing mlb plays. not kidding.
spanky,"the sportsbooks love it for the free publicity.  unfortunatelymost of the flexes are fake flexers when it comes to booking anybody that has a clue.  

they book $250000 from a recreational bettor but wont book $250 from a sharp bettor. 

#beabookmakernotadressmaker"
spanky,hey   how are guys like  writing for  calling me a loser cuz i dont know football players names? where did this guy come from? he calls himself mr over/under?!? he probably has trouble walking over a sidewalk and under the sun.
spanky,lol. maybe try and originate your software. well known you stole asi code. you say dgs is terrible yet 95 percent  of the offshore world use it.  you guys are not even the original knockoffs. youre the knockoff of the knockoffs.
spanky,i tweeted that i wanted to visit  on january 14th. i just got a certified letter dated january 16th banning me.  my undesirable behavior is winning too much!?! i never even stepped foot in the joint! regulated bookmaking in america sucks!
spanky,to any aspiring pro bettors out there: higher self sufficiency yields better results. many bookmakers and bettors today were crippled without donbest and literally shut down. i love donbest but we have our own in-house-built line monitor which donbest supplements.  (1/2)
spanky,not only is  unable to book me they are also unable to accept my feedback on how they should not be welcome to book in the united states.  permanently banning winning customers may be a european standard but is simply un-american!
PlusEVAnalytics,not saying this was all a set up...but if youre 85 and have had enough and youre a known gigantic bigot how do you want to end your career? with people eating cake and singing for hes a jolly good fellow???
PlusEVAnalytics,time for some game theory. wife wants me to watch this with her. the show is on for like 8 weeks. titans/jags is one of the shittiest possible  thursday night football  games. i have money on the under. whats the play?
PlusEVAnalytics,its a good question that does not have a single answer. even the 4 percent  figure alone does not tell you whether adding the 4 percent  improves the prediction by a little or by a lot just that it improves it.
PlusEVAnalytics,im not an expert in the mechanics of  daily fantasy sports ...tell my why this makes such a big difference? sure its 150 out of the 10000 entries that are guaranteed not to match yours that cant be worth that much?
aluckyaday,i think this is a punter perception thing. their bet gets rejected after the delay and they assume it is their bet that caused the price to move. see a few complaints on here that make this most likely wrong assumption!
aluckyaday,points betting is not new. it has been in the uk since the 1980s. confusing though because we brits call it spread betting. in the uk i think the spread betting firms have managed to remain independent so there is hope!
aluckyaday,which i believe is basically what  has done . if he does turn out to have valuable information the likes of spanky will be able to use their network of outs to get on something not available to your average joe.
aluckyaday,"seattle seahawks at pittsburgh steelers back seattle seahawks +4 (+4)
dallas cowboys at washington redskins back washington redskins +6 (+5)
chicago bears at denver broncos back denver broncos +2 (+2.5)
cleveland browns at new york jets back cleveland browns -6.5 (-2.5)"
aluckyaday,which seems like a reasonable conclusion for the government to make. but if does not solve the underlying problem. neither will targeting online casinos. in my opinion online casinos are a much bigger risk as it is done behind closed doors.
aluckyaday,but somebody else having +ev does not stop me having +ev. you queried why someone would bet and be able to profit from a market where there are insiders. i have explained how that is perfectly possible in uk horse racing.
aluckyaday,agreed but as most people are getting restricted because they are taking meaningless early prices that would most likely not exist under a mbl system most restricted people would be no better off. but recreational punters would be significantly worse off.
aluckyaday,the issue comes when a sharp book has to compete with a soft book for the losers. the soft books gives recreational players what they want. many props and offers. they choose the soft book over the sharp all day long.
EdMillerPoker,"yeah i heard about those lobby h2h sniping scripts and  that is  obv very poor community-breaking behavior. like to me  that is  ""scripting.""

really just wish instead of focusing on the means (a ""script"") the focus had been on the behavior."
EdMillerPoker,the synthetic zero hold market gives you substantial information about the availability and nature of +ev bets that you dont have if everyone in the market just has the same price. its a flashing sign saying +ev bet over here somewhere.
EdMillerPoker,complicated answer but ill try in a tweet or two. what vegas has is established but fragile because its built on top of dependencies that will likely be changing and/or disappearing next couple years due to overall changes in the industry.
EdMillerPoker,i havent so far detected a whiff of gee guys sorry for beaming these three clowns in aid of a 6 figure scam into your living room and onto your phones in the first place in any of these stories. man.
nonrandomalpha,"as we head into nfl week 7 here is a quick snapshot of where  core #sportfolio performance stands v. market competitors. 

 dipped after rough 1-4 showing while  climbed the standings off redhot 4-1 week. top 3 public consensus picks in free-fall"
nonrandomalpha,sure however units are then arbitrary have no determinable value and lack any expression of conviction - which is critical to a followers fundamental assessment of a betting recommendation. using  percent  of bankroll packages all of this into a single number.
nonrandomalpha,im not saying the ravens will completely suck but our under 8.5 futures bet priced in that the ravens would beat both the dolphins and cardinals. id say ravens go 3-3 in division and would err on the side of 2-4.
LeeSharpeNFL,"tiebreakers are built in through all the way down through strength of schedule the 6th tiebreaker.

once it gets down to the 7th tiebreaker of ""points scored rank within conference plus points allowed rank within conference"" it just breaks it randomly."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my guess is  it is  harder on london games for west coast teams than east coast teams (but called it out specifically).

you're right on lac it looks the nfl moved that game since i last did a schedule import. thanks."
LeeSharpeNFL,hmm. my instinct was this is good for the 49ers as generally weather is more low scoring and adds variance helping the underdog. but it may be the ravens are just so unique of a team this doesn't apply to them.
whale_capper,every half point has a specific value by far the most value is captured on a -2.5 that moves to -3 and +3.5 that moves to +3... historic results back to ~2003 are worth digging into to fill out the chart
whale_capper,its possible because they can shoot the lights out from time to time... if they are all hitting i dont see tor keeping pace doesnt change my opinion on the series though raps prevail with coaching advantage and mismatches kawhi creates
JoeyKnish22,theres no confidence rating or any of that. once the spreads are up theyre locked (wont change as board changes). so you can bet stale lines/or be contrarian on any moves. we kept it as simple and user friendly as possible.
JoeyKnish22,probably speaks to how bad game management strategy and general philosophy are across football in general. put if you can hire a couple competent coordinators you can basically put a rah rah figurehead as your hc and keep the ship afloat.
JoeyKnish22,i think i need 56.5 to think about placing a rutgers wager if lanigan is still the qb. if the homeless guy with a decent arm who plays catch in the parking lot walks on ill upgrade ru a few points.
JoeyKnish22,like. its one thing to go rogue. and change the play in the huddle or at the line. but to run a different play and try the qb sneak hero dive when the ten other guys think its a power run
JoeyKnish22,they would definitely have to lock in the nbas best record and he needs a strong uptick in his numbers plus some embiid load management or chunk of games missed. but i dont think any of those things are totally unrealistic.
JoeyKnish22,as it turns out. i actually had this backwards. it was  who was bullish on dimes and said over 20. and boston lover uncle k who always believed in the pats d. my bad disregard the poll nothing to see here.
JoeyKnish22,"our subscribers often get better lines than we release cause even with our 100s of pro subs thousands of winning plays and millions of dollars the lines dont move 

well folks sounds like a fucking jamboree of free money im in!"
JoeyKnish22,yup thats the x factor. can a bevell offense be productive/efficient enough in the 2019 nfl for them to have success. especially without an elite/mobile qb like he had in sea. im dubious but think the defense should be vastly improved.
TheKostos,"decalf metcalf caught that pass poured himself a cup of joe (decaf of course) sipped that sumbitch while contemplating the meaning of life took nineteen steps learned how to play piano and them fumbled

TheKostos,never thought i'd see the day where i'd take glee in rooting against my favorite team. but john mara can't lose enough to make me happy. i want this team to be the biggest disaster in the league. ownership deserves it.
TheKostos,not totally upset as a titans bettor because i expected the chiefs to score 30+ no matter the game script. if you bet the titans its because you think they can score enough to keep up. i still think they can.
LockyLockerson,it doesn't necessarily create value it just explains why the market has shifted so much.  sometimes that level of movement proves to be correct and indicative of who the teams are.  just depends on the specific teams involved and the background.
LockyLockerson,"i may bet auburn which is what my #'s say to do but not totally sure yet.  something about nix in that environment (which isn't exactly the same as whatever arlington tx was like) doesn't strike me as ""must bet immediately"""
DannyParkins,jim boylen just cited developing his backups to defend not putting his starters back in the 4th quarter of an nba game as they were blowing the lead. this isnt high school or the d league. that was odd at best.

DannyParkins,we really wont call it a success until we have comcast done. - crane kenney to  on the launch of  i respect that level of honesty. if comcast isnt on board by opening day its going to be a massive story.
DannyParkins,ive found your comments on this very interesting i agree the grandstanding on twitter in the immediate aftermath is just shallow pandering. but you agree colorado should be in his obituary right? and isnt that whats happening now? obituaries and eulogies.
Gingfacekillah,i've read them all. wonderfully helpful. they look at the problems faced in betting critically and logically. they help readers keenly understand how difficult the road ahead is and only by understanding the problem can we proceed to devise possible solutions.
Gingfacekillah,i've been thinking it might be mitigated with an added factor in forecasts that accounts for 3pm standard deviation. if you've got a team that has high variance on 3's then the 2.5 point edge you've forecasted isn't nearly as confident.
Gingfacekillah,well that was much better! managed to set the total down nice and close to the final score the point spread similarly. one game doesn't mean much but this model appears to have tracked the game better than the previous versions.
Gingfacekillah,apparently men and women are exactly the same until that position confers no benefit or imposes costs on women. then all of a sudden common sense biological understandings and reason come back in vogue. have fun untangling that gordian knot feminists.
logan_matthews9,"i remember when spanky trashed actuaries because they were gamblers who couldnt make it. 

yes i guess ill try to solider on with my great relationship with my wife and children clean legal record and healthy lifestyle. thoughts and prayers needed"

adamchernoff,that was a wild number! makes up a bit for the other two losers. you guys should have cut me off when i got rolling with new england haha. hopefully the five teaser legs got a few listeners ahead this week.
adamchernoff,"sam darnold gets a $20m signing bonus and a ton more in endorsements which makes me question his judgement here. with money not a limitation why on earth go to something called ""bounce sporting club"" instead of mcsorley's after a win?"
adamchernoff,from a price and future outlook perspective (two key words being price and future outlook when reading this tweet) the eagles are the best team in the nfc and should be in every bettors account if not already at 16/1  22/1.
adamchernoff,of course it can! plenty of high performing decision makers use meditation to stay focused and balanced. new trend is bbq therapy. after 5 hours sitting outside and putting logs on a fire you come back awfully fresh the next day...
adamchernoff,"in the offseason i keep notes on teams and thoughts on betting for the upcoming year.

 decided the notes were worth publishing. we worked together to put up a last minute nfl 2019 betting preview. i hope this brings you value."
adamchernoff,a white label is likely going to push for a  percent  of handle (speaking from experience using dgs). support staffing and management is more of a headache than anything but another $150k per year. then the float which depends on state.

Ccon8181,lol #bengals ... why waste the effort to play conservative in ot?! use this info going forward if they keep this coach. in his first tear so hell be around for a few but coaches scared. #bengals gonna bungal ... #cinvsmia
Ccon8181,so frustrating backing harden and the #rockets ... looks like harden is on one of his moods. barley making it past half court on offense. not playing any defense in due or die game.. gonna be tough to get the cover
Ccon8181,even with the #nba season over seeing the #nbadraft2018 tonight takes me back to what capped a tough nba postseason. rockets +5.5 missing 27 straight 3pt and blowing 11 point halftime lead to lose by 9. that was a big loss.
ToddFuhrman,"how much can public perception and two games change a number this time of year?

#cfplayoff title game is now lsu -5.5/-6

before the semifinals took place most oddsmakers expected to open a potential lsu vs clemson title game at pk"
ToddFuhrman,i always joke if they told kids in school all those stats and probabilities classes would pay off later in life we'd all have paid closer attention...can see it now 7th grade math teachers handing out parlay cards for educational purposes
ToddFuhrman,"game on!  and myself dug deep into the biggest games of nfl week 1

 atl at minutes (4:47)
 ten at cle (14:02)
 kc at jax (26:07)
 lar at car (36:10)
 pit at ne (44:30)
 gb at chi (53:41)

ToddFuhrman,the polarizing responses to andrew luck's sudden retirement are pretty wild; you see the very emotional fan side angered by the developments while the other side tries to contextualize how difficult this decision must have been for the former #1 pick
ToddFuhrman,"who do we have to call   to make sure we get the brady debut on  this fall?  

we know  was a-list material putting  in his place but  wouldn't grace us with his presence last season so that should probably change too"
ToddFuhrman,"always fun jumping on with you boys and thomas thanks for the kind words.  

now if the jox decides to move the roundtable up again to say 3am pacific we might need a pre-tape or i'll be sending breakfast invoices ha"
TheCousinSal,beyond god awful play-calling by oregon (in that they thought they needed to call a play vs. kneel and then punt with 8 seconds left).  the live odds before the cristobal in-game stroke had to be somewhere in the -1000000000000 range
TheCousinSal,in the past ive run a contest on  where someone would win my house if they completed a perfect ncaa tournament bracket. this year there would be 250k people on the deed as this is what that would loook like. #ripmarchmadness
TheCousinSal,"wow vrabel...
- draw pats offsides
- attempt a field goal
- go for it on 4th and 4

none of those things crossed your mind? just allowing brady a chance to win at home. very fortunate if this works out."
12Xpert,it does but  that is  not the question i'm asking. i want to know if the difference between expected and actual is statistically significant. if it is then this supports  if it isn't we have to carry on believing in clvh.
12Xpert,its really very simple and those looking to overturn that process on the grounds that they dont like it are disingenuous and anti democratic. the arguments they use to defend their position would never have been used for the opposite outcome.
12Xpert,as always time will tell. disaster is relative time dependent and correlates with confirmation bias. the uk joining the eu was a disaster for australia and new zealand initially but arguably it turned out pretty well for them in the end.
12Xpert,if teams were awarded points according to the rateform ratings system methodology then liverpool were champions arsenal get the last champions league place instead of tottenham and brighton were relegated instead of cardiff. huge gap from top 2 to the rest.
12Xpert,i have thought about starting a new service which simply rates tipsters against the closing line. but  is sort of already doing that privately and  it is  still unclear whether closing line value is the fairest way to measure a tipster.
12Xpert,i suppose it does seem quite high but this is what was implied by the amount of odds movement that is typically seen. this was for a 1x2 soccer market. you might get a different figure for 2-way spreads or over/under.
12Xpert,"lessons in data mining: part 2:

mschwimer,i appreciate the kind words. the jambos daily wager picks have been ridiculously good. however you should go to  if you want a more accurate picture of how our model performs.  unfortunately it is much worse than our espn record currently.
mschwimer,the last 2 games of the week were the browns on monday night and the redskins when they got baptized by the giants. lost by a combined 49 points! record now 2-3. not good. hope to turn it around this week!
mschwimer,right. we do. im still not understanding why you dont want others to listen to our debates? shouldnt the people get all the information so they can make a decision themselves? right now they are getting all info from 1 side.
RufusPeabody,because there's no evidence that shows otherwise. very easy to refute me if i'm wrong. have cohnreznick issue a report saying exactly what they did. and actually have it signed by a partner. show the daily emails with the picks.
RufusPeabody,. regarding your claim that 59.36 percent  is fact can you back that up? can you verify that you sent model numbers to  each day from 12/8/2018 to 2/12/2019? the report does not say this. can you please provide evidence.
RufusPeabody,this is a really good overview of the problems with the tout industry and the issues that regulation efforts face. one thing not explored is the legal system. could a tout be held liable (criminal or civil) for false advertising?
RufusPeabody,a well-run monopoly .  that is  a hoot. because margins will be so high the product will not be competitive with offshore local bookies and other states. also look at what's happened in new jersey compared to say rhode island.
RufusPeabody,which active pga tour golfer has the most career pga/wgc top 5 finishes without a win? note that this does *not* include european tour events even ones where the pga tour is listed as a secondary tour for the event.
SportsCheetah,i believe it was the clippers that did this recently in the 4q and forced russ to shoot or make the decisions every trip. and then pat bev did one of the greatest russ impressions this planet has ever seen.
SportsCheetah,rockets-clippers unders about to lose something like a 113 in final 19 minutes of this game. all but 2 of the misses in the last 16 minutes were either fouls resulting in fts for the defense or orebs for points.
SportsCheetah,well the want2win191 guy is mega bitch made and blocked me before talking shit (no really) so if it was him bringing up 31 percent  then offer is on the table for him but i can't see what he tweets.
SportsCheetah,yeah early on they had everybody making one best bet per day no matter what. we can pass now which ive done at times when i dont see anything worth betting. that will help some assuming others do the same.
capjack2000,"i'm hoping we're all concerned over nothing. i'm hoping tn reads all the comments that have been submitted. i'm hoping lawmakers recognize how different states have been successful in their approach. i'm hoping that...

...oh look is that a unicorn!?!"
capjack2000,"who knew ""the granite state"" motto referred to the density of the heads of the regulators in new hampshire?

despite an open rfp process it appears they've decided that nh residents only need two options for sportsbetting:
draftkings and intralot."
capjack2000,how will you access this device remotely? they have a list of all the running processes on the device so  daily fantasy sports  be blatant and use remote software that has ever been made available or sold to the world.
capjack2000,"fun day at #g2e today. met a lot of smart people with great ideas. it was good to see many familiar faces as well. 

i plan to do some live tweeting from the expo hall floor tomorrow throughout the day."
capjack2000,they dont list salary range but im going to guess it doesnt pay enough. nothing against statsbomb but these sportsbetting related companies cant hold the best talent because they cant compete against the sports teams or the big betting syndicates.
capjack2000,correct. i was asked to write an article for them of my choosing. i thought it was a pretty good article. i was paid for my work. ironically the only sportsbooks i mention and speak highly of are pinnacle  cris:
capjack2000,"ah so thats why the market was never as soft as i expected it to be. 

yes i was being sarcastic. i agree with purdum that its not what you bet on but how you bet that dictates problematic behavior."
dinkinc,i think don cherry is a good man with no filter..  not so sure about jimmy the greek. both said stupid things and got fired. they would be much better off if they were president where stupidity is perfectly fine
dinkinc,if only vince had the balls to change the finish while watching the murphy-roman match and put murphy over clean...it would have created an instant star and taught the viewers they cant take the results of a match for granted
robpizzola,i never liked christmas music so decided a few years ago that i was going to force myself to learn a new christmas tune each year in the hope that maybe id come around. this one was fun. #christmas #merrychristmas
RASPicks,in the process of finding a suitable escrow for this i am sure it will turn out to be a waste of time as the chances of you escrowing $1 million on reasonable terms are next to zero.  we'll see.
RASPicks,no our full game stuff was superior to 2nd halves for years.  one of the main reasons we shifted to 2nd halves is because it is has proven to be the easiest for most customers to get release lines consistently.
RASPicks,try  or   bookmaker originates lines in most us markets (everyone else copies) pinnacle offers reduced juice and unlimited rebets.  both have the most accurate lines in the world and in almost all cases neither will kick you out for winning.
VegasRefund,see snacks like goldfish/cheese-its are always at your house which suppresses the urgency to eat them... pistachios are more of a spontaneous snack combined with the light salt and non-filling lightness to them is why they are #1 most addicting.
VegasRefund,who approved fergie to roll with her national anthem? its not like she just went out there and sang it she had to have had at the very least a rehearsal where some non-fergie brass witnessed that train wreck. baffling.
VegasRefund,peterman not to throw an int at +250 is very interesting to me.. weather limiting the amount of attempts (already a run first offense) colts poor secondary and the number is just inflated based on his prior 5 int game.
suuma810,"jj watt - on limited snaps - will very likely go against rookie right tackle cody ford.

he played only eight games but watthas the third-highest pass-rushing grade among qualified edge defenders and ranks 1st in pass-rush productivity.

interesting matchup."
suuma810,"nfl #betting tip 8:

line management is key. example: never bet into -3.5 -110 always sell it to -4 +100.  it is  more profitable long-term. sports betting is math - these are the kind of things that improve your roi."
ClevTA,its probably the best advanced stat metric available to the public. so  it is  a really good indication of how good the teams are currently much better than pure win/loss records bc all of their stats are adjusted for opponents.
ClevTA,that solves it then. remember when colt mccoy led a browns team that destroyed the patriots? how about when the lions beat ne last year? its the nfl anybody can win let alone a team as talented as the browns
CizzlingSports,"always love it when idiot frauds like # worst of all time   cry abt ignoring alleged winning records from past years when: 1) they didn't post the picks publicly and 2) didn't track them personally

CizzlingSports,.(1/x) conservatively assuming -110 odds on every bet (this isn't the case we know) it appears a $300 betting 17-week  subscriber has to date needed a $21177.00 bankroll just to survive the first 20 days of the 119 day package...
CizzlingSports,"1) he thinks not following his stale line contest picks = ""missed out on the money""

2) any money he claims he made nfl wk1-wk17 was in any case wiped out by atrocious playoff picks

CizzlingSports,the fine print requires in-person jams arbitration in md and that the sub front the $1500 filing fee unless the sub immediately opts out of arbitration. mouth-breathing pick buyers always read the fine print. also no prevailing party fees provision.
spanky,in every aspect of gambling  they give you the world if they think they have the edge... onxe they realize that you actually have the edge panic ensues and they either cut you down significantly or give you the boot....
spanky,stop with your bullshit patronizing.   daily fantasy sports  try to hate on me and then congratulate me.  you're an rx/majorwager junkie who's been hating on me since day one.  i've forgotten most of what you would ever learn.  step aside.
spanky,ill take the dog for the limit... these guys are the real deal.  i got a real good feeling about this joint...   and  are the only real bookmakers in new jersey... everyone else should be embarrassed to call themselves bookmakers
spanky,i like your take. question then becomes is winning the .1 unit worth the effort?  i know many pros that dont mind laying heavy juice.  i myself am wired to look to take plus juice or lay small minus juice.
spanky,sure!  find out if you could bring a friend.  this email you received is a perfect example of how out of touch  a british bookmaker is with new jersey citizens.  the town is spelled marlboro not marlborough!  what a joke!

PlusEVAnalytics,"#1 would inject more randomness into the results than is needed to judge the value of the picks by making them order dependent.
#2 would mask any critical errors in your model and has nothing to do with bankroll management."
PlusEVAnalytics,the gas stations dont care. they get a commission on both tix sold and winners redeemed. if you pay for todays tix with yesterdays winners they can double dip. aps are probably keeping half the convenience stores in ontario open.
aluckyaday,"""at the direction of the president the us military has taken decisive defensive action to protect us personnel abroad by killing qasem soleimani."" followed by ""the us embassy in baghdad has urged citizens to depart iraq immediately following the strike"""
aluckyaday,there is not the casino culture in europe especially in the uk working classes. as gambling has been freely available forever with betting shops on every street corner recreational gambling has been on horses and dogs and more recently football.
aluckyaday,i'm guessing you took early prices that beat bfsp? that would confirm what joseph is saying rather than dispute it. winning is pretty much irrelevant it is if you beat the closing line that matters as far as restrictions go
aluckyaday,seriously though facebook have always done this. not just for political ads. they say it is the responsibility of the advertiser to ensure the content is correct/legal. counterfeit goods copyrighted tv untrue political ads.... facebook makes goolge look like saints!
aluckyaday,my guess it has its origins in horse racing where bets were quickly communicated around the course using sign language known as tic tac. each price has a different sign. so the number of different prices had to be limited.
aluckyaday,they have better software. it just manages that risk differently. restricting customers rather than changing prices. whatever they say sharp syndicates are not the kind of business they want. the information they provide can be obtained elsewhere at lower cost.
aluckyaday,so what you are saying is your model has information that is not in the market price but the market price has information that is not included in your models prediction. so combining the 2 gives an even better prediction?
aluckyaday,yep to most people the mechanics of sports betting is about as interesting as calculus. its actually not much to do with sports and players. its all about numbers how to get those numbers and what to do with them.
aluckyaday,new to this machine learning lark. i was wondering if i should just use a random sample but one line of code to split by year swung it. i'm from the bill gates school lazy programmers are the best ones!
aluckyaday,seems like someone trying to boost their ego to me. i thought courtsiders were usually on the payroll of syndicates and are not involved in placing the bets. he probably has no idea where or how the bets are placed!
aluckyaday,i would not expect to be able to detect a simple bias e.g. fav/longshot home/away etc. but they can use player/market models to detect much more complicated biases tailored to the particular market and the type of customers it attracts.
aluckyaday,interesting. astana have quite an advantage in the 4th to 6th riders. no idea how you would come up with a weighting to reflect it or how much of a difference it actually makes though. seems like  thinks it does!

EdMillerPoker,"our philosophy is quality over quantity.

 it is  trivial to churn out a lines and predictions on all sorts of games if you aren't concerned about consistently delivering predictions that are better than what's widely available in the betting markets."
EdMillerPoker,the dude is a favorite to do 9 figures of damage to the industry might make it to 10. he's like the perfect package to blow everyone's shit up. honestly  daily fantasy sports  know why ppl aren't taking this seriously.
EdMillerPoker,"thats an error. sorry about that. our college requires a manual data entry step and someone typed it in backwards.

we are eliminating that step hopefully by next weeks games and then we shouldnt make that kind of error again."
EdMillerPoker,some industry folks also have a sports betting as financial market model. this also is fundamentally flawed. theres no underlying security of value in sports betting like there is that drives every financial market. its a superficial and spurious analogy.
EdMillerPoker,"""con you out of a kidney"" is fucking brutal and ruins this whole silly hypothetical. kidney disease kills lots of people and live donor kidney transplants save lives and one kidney works basically as well as two and consider donating.."
EdMillerPoker,over and over i hear ppl targeting roughly the same customer. and it makes sense because in the gold rush phase that customer will be v profitable. but over the long term that customer will be relatively expensive to acquire.
EdMillerPoker,yes. one thing i've thought about all this from the start is how chaotic it would be and very hard to forecast winners and losers. your thought about the online racing angle was new to me and well worth considering.

nonrandomalpha,om field goal  they're not firing nagy. smdh. you homers think bears are going to the super bowl in week 1 and now in week 11 gotta fire the hc. do you at least recognize the extreme and unwarranted irrationality?
nonrandomalpha,i mean its a cool visual not knocking the effort to put it together but it just doesnt seem very informative if omitting such an important assumption. the output is purely academic as opposed to an attempted reflection of reality.
nonrandomalpha,judging performance by exclusively w-l is also not a fair metric in our opinion. it completely omits and ignores the skill of position sizing. in addition reporting risk in conjunction with perf is equally powerful if not even more so.
nonrandomalpha,"have you listened to our initial thoughts on week 2 spreads?

check out what we said about bucs/panthers...and the rest of this week's coming games

(sneak peek: we thought the line should have been closer to -3 or -3.5)  via"
nonrandomalpha,we're notably bearish on the #ravens in 2019. adding under 8.5 wins to the portfolio. our model expectations suggest 6-7 wins is the sweet spot. an implied spread of 1.5 to 2.5 games v. the market is juicy juicy juicy.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it is  an interesting idea. part of me has wondered if i'm supposed to try publishing stuff in some way as opposed to just being on ?

but also with an unrelated full time job it can be challenging too."
LeeSharpeNFL,i have futures on ne to win the super bowl and no to win the nfccg. i'm not saying they're the favorites (i think ravens are/should be) but i do believe the market is underrating both ne's and no's chances.
LeeSharpeNFL,the chances that you lose this challenge and then cannot challenge something later as a result that has much higher leverage in the game is far too high for this to be a good challenge. terrible decision to challenge that.
LeeSharpeNFL,but  it is  a model right? why can't you just apply the model to every frame/receiver if the qb threw it right then? (well just the frames between the qb receiving the snap and then actually throwing the pass/getting sacked/scrambling/fumbling.)
LeeSharpeNFL,"this season is actually my hell.

the bears are playing badly enough to not do anything but trubisky has shown enough flashes of good play to get another shot.

JoeyKnish22,read this thread from the capt. even if its not your state its important as these laws are used to shape future legislation. some absolutely egregious regulations. which is not shocking coming from the scam artist in deep south politics.
JoeyKnish22,team is back to being pretty healthy i think they can win out. super dangerous if they get in theres nobody in the nfc they cant beat. wild card road pathway is fine not like they have any hfa anyway.
JoeyKnish22,heres where karma comes full circle. this has destroyed msus and dantonios reputation locally. theyre on pace for their worst recruiting class in over a decade and dont have a single top 15 kid signed from the state of michigan.
JoeyKnish22,was gonna tweet something similar last night but didnt wanna go down the rabbit hole. if even 10 percent  of the violent domestic issues that players have had were on tape theyd be exponentially worse than what happened last night.
JoeyKnish22,more reports coming in an insider tells me a man identified as preston johnson who goes by the alias sports cheetah or sports cheater  actually loaned chase young $250 to split this bet with him. shocking development more to come.
JoeyKnish22,in all seriousness. +1000 too rich for a guy thats had so many serious injuries in a row and could easily get a lucrative media deal to work in the studio or booth. his play had really regressed as well.
JoeyKnish22,think hes 5-0 would only need 2 more ws to kill it? and heavy chalk this week. but yeah even if he doesnt play this week gotta be close. so would likely need to be hurt again to fuck it
TheKostos,i have zero issue with mahrez he's been en fuego. i do think this xi implies they'll have a more conservative gameplan at least to start before subs. pep overthinks it in big spots imo. too much of a romantic
TheKostos,like i said last night i would have won either way so i dont care but its not even a question that the chiefs got away with a zillion offensive holding calls during the postseason especially this one on bosa
TheKostos,the nfl hof stopped mattering to me when terrell owens  one of the biggest no-brainer first-ballot selections ever  had to wait until year three because he wasnt nice to the media. couldnt give less of a shit about it now
LockyLockerson,only other price  that is  interesting to me is garrett at about 20/1 a lame duck and although i think they'd wait until after regular season to fire him i really think dallas may be headed for a crap season.

Gingfacekillah,nothing particularly original.  and others have written about it at length. i was curious if there was a way to better estimate true possessions with box score data without necessarily counting possessions play by play. this is a preliminary attempt.
Gingfacekillah,you're going to want to decide on a method to map the yardage stats to your target output (win point differential etc.) you can do that through any number of ways in the book including linear regression and logistic regression.
Gingfacekillah,another possibility for preferring overs is that it indulges fan sentiment. with an over bet you can cheer for scoring events. under bets are effectively cheering for failure/underperformance and this can take some getting used to for the recreational bettor.
Gingfacekillah,"- weighted median based on rmse
- weighted regression based on rmse
- convert each model forecast into log odds and run logistic regression
- moneyline algo using each model as an input (ensemble)

try them out compare the results."
Gingfacekillah,anecdotal but what little time i've spent on tennis leads me to believe the upper tier markets are wickedly efficient. did some work with markov chains that looked promising but the sport is eminently forecastable. for you and the books.
Gingfacekillah,spot on. the only anecdotal thing i would add is that a better method should theoretically shorten longer odds the longer they get to account for the flb. so if a game is 1.06/12.99 the vig shouldnt be split evenly.
Gingfacekillah,what are your current thoughts on whether sports betting can be beaten? your first book seems full of pragmatic optimism while your most recent more sceptical. they're great books just curious as to your current take on the subject matter.
logan_matthews9,very true. the fluidity of the sport makes individual contributions tough to quantify. i think its possible - but you have to scrape a lot of things out and build multiple steps to get the +- contribution of each action
logan_matthews9,please bring me all the people bumping their lamar jackson wont be good takes theyve sat on for 5 months preferably from white guys in tinted sunglasses. bonus points if either middle aged or if they simultaneously compliment ryan tannehill

ToddFuhrman,appreciate the kind words but even our podcast isnt for everyone because it assumes a baseline understanding of the space. either way with more states coming on board i think the way people watch sports is going to change significantly
ToddFuhrman,"we want winners!

ToddFuhrman,in a day and age of sports where we're all about precision and accuracy (var instant replay advanced analytics player tracking etc)  it is  always amazed me that soccer still uses largely arbitrary stoppage time to extend games and halves
ToddFuhrman,ha he made us work but pretty sure he had 5 with about 16 minutes to go in the 2nd half; cbs had him there along with fox while espn and yahoo never gave him credit for the offensive boards
TheCousinSal,so after going for it on 4th and short on the first drive of the game and kicking it onside after the dolphins last score - adam gase settles for a  field goal  down 15 in the 4th.  #clownishcoaching #thursdaynightfootball
12Xpert,what i do think should be legislated for is the instance that bookmakers are clear to customers about what bookmaking model they are operating. and their defence that this would be bad for business is not a sufficiently strong defence.
12Xpert,i would assume so although i dont have sufficient data to test it. ive been collecting their total goals odds this season. will probably need a couple of seasons to reliably analyse it. perhaps others have already done it.  ?
12Xpert,i think this is the same explanation for why the tories are always seen as nasty and labour seen as empathetic (because often the former has felt it had to use austerity to pay for the overspending of the latter).
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  forget however that you prove that you're beating the closing line with skill but that doesn't necessarily imply you'll have expected profit. for that you need to beat the closing line by more than the bookmaker's margin.
12Xpert,i agree no excuse. but does that mean i should judge her by her standards with the sort of language she uses? she had a convent school education. i imagine that can influence a person in all sorts of ways.
12Xpert,of course if your odds are not randomly distributed this might account for why you've had a longer than expected losing run. if you have a lot of long odds grouped together then obviously  that is  going to change things.
12Xpert,but the point of my little thought experiment was that if they only had customers taking best prices they would have to close all accounts and they would have no business hence they would be forced to change their model.
12Xpert,i would expect not. analysed a few recent seasons in my last book and they were negative. the document is really more to show how to develop and test a rating system rather than something that definitely a winning system.
12Xpert,that will depend on numerous factors in particular the liquidity of the match you're betting on and when that liquidity is arriving. if most of it in the last 10 minutes then for sure things could change quite a bit.
12Xpert,are you actually going to bother doing some follow up research investigating the success of this #betregret campaign? for sure i  daily fantasy sports  expect a response to this since public dialogue doesn't seem to be in the job spec.
12Xpert,i have -0.55 percent  from 1319 stakes in 1085 matches. chart is date ordered. given this sample size and the average odds (4.62) this is not a statistically significant difference compared to the overall population of bets from all leagues.
JambosPicks,4. we know  is respected in the industry and never made claims against their service just their questioning of ours. we simply made a bold statement and ras called bs. we said lets bet on it they opted not to.(cont.)
mschwimer,please go on our site and use the units calculator! put in the amount you want to bet per game. if it doesnt make sense for you dont sign up! will be to hard to win and beat the fee
mschwimer,"a fraud doesnt put the money up to back up what they say. 

a fraud is someone who doesnt stand behind the words they say. this is unequivocally what you are. its just the facts. this is not an opinion."
mschwimer,im listening to our subscribers and giving them what they want. which is to know where the best line is available. also using scoring system that makes the most sense and is a big part of us dollars being bet.
mschwimer,just spoke with fanduel sportsbook rep. according to them both bets would still be pending. nothing official. so the over will win and the moneyline will be pending. they did say this is determined on a book by book basis.
mschwimer,for all  subscribers. we posted a line for the vermont game at +10.5 from draftkings. we have since found a bug in don best and draftkings so we revised the line to +9. it is still a play on vermont.
RufusPeabody,on the eve of the first # college football playoff rankings heres the  now-cast. note that this isnt what we *think* the committee should do. this is the output of a model we built to predict the committee rankings.
RufusPeabody,you'd have to ask him. i remember in 2008 he had binders full of player ratings (he could tell me about the third-string left tackle at new mexico state).  daily fantasy sports  know what his process is now. (cc
RufusPeabody,check roulette. very different. you gamble on the sum of the digits of the bottom line of the check. everyone takes numbers 0-9. for example $129.18 would be 21 so whoever had the 1 would pay the whole bill.
RufusPeabody,getting the best of the number is a huge component to being a successful bettor. but if a tout is selling picks they can't assume that a customer have every freaking book available. sop is the consensus market number.
RufusPeabody,wasnt sure i was allowed to tweet about it but . was an honor spending time with some really freaking smart gamblers. learned a lot about a lot of things and unfortunately really let down the liberals in  (sorry)
capjack2000,"honestly i  daily fantasy sports  know how procedures like these could be allowed to reach live wagering. these aren't uncharted waters. 

if they are failing to understand basic gaming tax law what else is being done incorrectly in oregon?"
capjack2000,"maybe yahoo can help americanize the betmgm (gvc) product. although the fact that they announced this at 1am et shows they are already thinking european. 

when i have time ill enumerate how confusing betmgm is to a us bettor."
capjack2000,ah i see. yes they could. what we've seen so far in nj is they  daily fantasy sports  like going to the dge to explain these sort of mistakes and they often let the bets stand as customer goodwill.
capjack2000,"that is  a popular gag gift. i'm sure any of these bookmakers will tell you that they get complaints from people in december who want to bet on a team already eliminated from contention. 

""makes a great stocking stuffer!"""
capjack2000,"i hope you're right krack but we all know which way mgm has been trending lately - especially with sports betting. looks like a nice space but if the management has a ""european accent"" the result will be predictable."
capjack2000,we may have our first pa book unilaterally cancelling a made wager. this guy bet sea -122 to win last night's game  they are refusing to cash it saying it is a bad line. the line closed sea -120.
capjack2000,i want to know more about this case. it took 5 years to resolve? how was he doing this and how was he detected? i suspect these are answers that ill never get but would be fascinating to know.
capjack2000,something with true market odds of +150 wouldn't need to be priced at +200 to make sharps swarm. point being if you are looking to balance out your liability sharp money can be easily projected and will assist you.
dinkinc,racing is not coming back......  ever....... no one gives it a chance as the industry just tries to suck out the remaining  customers as quickly as possible instead of trying to present a winnable program to draw new players
dinkinc,if you click on the goalies in the ottawa game you will notice that nilsson has a 29.3 goals against average... it might be just against the red wings but in some ways don best is a bad joke
dinkinc,do you really think the state racing boards will go quietly ?? i really think this game is doomed... if any state gets this on a ballot the results would be the same as they were for the greyhounds
dinkinc,i use speed figures not available to the public.  i also do not spend enough time with horse handicapping to reach a point where i feel i can teach.  there are so many elements to become a winning player
dinkinc,one of the nicest people i know with a side of prankster in her   has a pretty important ufc fight on saturday....  i would like all my friends to send her a funny gif or some words of encouragement
robpizzola,one screen call all game. no rb in the backfield to help block in passing situations. tight ends not chipping the edge rushers. yeah the offensive line stinks so you do things to mitigate it as much as possible.
robpizzola,pjanic *could* be world class but he will never be world class playing as a holding midfielder. he needs to be further up the pitch. emre can could probably fill that holding midfielder spot if sarri didn't hate him.
robpizzola,"""the brpd says they  daily fantasy sports  believe collins was connected with her death in any way -- and say he's no longer a focus of the investigation.""

typical patriots fan trying to spin the truth once again smh"
robpizzola,"the average person does not quite realize how much variance there is in a hockey playoff series.

suuma810,you could boost their run efficiency with some more run-friendly situational play-calls by avoiding more of those negative expected value runs e.g. running on 2nd  10 or into stacked boxes. but the offensive line is still a big problem.
suuma810,now i have officially seen it all. #giants down by 11 ball at the atl1 47 seconds and no timeouts left. pat shurmur calls back-to-back (!) qb sneaks with eli manning for no gain which eats 37 seconds. speechless.
suuma810,based on their pass efficiency the #bills are expected to score 8.3 offensive ppg this season but they actually scored 12.1 ppg. their defensive turnovers were key for good field position on their scoring drives e.g. against the #vikings.
ClevTA,matt rhule should be the top candidate for most any nfl job including the browns. resurrected two different programs including one almost impossible situation at baylor. but doesnt have the clout of some others who demand all the power
ClevTA,um what does a rookie hc trend on  thursday night football  have to do with how good or bad the browns are? the browns could be undefeated and  it is  still a trend that applies. i'll sit and wait
ClevTA,i totally agree. maybe u just shouldve worded your intital tweet to include this was a preseason quote from a vegas source is all. otherwise ppl think this is your calculation or current estimate based purely on market reaction
CizzlingSports,(2/x)the report and assertions are both dated 2/19/19. its not clear thus whether the auditor merely rubber-stamped the assertions or actually audited 935 individual plays for availability and performance which seems like it would take more than a day.

spanky,"its a myth that pro bettors bet 100 games a year. 

to realize your edge and bring the luck factor (variance) close to 0 you need many many pieces. i myself place tens of thousands of bets a year."
spanky,"resorts is the big secret in the nj bookmaking landscape. when anyone thinks of resorts they immediately think   

no! they are two different companies! 

 is a walk up dressmaker that booted me

 is an online bookmaker that welcomes me"
spanky,"thanks to     all for thinking i was interesting enough to spend time with me.  i tricked you all 

thanks to my partner  whose idea it was to start this whole social media thing and tape us getting kicked out."
spanky,the thing that impressed me the most with  is their distribution of a printed house limit sheet.  clear limits per sport for side/tot/ml. this may seem like a no-brainer but no regulated sportsbook in the united states has this.
spanky,the best businesses recognize talent and channel it in a positive way. some of the best casino surveillance guys are former cheats and swindlers. i hope one day his talent is used to benefit rather than hurt the community.
spanky,to all new sportsbooks out there: your attempt to disguise your lackluster everyday operations with these promotions are transparent to the educated bettor.  please prioritize implementing fair limits better software and acceptance of all customers before offering this crap!
spanky,my compliments have nothing to do with getting higher limits.  i live in nj!  fyi they gave me a dime on hoop totals when i was there last month.  but i gave them several big nfl plays to reciprocate.
PlusEVAnalytics,with this much data from so many episodes youd think it could be reverse engineered but i havent heard of anyone whos been able to do it. makes me think theres a random component and/or a judgmentally selected component.
aluckyaday,that is pretty much what casual horse racing punters do. they make random bets at best prices on oddschecker with bog. that is a +ev strategy hence why if it is only what you do you will be restricted.
aluckyaday,the problem i have with recreational sharps calling for restrictions to be banned means books will become much sharper pinnacle/cris clones but with more vig. they won't be able to beat them so they will be no better off!
aluckyaday,i guess the biggest issue with beginners blindly using moneyline to predict sports outcomes is overfitting. if when learning your model is predicting  60 percent  of points spread markets correctly its likely the model will be useless going forward!
aluckyaday,could this not just be a function of the maths and rounding errors? anything over 2.0 now seems to be quoted to 2 decimal places whilst anything below it is quoted to 3. has it always been that way?
theFirmAISports,i scraped it from . it looks like theres a paywall to get past years data. but each week i run my code to grab the data. unfortunately i only have 2018 tho. ill be collecting this years too

EdMillerPoker,obv i pretty strongly agree with dustin here. real in-play is coming. exactly how it finds its way into the industry is tbd but once it has a foothold i feel like it will become standard offering v quickly.
EdMillerPoker,not that you asked lol but i agree with you in short-medium term but disagree long term as this rule forces the industry to find a more customer-friendly equilibrium. but theres a good bit of suck during the transition.
EdMillerPoker,it may be necessary for me to invoice you the difference between the initial amount ($300) and any increase in market value up to 100 percent  of the initial amount at a frequency not to exceed every six months.
EdMillerPoker,"still the ftc said the offer of free credit monitoring is a good deal. ""the free credit monitoring is worth a lot more than the cash reimbursement alternative. the market value would be hundreds of dollars a year""

EdMillerPoker,meh. seems obv to me the gripe isnt really about admissions standards its about the role elite universities play in curating our national power structures and the kid who many have identified as a formidable opponent just got fast-tracked.
nonrandomalpha,my virtues are substantive as opposed to the cheap political pandering orientation which you ostensibly hold dear and attempt to express as lazy generic provocations. we get it youre politically correct. twitter probably isnt your best safe space steve.

nonrandomalpha,great breakdown; for similar reasons the late 90s/early 00s #broncos could slide in any random rb and make them look like a stud (olandis gary anyone?). it was the robust supporting cast that made the individual rb look dominant.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the betting markets have no with 32 percent  to win the nfccg and gb at 20 percent  (post-vig numbers).

LeeSharpeNFL,i didn't know he'd be like that but people know how to play him now. fuller always plays off. if the qb has watched film and knows right where to place the ball.... not hard to get to him.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""once you adjust for the distance between the target and the line of scrimmage trubisky has completed 7.7 percent  less passes than league averages at that distance from 2016-2018 data where the target was beyond the first down marker."""

Gingfacekillah,perfect. that gives me somewhere to start anyways. if i begin with the idea that its basically random but correlated to substitutions delays and hfa i might be able to find a way to make an added time forecast.
Gingfacekillah,i have yes. one thought is that around this time of year books have enough data on teams and on bettors team tendencies to get very tight lines and shade the overs knowing most bettors will favour them regardless.
Gingfacekillah,in the grand scheme of things one game doesnt mean much. nice to have a game flow that looks like my models forecast once in a blue moon  its good to be able to bounce ideas off each other!
Gingfacekillah,sure! there are different ways to remove the vig from book prices to get the implied true probabilities. some are better than others. for 2-outcome events id recommend the logarithmic method. for 3-way bets id recommend the shin method.

adamchernoff,tough job for anyone. it will depend on how quickly he has the nerve to take a stand against the fans. falcao is not getting them into 2022 by himself. his success as manager will come down to timing.
adamchernoff,another big day of college hoops for members of the simple handicap slack channel with winners on purdue -12 (won by 35) and ucf +7.5 (win outright by 5). another example of what gets posted in the channel below.
adamchernoff,my cable contract is coming to end this month and i am debating getting into using a vpn for youtube tv and fubotv through and appletv. any other paid subscriptions from the us for sports worth a look at?

ToddFuhrman,"there's a major difference between knowing/following sports and being a successful sports bettor.

the earlier new bettors recognize this fact the faster they can evolve in the space by learning the math and market analysis it takes to succeed."
ToddFuhrman,people are slow to understand that...they see a longshot and assume value even if there's no chance a ticket cashes.  it continues to boggle my mind but everyone wants to to be holding that sports lottery ticket these days
ToddFuhrman,we have no idea what the landscape of the sport will be and if we're talking about 5-7 programs who cares...no need to schedule 10+ years in advance;  daily fantasy sports  buy this logistics nonsense. just one man's opinion
ToddFuhrman,lucky enough to surround myself with sharp people that have various specialties.  strength of position always varies by sport and when it comes to soccer i honestly shouldn't be investing just watching as a fan with the occasional angle
TheCousinSal,that is  as weak a penalty as you'll see. but  that is  what spain gets for screwing us with tariffs all of these years. actually not sure what i'm talking about here - but we'll take it nonetheless. #uswnt

12Xpert,"(1/2) obviously not the latter method. for example suppose both figures were 5/10 (0.5). multiplying gives you 25 percent  which intuitively would not feel correct.
the first method is better but there is a wider issue in following this."
12Xpert,"not wishing to detract from the sublime artistry of salahs goal but i suspect given the curl less than one degree difference in trajectory would have meant either hitting the near post or missing far one. totally obscene 
#rbsliv"
12Xpert,probably because theyre looking to attract new customers with these silly bets. to my knowledge there is no sharp efficient bookmaker offering such markets so its impossible to have a reliable measure of true odds and hence offer woc.
12Xpert,his 8th and 9th tweets are more most interesting and certainly warrant testing. in my view the only way you can force companies to not pass on tax increases to consumers and workers is to either legislate or nationalise.
12Xpert,for an environmentalist i feel that one way to increase the likelihood of bringing people with their arguments is to refrain from using emotive (and intentionally critical and insulting) language like the word 'denier'. it weaponises and polarises debate.
12Xpert,maybe at the same time we end up with fewer gambling addicts. gambling is a natural part of life like eating and drinking. all of those things taken to excess in one way or another aren't good for us.
12Xpert,in april the forecasts were for germany to manage it sometime within 2019. if germany's economy contracts july to september then  it is  in one. specific enough for you or should i just be a wanker and block you?
12Xpert,i actually agree with you about the eu parliament.  it is  elected to make decisions on our behalf in the same way that we elect a uk parliament. indirect democracy is clearly more practical than holding referendums on everything.
12Xpert,not sure what the argument was here but i think  it is  still important to highly the cul-de-sacs that data mining can take you down if you're careful how you use it. these two quotes should do the job.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  profess to be a smart arse so yes this is the best system i know. if i was a smart arse i wouldn't be wasting my time on twitter. what's the best system you know?
12Xpert,"cambridge dictionary define ""savvy"" as ""practical knowledge and ability."" i'm guessing that this is different to guesswork chance luck and randomness. if you show anything other than the latter you will get restricted. hence how are these adverts acceptable?"
12Xpert,"on 9th january you wrote this piece about  affiliate relaunching with

mschwimer,"their is ceainty!!!!

look up what it means to file a reg d with the sec. if we dont pay then me marvin bush david ganek steve duncker and several others are breaching the contract and breaking the law!!!!"
mschwimer,i never said any of that!  rufus is a subscriber.  all of our picks were free to everyone that subscribed!  i have no idea if he is playing our picks or not.  you will have to ask him that.
mschwimer,i have not heard a single reason from you  why do you need to trust us if we put the money in an escrow account on your terms?  again have not heard one single reason from you. still waiting...
mschwimer,i wish i could take big action on even money that tua wont be the number 1 pick. hate how you cant play the other side. even if juice is outrageous still should be able play bet both sides.
RufusPeabody,haven't been running it as regularly. plus the question of integrating player model into it (which i  daily fantasy sports  want to make public). but in general we've been dialing back the public stuff a bit this year.
RufusPeabody,im not going to waste my time boosting the profile of a fraud tout. we dont have mutual friends. and betting 100k with an internet stranger who you know to be a con artist would be incredibly dumb.
RufusPeabody,yeah you dont have standings but you experience whether you drafted a good team every single day. when you have to order a turkey blt hold the turkey bread and lettuce youre gonna be cursing your draft strategy.
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  think they ran it by hard rock and i  daily fantasy sports  *think* hard rock would have any issue with it (based on the people i know there) but i can't say for certain.
SportsCheetah,thats the worst thing ive ever seen just waive the flag when you know you got it wrong. 3rd down is never run there. then doubling-down with roughing after not calling the one on mitchell is next-level too.
SportsCheetah,i had  look this one up: wisconsin would be the 3rd big ten team in the ap poll era (since 1936) to record 3 straight shutouts to start the season joining northwestern in 1938 and wisconsin in 1937.
capjack2000,"ti and cc are owned by phil ruffin who also owns casino miami. 

as for what ruffin will do with cc that remains to be seen. however  daily fantasy sports  expect that mlb stadium rumor to hold water."
capjack2000,i'll be the first to admit how shocked i was that indiana got it done in record time...but illinois approving licenses developing regulations training staff testing controls and building out sportsbooks all in less than 3 months?...in illinois?!?
capjack2000,"that is  a big unknown. however we also have betstars and resortscasino muddled in with the dk numbers...so we'll call it a wash at this point.

 that is  still my #1 complaint about nj reporting. lack of transparency."
capjack2000,peta also had a pythagorean theorem for nfl that he was working on a couple years ago. i ran some tests on it and it was decent. i think he abandoned it for pga. ugh those golf bettors.
capjack2000,comparing sports betting to the lottery seems like a more illogical leap imo. better comparison would be retail investing. these cle bettors at dk are like those that rushed into bitcoin in january 2018...but they cant cash out.
capjack2000,"this from the only sport that already puts all their data on the web in real-time in xml format for everyone...oh and also takes healthy breaks between each action in the game. 

hope sportradar didnt pay too much."
dinkinc,"when i went on  i said this about ticket construction... "" think about what most tvg pick 4's look like and  daily fantasy sports  do that ""  my friend  says it best ""leave yourself some hurdles ""  ..."
robpizzola,i was downtown in different spots all day. the police did a great job. they were literally everywhere but didnt interfere in the celebration. two dummies decide to pull out guns and they were taken down almost immediately.

suuma810,"not a  college football  guy but:

ClevTA,ok guys i know its not likely. just saying baylor wins close and has potential for backup qb playing in the playoff georgia loses on a last second  field goal . just saying like a 15 percent  probability
ClevTA,i dont understand this tweet at all. i was disagreeing with lima saying going for it was unorthodox. i was saying bc of the wind that kicking wasnt even an option. going for it was the only choice
ClevTA,for the first time in a long time i didnt take any heisman sleepers this year.  but if u forced me to pick one out of the blue guy i think i would have gone with tommy stevens

spanky,"some advice to risk management companies and/or software providers.  

allow bookmakers to be bookmakers and deal according to their chart.  

using a market consensus line or simply copying pinny or cris is not a viable long term strategy."
spanky,there is 100 percent  a delay. wait till you look at 1st half moneylines and 3rd quarter moneylines.  its incredible how all the current sportsbook software out there doesn't allow a piggy back off of the point spread.
spanky,to be young drunk and skinny again with no kids.  having all the time in the world to dream up crazy shit.  seems like a lifetime ago.. enjoy it pal.  my fat ass will continue to eat sub-optimally.
spanky,had a couple of winners at  so i figured id tap the account out quickly this morning... the delay is out of control!! almost 3 minutes from bet submission to reduced bet approval!!!  this practice is frankly unacceptable...
spanky,im guessing you are talking about us sports....the greek sportsbook hasnt accepted us players in years. anyone there playing us sports is probably sharp and they probably dont have the business on us sports to garner 2-way action
spanky,i  daily fantasy sports  care what the total is -3-110 would be better than -2.5-145.  that being said you bring up a valid point that a spread half point decreases in value the higher the game total is
DocBettor,for the record i wanted to put more on chiefs -110 live but my available balance was already 0 from the earlier plays. it was nice not needing to sweat the back door. congrats to all #chiefskingdom backers!
PlusEVAnalytics,"another  one from my  friend.

an important implication - the frequency of losing runs is driven more by variance than by ev. so all else equal good bettors will have them nearly as often as bad bettors will."
PlusEVAnalytics,averages make peoples brains hurt. instead just subtract the cancelled games totals from the salami. so if the salami is 140 and cancelled games have totals 10 and 8.5 salami gets graded vs a revised total of 121.5.
PlusEVAnalytics,jesus ok let me spell it out for you. your pre-pick selling + units resulted more from the same line shopping that any idiot with a donbest screen can do not from any proprietary jambos data or models.
aluckyaday,i've always found the us leagues opposition to sports betting for integrity reasons strange. its like they did not realise that people can bet on their leagues in other countries. talk about having their head in the sand!
aluckyaday,yep. but that is what recreational players want. that and dopamine . a bigger issue the us will have to face and i have not heard it mention much in us commentary is that dopamine is very addictive.
aluckyaday,bookmakers  daily fantasy sports  exist any more. 1) soft books are marketing companies not interested in taking a bet. 2) sharp books are betting syndicates having to operate  their own book to generate liquidity because of point 1.
aluckyaday,i think it could make sense. shifting the margin is one way to manage the  trading risk. the big missing piece from the jigsaw is the volumes. without that we are just guessing as to why prices move.
aluckyaday,"i've come to the conclusion that any mp speaking in a kind of #brexit debate using an argument similar to ""the british people do/ daily fantasy sports  want that"" should be totally ignored and have their vote cancelled."

EdMillerPoker,"i've noticed a few hype-first launches of companies promising market-dominating predictions at massive scale.

EdMillerPoker,since my followers either are bots or own crypto this is my periodic reminder that usg will ban conversion to usd the moment it suits them and previous precedent for this action is everything usg has ever done

nonrandomalpha,yes exactly lol. and in conjunction with that actively supporting the self-imposed dismantling of a team for an entire season as if that approach wont have unintended and possibly permanent consequences on the culture franchise and fan base.
nonrandomalpha,"teams coming off dominating the dolphins....0-3 against the spread season-to-date 

ravens fail to cover -13 v cards

chargers -6.5 v broncos in wk 5"
nonrandomalpha,"agree same with rodgers even. he looked very very rusty and inaccurate for most of the game.

however i thought during the preseason you were mocking those that were criticizing nagy for not playing any starters in preseason"
nonrandomalpha,this is some great work - interesting results. finding common narratives that are actually statistically insignificant can be powerful tools to better isolating the broader signal through the noise. looking forward to seeing some of your future work.
LeeSharpeNFL,"note that by just running my code manually you won't get the ""note"" and special stuff applied retroactively only for future games. to apply those fixes retroactively run the plays-functions.r file then the code in the following tweet:"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i would count as passing but  that is  based on the goal of trying to evaluate playcall/coaching decision making.

if your goal is something else (say calculating a qb's fantasy value) a different classification may make more sense."
LeeSharpeNFL,the problem with time of possession is it correlates with how much you run which in turn correlates with game script so  it is  a biased data set when trying to use it as a predictor for winning.
LeeSharpeNFL,during cowboys games dak's agent should just sit in the luxury box next to jerry jones and keep holding up signs after every good dak play to let jerry know how much the asking price has gone up.
whale_capper,i definitely look at this as a starting point for a handicap... a lot of these are accounted for (potentially over-accounted for) by the linesmakers/market as such you won't see big against the spread advantages against closing numbers
AndyMSFW,my numbers are at a slight disagreement with it too but i just can't figure out a way that philly's coverage unit doesn't give up a trillion yards to tony pollard screens alone. not to mention his backup.
JoeyKnish22,example: like if a follower comments i had the under (and it lost) they qt and say maybe because youre a fucking idiot. that type of shit. the market is wide open and ppl would eat it up.
JoeyKnish22,it is incredible the league has overturned like 2 pi calls all year when dozens of obvious ones didnt get overturned and they decide to overturn that one on the browns and gift the cards a  touchdown .
JoeyKnish22,"gonna bet some jets at 17. 

this wouldnt bother me as much if i hadnt bet some jets at 15. 

gonna sprint to live betting if the jets lead at any point so i can have less jets."
JoeyKnish22,buy in is $100. after first game we wil put a payout breakdown based on the entries and percentages on the message board. the site takes a 1 percent  rake so that will be obviously be factored in.
JoeyKnish22,yeah. with seattle winning it makes the bet much more hedgeable if you got 25/1 or bettor. but im only invested for low risk ($200) so just gonna let ride. will hedge some if they make the final
JoeyKnish22,im in a major sports city so maybe theres just too much redundancy for me. one guy mentioned mls which is fair but outside of that just wasnt enough for me to justify. i never found myself there.
JoeyKnish22,no koulibaly is a massive blow but still dont believe algeria should be slight chalk here in the afcon final. regardless of group result senegal is the best team in the tournament. sprinkled senegal moneyline for afternoon action.
TheKostos,howd it work out when they fired coughlin and kept reese? this team is so stupid its mind numbing. prepare yourselves for more losing giants fans because its coming. winter is here and summer is many years off
TheKostos,"my girl just now ""maybe your fantasy players  daily fantasy sports  like it that you scream mean things at them"" lmao she may have just cracked the code

""please alvin please try your best to score a touchdown"""
TheKostos,michigan coming off a terrible loss suspended simpson season on the brink and they opened -3 and now out to -4.5 at a nebraska team that almost won at rutgers over the weekend. yeah  that is  a bet.
LockyLockerson,one of the best things about the nba market model is that because  it is  just assuming the market is completely correct it downgraded the warriors real quick.  ton of people on them today ton of unhappy folks.
LockyLockerson,we will be playing things at the extremes since those are the most wrong.  you dont have to bet any of this you can just follow along as we do it the entire postseason.  it should be fun.

Gingfacekillah,the point that is meant is found in the sentence preceding that one. rmse can be sensitive to outliers in your game observations. i can see the confusion though. ill look to correct that. thanks for the feedback!
Gingfacekillah,no sweating the a's today. over 8.5 cashes already for a breezy ride to the end of the game and barring divine intervention oak should take this one no problem up 9 at the top of the 7th.
Gingfacekillah,i cant help but wonder if theres some locker room cohesion issues. westbrook screams obscenities at that fan gets suspended a game and theyve been on a downhill trajectory ever since. grossly underperforming their mean expectation. quite odd.
Gingfacekillah,even the worst teams break ~20 wins. i'd expect chi cle nyk and pho to have some upset wins down the stretch particularly at home to even out the standings. whether that is forecastable is a different question.
Gingfacekillah,the models in the book dont do great against major markets. however had some success with smaller markets. understanding the models and how they work was a really good base for coming up with your own ideas. recommended.
Gingfacekillah,i was particularly interested in reading more about your application of the t test for performance analysis. our discussion of t-test vs z scores made me realize there was a serious gap in my knowledge that needs rectifying.

2h output a duplicate of of the 1h output. game falls 1 point below expectation. market was playing up around ~60 with the 2h price. in play perception for nfl markets is wild..."
adamchernoff,caveat to this would be carolina and chicago which closed very near to where they opened. so 1-9 if you toss those out. but another week of moves getting smoked. four moves of 3.5 or more each lost.

ToddFuhrman,my man! send a pic if you still have it that was no small feat winning that contest back in the day my friend now you need a  football free roll to fill out the trophy case next
ToddFuhrman,"so my biggest question in seeding the field...

michigan st wins the conference beats michigan 3x and ends up with a lower seed in the same bracket as the #1 overall in duke?

committee clearly doing their homework"
TheCousinSal,an all new against all odds podcast previewing super bowl bets with the degenerate trifecta + the lovely and terrifying  and i discuss how we're going to collect $16 million on her royal rumble victory this sunday. #wwe
12Xpert,and it allows them to offer far more markets than an exchange or market-making bookmaker again an advertising plus point. but this also necessitate the banning of those clever enough to know how to find the loss-leading value.
12Xpert,"easy because the recreational bookmakers know that few understand the difference only those who cry ""you ban winners."" those who understand know  it is  a bullshit defence of theirs but  it is  easy for them to deflect it."
12Xpert,"the theory is that closing price is the closest to the 'true' price for all pre-match prices because it contains the most info.

 does a much better job of explaining it than i can. 

obviously unavailable for in-play."
12Xpert,1.0107 will almost certainly not happen by chance (see ) so clearly you're bringing information to the market but  it is  not enough to overcome the margin. of course clvh could all be wrong.  that is  another story.
12Xpert,"because she's a person like me and you. that is the point. read the piece again. ""i hate that people are judged on who they are.""

you  daily fantasy sports  have to like what she says respect that."
12Xpert,i think the best thing that ever happened to me was my first attempt at implementing a system with real money started with 8/10 losses. i got cold feat and abandoned it. i've been a sceptic ever since.
12Xpert,i'd recommend reading the success equation: untangling skill and luck in business sports and investing by michael mauboussin. if you google his name with luck and skill you will find some useful summaries of his thinking on this.
12Xpert,it is  already been explained by me and others. they are the most popular global soft book and 99 percent  of punters need soft books to have a chance of finding +ev. most of those won't get restricted.
12Xpert,i disagree. i would say anything systematic will be withing the bounds of their margin. anything outside it will be their errors or one-off decisions. things that are systematic are much easier to spot meaning they should disappear.
12Xpert,no the point about things regressing to the mean is that it happens because there is nothing causal only luck. however i have written about a possible way to may be exploit others who are fooled by this.
mschwimer,we out of sample back test thousands of games. i am extremely confident we will be positive units (beating the market) at the end of the year. good sample for plays that you see is probably around 1000.
mschwimer,i just looked at all our picks and couldnt find a single example of us using a solo wynn line. can you provide evidence? thats why all our plays are available to the public so everyone can check.
RufusPeabody,"# college football playoff probabilities (via  conditional on winning this weekend:
ohio state/clemson/lsu 100 percent 
georgia 95 percent 
oklahoma 54 percent 
baylor 40 percent 
utah 31 percent 
wisconsin 14 percent 
oregon 0.3 percent 
virginia 0 percent  (sorry)"
RufusPeabody,lets be clear  everyone is limited to some extent. if youre betting your opinion even if youre sharp youll get posted limits at  . at least thats my experience and understanding knowing the guys who run it.
RufusPeabody,i was skeptical of rob at first too. the whole prediction machine predictatitilator thing. but when he told me it was crap that was a big step for us. not a hotel room step but big nonetheless
SportsCheetah,i was just saying its dependent on who is all out for philly too. if theyre a go then i make the eagles a small favorite. a lot of question marks though i havent touched the game.
SportsCheetah,haha i tried to warn her on buffalo but being from cleveland not surprising those stood out. but yeah i was just saying for sure would bet on more faves than dogs from her on the show.
capjack2000,"this is a pretty big deal. 

it represents lobbying dollars for the vastly underfunded racino industry in fl as they fight a slanted playing field vs. the seminoles. 

odds of legal sportsbetting in fl just got better."
capjack2000,"first  it is  the same three guys as last time. one nbcsn host a betting expert (the guy with the hand motion) and then a sports talk radio host from philly. 

demographic of overweight sloppy white guys?"
capjack2000,"just saw that espn is debuting a history of gambling in mlb this january. as i watched the trailer i thought ""this is going to be good..."" 

until i got to the 43 second mark.   ""...nope. pass."""
capjack2000,"this goes beyond which providers are bookmakers v. dressmakers. this is njdge actionable. 

if they can't afford to book an extremely efficient market fairly they shouldn't be permitted to book. it at least deserves censure from njdge."
capjack2000,"here's an odd request:
if you were one of the guys that reached out to me about getting limited after betting on nyy ahead of their first game of the year. can you shoot me a dm?"
capjack2000,"i think we'll see more of it. nba wanted 1 percent  of handle. ""official data"" is going to want  percent  of handle to appear unbiased. any federal framework to enable interstate betting will want  percent  of handle."
capjack2000,"vig-free pricing for gsw:
game 5 : +100 pk (50 percent )
game 6 : -250 -6.5 (71.4 percent )
game 7 : -110 -1.5 (52.5 percent )
fair gsw odds imo = 18.74 percent  = +434"
capjack2000,absolutely nothing. legal sports betting is an ecology that should be allowed to grow at an organic pace due to public interest. outside influences in the form of excessive taxes or excessive regulation inhibit the growth rate.
capjack2000,"both draftkings and fanduel started out in nj with a huge book of customers. 
both had similar pricing. similar offerings. similar promos.

fanduel is now crushing draftkings in revenue. 

i wonder what one thing they do differently?"
capjack2000,"this is similar to the betting public being on a 15 minute delay on in-game betting with the books having the live data. 

asymmetric information is not how any market should be allowed to operate. its unconscionable."
dinkinc,1-0 tonight with the horror of getting rained out of an under with a 2-0 score in the bottom of the ninth... august has not been kind to me or the  horses.... as far as gambling goes
dinkinc,i tend not to be a mark madden fan but he is 100  percent  right here... the world has gone crazy trying to make things right that have nothing to do with making anything right at all
dinkinc,they are trying to lure in slot players while offering nine betting opportunities in 4 1/2 hours.... another great idea.....also   for those who can't decide if they should take up pole vaulting today or go to belmont
robpizzola,i understand that we  daily fantasy sports  want to slow the game down any more than it is right now but when something is that fucking obvious it needs to be called back by any means necessary.
ProfessorShine,you dont think this creates a conflict of interest ms welman?  almost like when as an employee for pregame you ignored all issues they had regarding their sales picks  affiliate deals.  until of course  exposed them later.
suuma810,"during the first half the chargers called six early-down runs outside the goal line for melvin gordon which turned into -3 actual yards.

they punted four times after a series that started with a first down run."
suuma810,three seasons in a row the #titans have won 9 games. on paper they are a better squad than last year  arthur smith will likely show better situational play-calling. no andrew luck. but nobody cares about them
suuma810,youll find all the weekly write-ups in the members area on the website. there are some members who dont even bet all my picks they just come for the information to use it for their own process.
suuma810,the vikes have the worst run offense in the league. running the ball even more like on early downs wont help them but hurt their overall efficiency. flippo probably knows that but thats not what zim wants.
suuma810,started watching the atl/no game. your season is on the line your opponent has an elite run defense and can score on every drive. when you run it on 2nd  10 you deserve to get blown out.
suuma810,"i wouldn't really argue against brees being the front-runner for the mvp at this point i think  that is  fair.

but i  daily fantasy sports  get how gurley could possibly be more indispensable than goff at all."
suuma810,they werent basically stopped the hawks relied on lucky bounces they didnt have any control on. or do you think a tipped interception that bounces into the hands of the seahawks should be described at stopping someone?
suuma810,and their best wr admitted he won't be 100 percent  this year. seeing them as a 6-10/7-9 team right now. if you take away russell wilson i  daily fantasy sports  think they win 4 games. do you?
ClevTA,its amazing. hes good with film breakdowns etc but hell say something like this or that zeke is more valuable than dak or that teams need to run the  45 times to win a game. its nuts
ClevTA,but hes not the first person to touch it. thats what ive always been taught that its ok to go out of bounds as long as u arent first touch and u re establish yourself in bounds

CizzlingSports,"they claimed they had 581 plays in wks 1-7 (8/27 - 10/14).

i have 581 without what appears to be the missing push so jambos prob just reported the total plays number wrong on 10/15 (see below)"

spanky,"i just retweeted the interaction between myself and  of  at last years #bosamerica  ...

to all future panelists in 2020 if you practice the same policy prepare for me to ask you the same exact question. 

#beabookmakernotadressmaker"
spanky,"as a bookmaker i never had the attitude of treating wiseguys like the enemy.  

so many amateur and wanna-be bookmakers treat sharps like enemies.  if they would only get educated from chris who has 40+ years experience."
spanky,the people you lease your software from are friends of mine for decades. the owners of dgs are friends of mine for decades. i know the industry inside out. youre a johnny come lately. keep it real...
spanky,100 percent  agreed.  eliminating risk at the cost of decreasing my return is in my opinion the secret sauce.  i dont sweat games.  just like the energizer bunny my bankroll keeps going and going and going up.
spanky,to any aspiring pro bettors in nj: there is only one place to play  . why? because one day if and when you get good enough you can rest assured you will not be punished for winning.
spanky,lots of talk on the toledo total bad beat.... super sharps went u66/65 (loser)... semi sharps went u64/63 (loser)... sharp followers went u62/61 (loser).... theres this one sharp guy spanky who went u68.5 (winner)... price is everything
spanky,promoting sports betting to the masses is huge.  bookmakers need to extract more money from the masses in order to have some left over to pay me.  thank you svp for indirectly helping me support my family
PlusEVAnalytics,how worried are we about one directional parameter uncertainty this week? eg the market expects dak to play and if hes out the line will move a ton. will it move at all if/when hes confirmed in?
PlusEVAnalytics,"i had this bad bitch uptown she was whoa!
had me fucked up in the head i mean whoa!
bought the bitch diamonds and pearls i mean whoa!
shoulda seen them shits shinin' on her wrist whoa!"
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont believe so. he sees most books giving +8 and one outlier giving +9 and then he gets in his kia and steps on it. at least thats the impression that was given in the show.
aluckyaday,the problem with these kind of bodies is they tend to be biased towards the professional punters (a minority) needs rather than the recreational punter (the majority). only professionals have enough interest to spend time getting involved.
aluckyaday,if a large service that is not long term profitable can move lines in a liquid market does that not poo poo using closing line value as a general measure of success as it assumes market efficiency?
aluckyaday,"assuming i've done the maths correctly quite a bit of difference

singles actual 161 expected 217
doubles actual 507 expected 342
trebles actual 1412 expected 727
acca actual 3163 expected 4644
full cover actual 281 expected 141"
aluckyaday,i doubt you'd want a tout like me! i left the last private forum i was a member of after posting a distribution of t-scores for the forum members selections. it did not go down too well
aluckyaday,you think pinnacles ggr is more than bet365 about $3.6 billion dollars?  so a turnover of about $90 billion? to put that in perspective the gdp of the whole of costa rica was $57 billion in 2019
aluckyaday,basically tax/regulation too high in the uk for pinny and the like so i doubt they will be in the us in the near future. an often quoted answer is exchanges but again they struggle with regulation/tax.
theFirmAISports,im looking for all my #warriors friends..? we won a game tonight and i feel like im missing all the usual tweets and trash talk... draymond and his 7 points would be very disappointed with you all!
theFirmAISports,word of caution... all priors used for this particular model were adjusted at the team level based on coaching and player changes. who knows how the pieces will actually gel together when the real games kick off.
joeytunes2,"ok some of the win totals i played

joeyisaks,because every agent thinks any good bet is a bot i have decided to play games at a completely differwnr and random number every time so they dont hit me up with the bot texts  example a
EdMillerPoker,one thing i think we can all agree on is that machine learning is garbage and you definitely should not under any circumstances try to use it especially if you are competing with me in any way
EdMillerPoker,"this trend (you know who you are) of tweeting photos of peoples bare feet on airplanes/airports is lame and my working thesis is the main culprits behind the trend are closet foot fetishists

please just dont ok"
nonrandomalpha,you have some of the best content in the space dude. even have you are net negative currently take solace that we are net positive on the season many trades constructed using your analysis as the foundation.
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  counter-intuitive but all the pit/ten scenarios for the 6th seed are agnostic to this game. if pit wins both they get it. otherwise ten gets it if and only if they beat hou next week.
LeeSharpeNFL,regardless of the term it comes down to the same thing. data shows there's no relationship between your success on the past few plays and your success on the next one (once adjusting for general team strength).
LeeSharpeNFL,"it really sucks that this isn't democratized out.

even if you have competitive concerns and only want to post it after the game or the next day or whatever i see no reason this can't be public."
LeeSharpeNFL,"referring to this as a ""gender"" in a joking manner often serves to mock or disrespect people whose gender is not male or female. i would appreciate it if you would not make this kind of joke."
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah i  daily fantasy sports  see how people take this stuff that seriously.

i suspect aaron rodgers is fantastic human. i wish him no injuries a happy life and i hope his team gets many many losses."
whale_capper,college football preview podcast with the great  is the perfect preseason prep for the casual bettor and it will challenge the way you approach betting the win totals market even if you are a savvy vet. enjoy!
whale_capper,i acknowledge all of this... thought bryans stories were entertaining and informative and made for a fun podcast... open invite if you want to do a podcast this summer with us and dive into the tout industry
AndyMSFW,"gonna blame the jockey on that one... got caught in the laundry and folded.  sprints are tricky but going to take a few horses with heavy turf experience and one that hopefully paces with them.  
267 win"
AndyMSFW,finally: the glow on the lettering is in official john deere colors for you tractor aficionados  i'm also digging into the euro tour a bit and might have a couple plays on the scottish open.  everything here
AndyMSFW,i'm actually befuddled at how they could audit this.  i use ten different outs; i could go through and find the 3 i've historically done best at hand over those records and pretend the rest doesn't exist.
JoeyKnish22,i told the untold michigan state football program history of peds story a few weeks ago which people seemed to enjoy. so as the dantonio era burns to ash lets unearth some more local secrets shall we?
JoeyKnish22,a mac coaching staff not realizing the other team has 3 timeouts and taking a knee on 1st down then spending a timeout before 2nd down cause they have no clue what to do is peak maction.
JoeyKnish22,yeah not trolling. was a bit over the top here cause i disagreed with the bet/analysis. people should be self accountable for what they decide to tail anyway maybe i took the discussion a bit too literal.
JoeyKnish22,i know this isnt how i phrased the question. but right now id rather have brissett on his contract vs paying jimmy g as an elite qb. i dont believe theres a major delta between the two.
JoeyKnish22,if the next administration wants to have a federal sports gambling czar i would write a letter in support of your candidacy. not sure how seriously theyd take me recommending a pirate but you have my vote.
TheKostos,rockets are more than capable of beating the la teams and tatums ascension to superstardom changes the game in the east. lakers and bucks still favorites just saying its far from a lock. this aint golden state
TheKostos,already bet kansas and purdue  college basketball  and will definitely be adding more to the card looks juicy today. in the nba 100 percent  betting the rockets and eyeing two other games. wilder tonight in the fight
TheKostos,in all seriousness though screw utah. that is a team that will absolutely do nothing when it matters most. they play like curtain-jerking jabronis when they should win. losers. on my shit list for the foreseeable future
LockyLockerson,i think the gap between the two was so vast entering the week that even a blowout loss coupled with ou's narrow win couldn't swing things that much.  the bodies of work are still very far apart.
LockyLockerson,guess you'll just have to listen to the show and find out! (no but really yes to the first question 2nd question about -3.5 but that doesn't account for uga injuries/suspensions on offense that have just occurred)
LockyLockerson,add all that up you get 10-8 and since these are all widely-available -110 scenarios...congratulations!  i haven't lost you any money.  you've won a little.  i'll add to this thread in subsequent weeks since that was easy.
LockyLockerson,wait wasn't everyone bragging about grabbing the chargers spread in week 1 vs the colts because of luck and now every significant non-rivers player is in jeopardy of missing the game for la? quite the numbers grab.
LockyLockerson,"**wins 50 percent  of bets for a month**

me: nba betting is impossible all the pros say so

**wins every big bet for a week straight**

EliHershkovich,"it is  surreal that a manager gets canned after breaking a 108-year world series' drought plus three nlcs trips in five years.

not a cubs' fan but joe maddon completely changed the culture of their organization. salute."
EliHershkovich,"he (ortiz) was a great ambassador for our game. ... this guy was boston. he was boston strong.""

 insider joe girardi joined    to discuss david ortiz's importance to mlb on the latest edition of ""big time baseball."""
DannyParkins,i had filet and the duck at the all inclusive resort in the bahamas tonight so im good. i also won more at blackjack yesterday than i bet on clemson. this game could be going better though.
DannyParkins,that is a gambling hall of shame moment in niners/cards. dude on the ground just threw the ball backwards and the refs were the human embodiment of the shrug shoulders emoji and just gave em a touchdown.
DannyParkins,dont be extra mad newly mad or whatever at garpax because of tonight. the lottery is luck. they wouldnt be better at their jobs if they got lucky just like they arent worse because they got unlucky.
DannyParkins,today's show should have a bit of everything. we have len kasper crane kenney anything but baseball with mike zagursky (look him up) and patrick st esprit at 4pm + willson contreras might be stopping by.  #scorehouse
Gingfacekillah,"lavine is interesting because there is a large disparity between his ""on"" game and his ""off"" games. also chi coach keeps him in late even when the bulls are clearly going to lose which is somewhat uncommon."
Gingfacekillah,"totally. this has been written about for years. ""everyone"" knows this is supposedly a softer market. in fairness it has less available data and fewer games but who else other than sharps and quants are betting wnba?"
Gingfacekillah,with chris sale returning to form and cws slightly under performing in the h/r department hre total comes in just shy of the mark at 24. had the line movement just not the result. testing continues tomorrow.
logan_matthews9,"a fairly balanced course riviera's most distinguishing feature its kikuyu grass. not too much in the way of unique adjustments here.

the weather should be fantastic with a 5 percent  chance of rain for the entire tournament"
PikachuBets,"he's part of a company whose ultimate goal (one of many) is to become affiliates of sportsbooks and generate revenue from the  percent  losses of referred clients. do you understand why he roots ""for the dealer"" now?"
adamchernoff,"as usual the significantly better tuesday morning episode. 

lots of phoney monday morning line movement. which numbers hold and which numbers move back? plus a look back at one of the dumbest bets i ever made...

listen:"
adamchernoff,"anyone have experience sitting row 1 sideline at an nfl game? approximately between the 10 and 20. 

i get the ""sit higher to see the play and whole field thing"" but experience wise is it worth it?"
adamchernoff,sure but at ~225 of the the 520 bets that can be made per calendar year it bares mentioning. in 12 years of betting or booking the league i dont recall an eight week stretch like this.
adamchernoff,what brad is saying is spot on and would be echoed by many across the industry. it is quite unusual to see a 7-8 week stretch in nfl with little correlation between line movement and success ats.
adamchernoff,"stakes have been upped to a $200 amazon gift card. 

plain and simple just use the voice notes app on your phone and email the recording to adamchernoff 

best intro to the show wins the gift card."
adamchernoff,one of the worst in the nfl which is why things are a bit tighter to 7 than they are closer to 9 in my opinion. if this game is anywhere else it probably adjusts slightly more.
adamchernoff,despite the dominance of rayados and tigres i believe  is the best side in #ligabancomermx. success against the most difficult schedule and still playing below expectation. they have rightfully taken on money against  this afternoon all week...(cont)
adamchernoff,"another winning week for readers of my blog on  as the saints cash in comfortably. 

season record now 7-3 (+6.82x) profit. 

thanks to everyone who supported by clicking and taking the time to read. huge numbers again."
Ccon8181,just hard to cap izzo.. hell run it up sometimes. other times lets his side get run to prove a point. but he didnt even call a timeout until osu scored 16 straight and lead was 5.
Ccon8181,lakers were a huge disappointment yesterday. really thought theyd pull off the cover. ended the day 2-1 but was looking at a 3-0. back at it today. one play locked in a few others on the cusp.
kellyinvegas,all sorts of new things i didnt know about. i also wouldve never joined a league knowing about defensive players and total points wins the season. why even play h2h. just set your line up and go.
kellyinvegas,for reading a commercial? oh geez. so when i get a sponsor on  for viagra im going to be a doctor? or an alcoholic because i get sponsored by a liquor company. thats just a stretch dude.
kellyinvegas,nope. never done that. hence why on the  and  shows we talk about the current line on that specific day. just like on sunday i took the push with the browns when in reality i had -2.5.
ToddFuhrman,"another note on purdue banning sports betting for students and faculty...

the idea this decision protects athletes has the exact opposite effect.  discouraging money being wagered in regulated markets only empowers unregulated markets ripe for undesirable consequences"
TheCousinSal,football is back!  let us  try this. i'll start the season with a 1 million jermajesty bankroll to be spread out over the season.  i'll wager 1 million jermajesties on the ravens/bears over 34.5 tonight.  #halloffamegame #slowplay
TheCousinSal,i know paying bobby bonilla $1.19 million every july 1st seems unreasonable - but when you break it down this year he has as many rbis as steven matz robert gsellman and jeurys familia combined #whatasteal #letsgomets
TheCousinSal,degenerate trifecta consensus combine prop bet: allen faster 40 time than rosen (-220 on betonline).  ive actually seen cars lap josh rosen on the 405 freeway during rush hour. groban is a faster josh. you get it.
TheCousinSal,why is he the best dude on the planet?  because he lied to tannehills face when he told him hed be playing in a lot of afc championship games? seems like an insincere joker boy to me.
12Xpert,"he's not a jew hater  that is  perfectly obvious. his views allow the conspiracist nonsense that the world is run by ""dark forces"" to act as a breeding ground for antisemitism and that is what has happened."
12Xpert,"getting a second airing in 24 hours; people's capacity for expressing bias is fascinating.
""fundamental attribution error: the tendency to overestimate the action of others as being intentional rather than the product of random situational circumstances. """
12Xpert,i didn't say they excused them. i would say it would make it understandable. and i would also say it would therefore be wrong to judge such a person by the same standards they apply to others.
12Xpert,"a score for a team in a match is defined by:
win = 1-1/odds
not win = -1/odds
as set out in my contrarian betting system. remember colder teams could be the ones to bet on next."
12Xpert,these are not comparable problems in the same way that taleb distinguishes between firefighters and stock pickers. intuition is indeed a tried an tested evolutionary strategy in high validity domains where cause - effects links are clearer.
12Xpert,too bad. in 2008 i tuned down oddsportal/flashscore to be their uk bookie advertising programme manager because they wanted to do fixed fee rather affiliate rev share and i told them the bookies wouldnt go for that.
12Xpert,why should society not at least explore the possibilities rather than simply writing off a behaviour that almost everyone indulges in in some way or other (for purely evolutionary reasons) and those who facilitate it as evil?
12Xpert,"oh i  daily fantasy sports  doubt that for a minute. 
academic papers aside if overconfidence is so widespread in human behaviour we have to come up with an explanation for why it exists and hasn't died out."
12Xpert,"hard not to come to that conclusion when they carried on with a ""3rd party arrangement"" with the very football tipster affiliate that got the press writing the stories back in sept 2017 in the first place."
12Xpert,6 months since  moved their affiliate programme to  still in breach of tcs having failed to retag previous referrals allowing their partners to earn revenue from those. neither affiliate managers nor  interested. brand not fit for purpose.
12Xpert,"for sure if i now looked at my chart i showed earlier and said ""right we're gonna drop all the 3.5 percent s because they haven't contributed anything"" then that would be technical analysis and imo mistaken."
12Xpert,that is  right. i see as many as a third profiting from their lines but that doesn't imply they made it happen. the stuff i've done tells me the proportion that make it happens is very small.
mschwimer,we all know you dont actually believe this. if you did im offering you the greatest bet of all time!  why wouldnt you accept?  name 1 single reason besides you dont believe a word you have said.
RufusPeabody,because media outlets have published fluff pieces lending them legitimacy. and then schwim tried to use my name to give it credibility (i have no affiliation and do not support that business model in the least)
RufusPeabody,nothing like getting a spinnywheel for 2+ minutes for each bet only to be have it reduced to $100 or $200. i know i'm not their target audience but my  experience has not been particularly user-friendly.
jeffma,so listen to this podcast if you want to find me   right now. our location is disclosed and we will buy you and old fashion if you tell us promo code rufus is a dogs name
SportsCheetah,the quality of shots is going to stay. they literally pulled him the other night for taking a midrange jumper. team philosophy has changed big time. whether he can make 3s or not regularly diff story.
SportsCheetah,i pitched it as that (automated updates on scores pages in box scores etc) when i came on back in march. its still a baby but working on it with  and well see where it goes.
capjack2000,"pokerstars made me use the same name i had pre-black friday pre-uigea...i probably made it back in 2002 or so. 

however my bonus points or whatever they were called in the old pokerstars also carried over."
capjack2000,"i think they see it already. the wheels turn slowly but mobile registration and mobile banking within the app are definitely on the way for nv. 

if i had to guess i'd say within 6-9 months."
capjack2000,shops like that are useful for the rare times when they have a -105 on a side that you prefer...but for the most part these pricing games turn off recreational bettors who view them as deceptive.
capjack2000,draftkings is a kambi shop. i used labels that everyone would be familiar with in that chart. to compare apples to apples it would be kambi flutter and sbtech as the odds makers in that graphic.
capjack2000,correct and each of those companies already have a primary dance partner. when you add the ability for casinos to have a secondary skin partner you create more competition and more room for innovation for consumers.
capjack2000,"dig a little deeper into smarkets product. its not purely an exchange in the manner you are used to seeing. 

todays exchanges are aware of the liquidity issue and are taking innovative steps to overcome it."
capjack2000,no date for online launch yet. my guess is it will be several months before mobile betting will be live. hopefully faster than the 6 months between bm and mobile launches like we saw in pa.
capjack2000,the betting sheet pic is the opening number. there is no pic of the wager as he made it so for now we assume it was the same wager likely priced -210 / +150 or so.
capjack2000,fair point. i've heard it said in the past that nv requires a winner to be declared. however maybe like not booking nv college teams it was never a regulation. perhaps we can get  to weigh-in?
capjack2000,my take is an app that works on-property similar to what adelson tried at venetian and what some ms books are using for the mississippi mobile. i  daily fantasy sports  think it would jam other traffic.
capjack2000,"it used to be boilerplate in their ""how our projections work"" link which is at the bottom of each sports' projections. i didn't see it on a quick look today but here it is from 2015."

dinkinc,i have to take poker more seriously or give it up entirely. i am not aggressive enough and have some proplems with bet sizing  once again entering day two of a three day without enough bullets
robpizzola,the ravens and chiefs are elite teams not good teams. i won't let them off the hook for texans loss but they've also beaten the cowboys eagles and bills in the latter half of the season.
robpizzola,there are professional sprinters that pull up coming out of the blocks. you can be the best athlete in the world but there is still a higher risk of injury when you are pushing the limits.
RASPicks,we aren't planning to release many full game sides on the service this year. it will be focused on 2nd halves and full game/1st half totals. so we decided to give out some sides on here.

suuma810,"bills fans are blowing up my mentions for pointing out the difference in qbr between tyrod taylor  josh allen. 

turns out 'game-winning drives' to get to 13 14 or 17 points is a much better indicator."
suuma810,yeah  it is  funny: i am pointing towards a metric that he has used to hype allen last year and now that he can't counter with qbr he is just rolling out some old takes :)
suuma810,we took no +3.5 and smoked the opening line. great buy low spot on the saints after their slow start. falcons cluster injuries on defense no way to defend kamara  thomas. close game in the end.
ClevTA,skins are the slowest paced offense in the nfl in neutral game situations. they also are the 2nd run heaviest offense as well. i dont have an opinion here so thats all i can give u
ClevTA,name me all the pis ever called in nfl history on a hailmary. also a 1-1 situation with hayward isnt what u get in a hailmary with an entire defense back there. ill take my chances
ClevTA,barkley's run schedule is brutal in the near future. if u can get into the playoffs tho its cake with miami and wash. plus hunt may take some snaps away from chubb so its a risk
ClevTA,shred? thats a major stretch. he took a bunch of sacks including a safety bc he held onto the ball too long. his first pass should have been picked. and that 4th q was a mess
ClevTA,i said barring injury and he was signed mid season not prior to the season. im talking guys who signed after cut day and just stepped up to play a major role not bc of injury
CizzlingSports,"he also thumped his chest early in the season abt picking det back in july to win the division

oh wait he then picked minutes to win the division in sept.

PlusEVAnalytics,parameter uncertainty - bal/cle and ariz/sea could have the same spread they could have the same moneyline but they should not have both. the range of possible outcomes is much wider for bal/cle than for ariz/sea.
PlusEVAnalytics,the conclusion from the 4 percent  depends on your prior. if you flip a random coin and get enough heads that the p value is .01 do you conclude that the coin is biased or not?
PlusEVAnalytics,the more i think about it i would take a hole by hole approach. player with x raw ability score and y skill mix on hole z  distribution of score outcomes. no sketchy normality assumption needed.
PlusEVAnalytics,it may not seem like much but a secondary source that contributes 16.5 percent  (or even 4 percent !) of the signal can be extremely useful for bettors. stay tuned for upcoming international collaboration  feat.  !
aluckyaday,in theory under a uk licence targeting the vulnerable is legislated for. they are not allowed to do it and must have procedures in place to try and protect the vulnerable from the dangers of gambling.
aluckyaday,am i being completely stupid to think 1/2 is the wrong price for man city top 2 in the premier league? priors have their place but come on.... i'll probably look silly after leicester lose tomorrow!
aluckyaday,they also have more information than the analytics companies. that said we  daily fantasy sports  get to see the predictions of the best analytics companies. the likes of starlizard keep what they are betting on quiet!
aluckyaday,have you looked at their full history and staking joseph? they are not just betting 50/50 -105 propositions. parlays teasers the lot are in there. and they stake to level win rather than just level stakes.
aluckyaday,and in the betting arena european bookmakers have proved the opposite just about every book in europe has switched to the soft book model. some resisted but eventually they succumbed. the figures  daily fantasy sports  lie...
aluckyaday,everything the pm has done since he has been in power has been geared towards preparing from a general election and taking support away from the brexit party. this is just another step in that process.
aluckyaday,its a marketing game not a bookmaking one. the best marketing companies will win and the european companies have had lots of practice! it will be interesting to see if the american brands can fight back.
aluckyaday,but in a free global market where recreational punters have a choice of who to bet with they choose not to bet with exchanges. they prefer ease of use exotic bets and accumulators over low margins.
aluckyaday,i found this video interesting. marco blume talking about the pinnacle process and what goes in to setting odds from a data science point of view. the customer and trading models are often overlooked by betters.

EdMillerPoker,i agree with you but think there are ways to give out the same free $ that are more targeted/fun/newsworthy. neither here nor there. im not in any way critical of what pb is doing here.
EdMillerPoker,hey jackson just found your channel and im really enjoying it. my mom is a retired anglo-saxon and old norse scholar who (briefly) taught at texas tech. thanks for putting all the work into your videos.
EdMillerPoker,theyre making this point preemptively because they see this career pivot from her as an attempt to gain clout with a new group of people so that at a later date she can epic poker them
EdMillerPoker,i dont think any of the data feeds for american sports are accurate enough yet. this is no surprise as 98 percent  is way good enough for how the data has been used up til now.

nonrandomalpha,experience in those environments is definitely a material advantage. its not to say its a necessary component to win but its a mistake to discount the factor all together as if its just some noisy metric
nonrandomalpha,well done derrik. this was an incredibly salient breakdown prior to the chiefs game. this analysis kept us from overweighting the slay injury in our handicapping last week v kc. looking forward to your future content...
nonrandomalpha,the portfolios will be fully transparent; we also benchmark our performance v industry peers providing a better look at relative not just total performance - which can demonstrate we perform better than the next viable alternative.

LockyLockerson,inclined to agree just another set-up  that is  going to be a lot of people really mad.  to be fair in that spot i'd much rather watch lsu in a cfp semifinal than the other options.

TheCousinSal,professional gamblers do it all the time. its an excellent way to not lay points and cash if your team loses by a last second field goal. any more head-scratching observations - throw em my way.
TheCousinSal,finally getting caught up on the ncaa baseball tourney. wow - what a night for this dude! im just going to go ahead and assume that hes former atlanta braves fireballer john rockers son. great genes!
TheCousinSal,g.o.t. spoiler: as adorable as the couples dragon-ride was i give this episode a solid 5. i know they have to re-set all the plot lines but with only 5 episodes left shits gotta move faster.
TheCousinSal,not sure whats worse...mike mccarthy only having 1 timeout at the end of the game...or mike mccarthy choosing to punt on 4th and 2 knowing he only had 1 timeout at the end of the game.
TheCousinSal,just saw that the patriots under belichick are 309-0 in games where they have a kick return + fumble return for a touchdown and are playing against a qb who cant complete a 13 yard pass.

12Xpert,"did i ever say liquidity was random?
and if you're suggesting it should be if performance outcomes are random why would that imply that liquidity has to be random. liquidity is not related to t/z scores."
12Xpert,a lot of noise but the bigger the bet365 price value relative to pinnacle (pre-closing odds collected for football-data) the more bet365 shortens thereafter by closing. sample of 4875 odds from this season's european league football.
12Xpert,honourable aspirations but its how they are implemented. if people feel like they dont have a voice on that and are being dictated to by an elite who claim to know better then theres something wrong.
12Xpert,i suspect the moaning is about the lack of consistency and in that respect i will be surprised if var solves it whether because different fas interpret rules differently or simply refuse to adhere to them.
12Xpert,i guess the real problem is that on a case by case basis we have no idea what the true odds should be so we have no idea how accurate something else is relative to it.
mschwimer,no one trusts what exactly? that we wont pay the money? we already offered  that we would put money in escrow in advance and on their terms. what else do you need to trust? im confused.

RufusPeabody,i cant visit arlington cemetery this year but today i still remember general welborn dolvin (or as i called him granddad) who was a highly decorated lieutenant general who fought in ww2 korea and vietnam.
RufusPeabody,i think  it is  a little disingenuous to claim what the bankroll necessary was after-the-fact. if you invest in a fund you  daily fantasy sports  invest an unspecified amount that you find out about later.
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  do an espn show at all. and what i was paid when i worked part-time for espn that one year made up less than 10 percent  of my income that year.
RufusPeabody,ok im going to share the craziest idea ive had. it started out as just a vegetable draft but i think you could make it an food draft/league. bear with me heres the premise (thread):
capjack2000,"after extensive analysis with  were prepared to set the alfojack power number at:

$480m projected betting handle in nj in november. 

check back at 2pm et to see how close we got (or didnt get)."
capjack2000,"however that doesn't mean sportsbooks shouldn't play into that notion and promote their bookmakers as the other side of your wager. 

us bookmakers have a lot of personality and charisma. want an example? (next tweet)"
capjack2000,you're asking someone who regularly has 6-figure days and originates huge market moves to document his record when he's neither selling anything or making picks. i  daily fantasy sports  think you understand how this works.
capjack2000,drink tickets are a foreign concept in most if not all non-nv sportsbooks. considering the drink comp is the most effective tool in the history of predatory gambling i just  daily fantasy sports  get it.
capjack2000,correct. penn gets a ~4.7 percent  stake in thescore in exchange for thescore getting various skin rights for penn properties. there's also a revenue share for profits from those sports betting operations run by thescore.
capjack2000,"current check of room rates show prices higher than they were for super bowl weekend.

capjack2000,yes. although i should point out  doesn't offer bank account withdrawals. you have to cash out in person at their physical nj books. they should consider changing that imo. they stand alone on that island.
dinkinc,its the first half.  dodgers likely would have moved on if they could have scored a run after the second inning but no one called out their hitters.  three runs doesnt win too many games
robpizzola,"the raptors played a game like that this week and all we focus on is the incredible comeback. leafs play a game like that and ""this team can't compete in the playoffs"".  it is  dumb."
robpizzola,its 2019... why cant they just play a buzzer or something when the play clock hits zero? or even just some sound into the referees ear piece? why does the nfl make this so difficult.
robpizzola,yep  it is  been a trend for a few years now. none of the major sites mark it as a neutral site game like they do with other sports so i can understand the confusion.
robpizzola,thats a good question. they definitely should have been coached not to touch a player in that situation. saints at home in the dome though... id be shocked if they didnt get a quick whistle.
VegasRefund,cant explain how much i appreciate all the loyal followers out there. i legit havent looked at my comments in a while now so please dont think im not appreciative.. ill recognize you all soon.
VegasRefund,my previous tweet is based on a theoretic 2-3 points being factored into the home teams spread. had nothing to do with whos covering or if the rams actually have a tangible hfa or not.
ProfessorShine,again the promotions blur these lines.  if you trust one part of a place like tan or  it is easy to trust them all.  it shouldnt be an issue to point out the obvious bullshit.
suuma810,"colts had two punt return touchdowns and the panthers turned three red zone trips into 3 points.

i dont feel entirely bad about that car +7 loss.

next weeks jax line is gonna be interesting."
suuma810,das problem liegt bei deiner vorstellung des begriffes analytics. daten knnen subjektiv (se hour oft der fall) oder objektiv erhoben werden. diese daten auf muster zu untersuchen und erkenntnisse abzuleiten ist vereinfacht ausgedrckt der analytics-prozess.
suuma810,the proof is that they couldn't run vs chi's aggressive defense (gurley 2.5 ypc) and weren't playing with a lead in any phase of the game to be able to lean on the run game.
suuma810,something is still wrong with the 2018 premium database. the estimated wins column in the total dvoa dataset is wrong. e.g. 0.9 estimated wins for the rams. they are also 31st in with touchdown  dvoa.
ClevTA,its hard to know how good he really is. i do like he believes in play action and analytics but i have no idea if he can run a team. hes def worth a look
ClevTA,as someone who was in wyoming i couldnt contain my laughter. a 50+ yd  field goal  not only on 4th and 2 but in 1 degree weather with a college kicker down 7. truly amazing
ClevTA,yikes. browns literally set an nfl record last year thru 3 gms with almost 4 takeaways per gm yet they couldnt win a gm bc tyrod completed 49 percent  of his throws. he was awful
ClevTA,right so for me based on his situation and talent/coaching in 2017 vs today i think about a 4.5 rank improvement is fair. hes still not good but hes better than bottom quartile of starters
CizzlingSports,it is  not about solvency;  it is  about whether they make a business decision to pay no questions asked or to instead only pay subs willing to jump through the litigation hoops in the t'sc's
spanky,"thanks. 

long term closing line value implies long term profits. long term profits does not necessarily imply long term closing line value but in most cases it does. your tennis analysis is certainly an anomaly."
spanky,i did it part time for years before i took the plunge.  once i started making more betting than at my regular job for 2+ years is when i quit and started betting full time.
spanky,"youre not a spanky guy?!? 

of course spanky loves spanky.  who else is gonna love me? bookmakers sure dont. 
wannabe pros in twitter world dont.

keep tracking the fraud cappers. you do a good job."
spanky,edge over other participants is meaningless. the strong will survive. the early bird catches the worm.   has an api that allows lighting fast bot betting because they want to write as much business as possible...

PlusEVAnalytics,my guesses would be less liquidity in betting markets + more spread of sophistication in market participants. the financial markets have sharp money and passive money but relatively little square money compared to betting markets.
PlusEVAnalytics,thank goodness for mathematical ignorance. these guys were really able to convince a judge that they won $5 million by making thousands of bets into a 39 percent  hold product by getting really really lucky!
aluckyaday,what they said was nothing new. if you remove restrictions i believe books will become pinnacle clones relying on geographical restrictions to give them larger margins to cover regulation costs. is that good for recreationals?
aluckyaday,it is   . yep you need to look at the whole population past and present. rather than just the ones at the top. even pyckio remove historical records so you can't do a fair comparison.
aluckyaday,can't bet with them i wonder did they just forget to update him or did their trader genuinely think that was his price? i took 25s with hills before your post thats why i asked!
aluckyaday,"i would guess they would not advertise the other side of the bet and cover it in their terms and conditions ""other options available on request"". they are experts at this kind of thing ."
aluckyaday,still seems to be a lack of consistency. some want you to chop off a finger and send it in to prove who you are others just a click of a button and its done!
aluckyaday,"take a look at what recreational punters can achieve when betting near the front of the market.  i'd be surprised if you could get anywhere near a statistically significant 33 percent  roi backing your ""outsiders""."
theFirmAISports,shots fired...but do they tell you that they started out as sports bettors way before they became data scientists? and do they actually know the limitations of using a.i. and machine learning for sports betting...
theFirmAISports,"super bowl
nfl games - picks with probability of success:

patriots -2.5 (53 percent ) win

44-26-1 overall (63 percent  win rate)

its been an extremely successful season! now to fine tune my nba model!"
joeytunes2,nothing like betting old trends that everyone knows like a d-bag  imagine him calling anyone a idiot to there face. all 5 free throw 1 of him.  took a shitty job by a hack site.
joeytunes2,offshore is going nowhere. wynn opens early also. but as soon as cris opens they move there way. openers aren't really relevant at 2k a pop. but definitely  agree with rufus that they free ride..
joeyisaks,even if its inevitable the point is to not spread it to others as best as possible and hope we get it spread out over 18 months rather than 2 weeks where hospitals are overwhelmed
EdMillerPoker,"dont start a company just because you love the work

start a company so you can credibly dispense bite-sized wisdom nuggets on the internet elevating startup culture by conflating it with generally recognized human virtues"
EdMillerPoker,correct me if im wrong but i cant  believe theyre trying to attract slot aps. its just that the vulturable game mechanics also encourage non-ap play for mostly the same reasons they encourage ap play.
EdMillerPoker,i have extensive experience with the nfl realtime data feed and in my opinion sportsbooks are not being cheap if they  daily fantasy sports  buy it. it isn't yet good enough to meet their needs.
EdMillerPoker,gonna have the same customer acquisition/retention problems we saw in  daily fantasy sports  (but to a lesser degree bc even the euro model game is already much better designed than  daily fantasy sports  ever was)
EdMillerPoker,when i copy-and-paste the writings of others i use ctrl-h search and replace to remove any references to them by name and then so that they will not speak of it i remove their tongues
GolcondaFund,"top 10 sure.
top 5 maybe.
best in league?
no way.
jackson and jeffery are on their way out of their prime.
jeffery 9 12 16 13 games last 4 years.
superbowl  year was outlier."
nonrandomalpha,"brett k. you're a smart dude but this is egregious. having jimmy g. so low is going to look like handicapping malpractice by season's end. when jimmy actually plays he's an easy top 5. 

 thoughts?"
LeeSharpeNFL,"is hidden yards essentially taking an epa-like model converting it to ""yards"" and then subtracting the raw yards of the offense? wasn't sure exactly what you meant by this when listening to bet the process."
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  using 2016-2018 data to create the expectation for 2019. that should somewhat trend upward over time though i haven't looked to see if these year the effect is higher than normal or not.
LeeSharpeNFL,it is in play but a lot has to go right for you. unlikely ne loses to mia or cin. that means you have to win out including beating pit and ne on the road.
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah me either. it makes total sense to me why  it is  being done i just feel like some signal is being lost. but as you say i  daily fantasy sports  see a better solution.
LeeSharpeNFL,its leaves the impression - even though it doesn't explicitly state this - that jackson's fakes are successful *because* he blends in because of skin color and otherwise he wouldn't have the success he has.
LeeSharpeNFL,also you  daily fantasy sports  wait 2-3 years to evaluate draft picks. decisions should only be judged based on information available at the time the decision was made. you judge the process not the outcome.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""indisputable"" is probably too high of a standard but  it is  also true that officials have additional vantage points that cameras didn't capture and throwing that evidence out and reviewing from scratch also seems wrong."
whale_capper,you guys seemed to enjoy this for the nba so here is the nfl snapshot... time-decay wt avg over l4 games calc'd the misfit between market expected performance and actual performance in terms of z-score...
whale_capper,that for sure is a factor and people are high on how the heat have looked without jb but  it is  going to be tough for them to replicate what phi did defensively last night
AndyMSFW,i think  it is  probably a fair line as they might just pack it in and call it a season i personally  daily fantasy sports  like throwing more money on a team and doubling down.
TheKostos,the most underrated game of eli's career is the 2011 nfc title game at san francisco. he got his ass kicked by justin smith and the niners and kept getting back up. unreal performance. #hof
TheKostos,anyone interested in yeezys ive got a number of pairs (350/500/700) in sizes 10 or 10.5 im looking to move. original box for almost all and all in great condition. hit me up if interested
TheKostos,im max betting either the vikings or niners in the nfc title game bc theres no way the football gods will allow either the shitty seahawks or shitty packers to play for a super bowl
LockyLockerson,brooklyn has gotten to -3 just before tip-off if you happen to believe in the model.  and there is absolutely not a good reason you should believe in it yet aside from my sales pitch.
LockyLockerson,also happy to announce i've bet on almost every atrocious fbs team in the country this season but there's one i haven't and that will change saturday.  holding out for maybe a half point more.
DannyParkins,come on. every reporter had it including a bunch of local chicago reporters. this clearly came from the sox. which is fine just a different pr strategy than i would've taken. not a huge deal.
DannyParkins,my wife a diehard clemson fan and alum upon hearing the carrier dome holds less than 50000 people just laughed and said thats like ku. in case you were wondering how my night is going.
DannyParkins,damn darvish. 14 strikeouts through 6 innings. just struck out the side in the 6th after len  jd debated if hed even go back out there to start the inning. that was an incredible performance.
DannyParkins,baseball is a rollercoaster. theo says that all the time. fans ride the rollercoaster. im a fan. im an analyst. i can report. im capable of wearing many different hats and containing multitudes. are you?
DannyParkins,my point is this nucleus makes up a 95 win average team over the last 4 years. they might struggle to win 85 this year. they are a wildly frustrating group of underachievers right now.
DannyParkins,about ready to go here... my guests are old friend  at 10 am ct and one of the best football analysts in the game  at 11am ct. 888-maddog6 to call in.  let us  do this.
DannyParkins,id keep your radio on  today. weve got pirates broadcast fight reaction crazy st louis audio on darvish  in studio at 3 when the deadline passes  at 4. all the baseball weirdness you can handle.
DannyParkins,coming up its jed hoyer with  btw with a cubs day game tomorrow im sitting in with mully for  id go to bed now to get ready but i still have todays show to do.

what just happened?
holy f$@
 what the fuck 
we traded up!?!?!"
chadmillman,"it is  cute (aka amateur hour) that  celebrated after winning one of the three bets we made in our  showdown. 
ftr i had:

colts +5.5---l

saints -8--???"
chadmillman,correct. but we do keep track during the week of steam moves reverse line moves and at what books (generally sharp or catering more to public) so we can id who is on what side.
Gingfacekillah,2/n the numbers and information coming out of china about a month ago were concerning and appeared (to me) to be ominous.  i began making reasonable preparations based on the following ad hoc risk assessment.
Gingfacekillah,tentatively scheduled for release august 17th to ensure ill have time to deliver a quality work. however im working hard to exceed that timeline. i *think* ill have it complete by the end of june.
Gingfacekillah,yeah it was helpful considering all my prior modelling and stats work had been in excel. i found it decent for translating functions you already know how to do in a spread sheet to r.
Gingfacekillah,^^ bill benter did this to beat horse racing in the early 90's. obviously there have been significant improvements in modelling strategies since but this is a good place to start boosting a model's competitiveness.
Gingfacekillah,"better question: why should universities take government funding yet not be required to protect charter rights? cdn courts deem universities to not constitute ""government action/agents"" despite being largely funded by tax dollars. needs to change."
Gingfacekillah,tor/gsw game shows how effective a team can be against the warriors when defense forces 3 point shooters in from the arc. gsw shooting ice cold when stripped of wide-open 3 looks. #nba #handicapping #sharpaction
logan_matthews9,online right now i normally do ~6 tables at .5/1 enough that im interested but not at a high enough level that i cant play while having a few drinks and not lose my ass
logan_matthews9,hard disagree. he still has the best passing range of anyone in this pool (maybe second to adams) and his physical fall off is overstated. i saw nothing in the last game that proves this
PikachuBets,the nightmare before christmas should be renamed the nightmare before thanksgiving and remade as a sobering documentary of traveling in any major american city on this day the pilgrims have forever cursed us with. fuck
PikachuBets,4 games going on at 12p on a magnificent tuesday but the one i have action on is the only one without a working stream on all these websites. gambling gods are out for me
PikachuBets,like we just shitpost while waiting for lines or if  it is  a boring day or if there's been a couple games worth of bullshit. we ain't out here tryna get a master's thesis done
PikachuBets,market got flooded with a bunch of sharps looking to make a quick buck last summer. totals market was out of control with steam switching directions like 2-3x a day. hope that doesnt happen again
PikachuBets,why does he need to do this. and no sometimes numbers do move that quickly. just check db next time a mover bets. oh wait...you prob dont know what that is let alone own it
adamchernoff,"this morning i talked ratings adjustments to teams after week 8 and broke down the week 9 market. 

next sunday will feature the spot for many handicappers. but is the number really worth the upside...?"
adamchernoff,"first handicap of the week up on the podcast this week along with the full market rundown. 

five bets in total in for the week in what is turning out to be a decent sunday."

there are four basic strategy teaser legs available on the college football card today. 

listen to the the simple handicap this morning for details.

adamchernoff,"i think it is really important they do - and i think it is a good thing. too much agreement or one person reiterating what someone else said. 

whats the main reason you like minnesota?"
Ccon8181,"back to work tonight.. waited it out as the line climbed. time to buy back on the inflation. not going to get a better number in this one. 

#chargers +6 -110 

#mnf #kcvslac #boltup #nfl"
Ccon8181,i know its disappointing but remember im trying to show you how i makes a living at this. its a long game. and if youre on board youll see we grind out profits long term.
Ccon8181,another winner got the solid +7 number beating the market on a prime time game. moves our season record to 6-1. selective strong sides. like retweet and follow to keep the free winners coming #skininthegame
Ccon8181,tough look for the #pac12  were bad last year and one of their sleeper teams this year getting smoked by #hawaii . its early but the conferences reputation for being soft looks accurate again. #azvshaw
kellyinvegas,yeah but not from professional athletes. i had the same question as soon as i read it. shouldnt be a violation. theyre headphones. but shocked this isnt a violation of sorts per their ridiculous standards.
kellyinvegas,and it wasnt my best bet buddy. try and keep up. was one of three on my card that week 2-1 yesterday. i know math is hard. but 1 best bet for 15 weeks. 12-2-1.
ToddFuhrman,i still cant figure out why all the #got fanboys out there cant admit this season has lacked everything weve come to expect from the show; its ok to be salty about not meeting expectations
ToddFuhrman,i think the whole thing is comical and a joke. mlb is out of touch with a lot of whats going on and until i see this actually implemented dont thing it changes a ton
TheCousinSal,ive bore witness/been a part of some great pranks in my time but this one where freddie kitchens is thrown in as an nfl head coach might shoot to the very top of the list.
12Xpert,"yes.
yes.
no it doesn't start at 5 percent . 5 percent  is the sort of number that voulgaris ended up at after the paradox of skill in betting markets started to rear its head."
12Xpert,it worked for me although not as reliable as football from memory. perhaps this was because this was based on atp/wta data only no challengers or futures as was the case for miguel's data set
12Xpert,"the  is very much against the normalisation of gambling in society. it doesn't take much to find examples of their journalism against it; ""gambling is always dangerous"" for example. the labour party is joining them."
12Xpert,well i  daily fantasy sports  want your world to end so  let us  see.  it is  really not much extra both to include them. just anted to make sure they were still wanted by people.
12Xpert,to conclude i still  daily fantasy sports  see strong evidence for systematic profitability being available beyond the costs of playing simply by exploiting squares' cognitive biases. people are stupid but not that stupid. on average.
12Xpert,you shouldn't have to. they should tell you what you have done and given that for nearly all it will be because they beat the starting price that should be in their terms and conditions.
JambosPicks,"we address the bankroll question on the  faq page which was posted before the site went live. go to the faq page and find the question: ""what kind of bankroll do i need to have?"""
mschwimer,listen for our game of the week. won with the saints last week (3-3 overall) and our prop record currently 58 percent  and +5.8 units. 8 props on the podcast. all for the game tonight.
mschwimer,our record says otherwise. either closing line value is not best way to judge or we are lucky to the tune of more than 1 in a million. one of the statements must be true.
mschwimer,sure. our record speaks for itself. we started this free for everyone 8 months ago. we have made 2700 recs and are +172 units vs. betcris and +140 units vs. the closing line of cris.
mschwimer,have no fear. will be back on monday. todays plays will be up shortly. have lots of action. you can see everything i am on at . 15sec to register and its free for everyone.
RufusPeabody,"per the google machine air force holds (or at least held) the fbs time of possession record of 45:14 in 48-14 win over georgia state in 2016.

currently leading top battle 36:23 to 13:38."
RufusPeabody,thanks! they somehow have 11 more games. i didn't have numbers for the two week 0 games but not sure what 9 other games i'm missing. who knows maybe those have errors of 40.
RufusPeabody,this is a horrible take. many things are correlated to a very small degree (ie favorite -7/over 41). its certainly not black and white and the onus should absolutely not be on the bettor.
RufusPeabody,i mean its your picks not mine. but . if i polled bettors it would be a different story. but that is typical tout grading. not trying to be an ass just being honest.
RufusPeabody,the third place guy could've won if james had wagered more than $1400 and both he and emma got final jeopardy wrong. betting only $1399 guaranteed james he would win if emma answered incorrectly.
RufusPeabody,but can you predict who the 20 percent  of clients are going to be going forward? no. can you predict who your winning clients are going to be going forward? books believe they can.
RufusPeabody,had my worst week with matchups (pga/euro combined) all year...by a lot. and managed to salvage it a bit with korhonen outright and homa outright after r2. so we were complete oppo in resulta
RufusPeabody,right. sample size of games since the new rule isnt really sufficient to get a true sense of it. need to dive a little deeper in predicting the things that will predict it essentially.
jeffma,converting that first down which is probably better than 50 percent  effectively ends the game. and without converting your are still two scores up.  do you have a good win prob analysis of this?
jeffma,halloween edition of  where i work on improving my audio  talks thru the college playoffs and gives us a non-alabama futures pick and we delve into why shitty gambling markets arent actually prediction markets
jeffma,and this has nothing to do with who is smart and who is not. its legitimately trying to understand the public/non-public analysis. since i got called out on it when i did  this week
capjack2000,interesting. seems inefficient. either let ti manage both or let wh manage both. maybe he feels having two different sets of lines will protect him from the crippling variance that $300 bettors can inflict.
capjack2000,"considering every time i talk or text with spanky the conversation lasts for well over an hour i think he'd have no trouble finding topics. 

my concern is the content might be ""too good."""
capjack2000,live from #g2e : my mother has trouble figuring out how to get the cap off her bingo dauber. not sure how shed take to bingo on a tv while a robot calls numbers.
capjack2000,hey ladies...do you like a man who can dress down for any occasion? how about a guy who wears shorts in the winter? need someone to yell at your tv? come meet him here...
capjack2000,curious if there is a posted limit you'll take on the yes/no lakers wager   this is the kind of competitive innovation that is going to drive sports betting forward in the next few years.
capjack2000,the price movements and pool sizes of both nj horse racing exchange and in-race betting made it obvious you were betting against european syndicates. that alone made it very unattractive to any potential bettor.
capjack2000,agreed. mgm czr wh all dealing a dime line. i hope pb gets on that bus.  it is  their first day of baseball in the us so i'll cut them some slack for now.
capjack2000,first reaction to daily wager: frenetic pace. lots of information on the screen to also be talking at such a high pace. only a few minutes in. maybe ill get more used to this.
dinkinc,what was the last thing he took the blame for ?  anything ?  ever ??? all of his business failures ?  his charity ripoff .. his mocking the disabled ??   name one thing ??
dinkinc,so you are saying because you think the united states is better than belgium it is the best.... well the marlins are better than the tigers so i guess they are the best too
robpizzola,ive never enjoying rewatching a series as much as game of thrones. there are so many easter eggs and so much foreshadowing that i missed the first time around. the writing really is brilliant.
RASPicks,"if it is a fact that ""many pros subscribe"" then it is also a fact (evidenced by lack of line movement) that none of said ""many pros"" bet anything on any of your picks."
RASPicks,agree but still depends on terms and ability to get down.  if i can buy a pick for $30 and bet 3k on it would be better than giving 50 percent  to the originator.
RASPicks,btw if you'd like to see how the releases work and have a better idea of how viable the service is i would be happy to set you up with a comp.  good luck.
RASPicks,unless your access to outs is not in line with your bankroll i am surprised anyone would criticize the size of the nfl preseason market.  it is far from a joke.  even in vegas.
VegasRefund,"holy **** i had no idea this was happening.. and literally am speechless right now. i cannot thank  and everyone who made this happen enough. utter shock. love you all. 

l field goal ggggg"
VegasRefund,please do not walk into work today telling all your friends that your fantasy football team made the finals. they do not care no body does. especially if they arent even in your league.
ProfessorShine,sure. but doesnt help large respected media companies help to fool people. there are  laws in other financial sectors that punish predatory marketing.   i expect some laws to catch up to sports legalization eventually
suuma810,"after 13 targets  9-85-0 in weeks 1-5 duke johnson saw 19 targets for 13-143-2 over the last four games. he ranks 4th in receiving dvoa among qualified rbs.

ClevTA,the good news is garrett thought it was better to go for it on 4th and 11 than 4th and 8 from the 11 with a chance to tie. its just so so awful
ClevTA,but strength of record etc in your case would all go for georgia plus georgia would be sec champs. and theyd be doing all of this while ranked one spot ahead of bama already.
ClevTA,adjust for pass defenses faced. baker has faced zero bottom 10 pass ds in the nfl so far. lets wait till end of the year to see where his best gms will stack up
ClevTA,come on u know better than to use total first downs as an indicator stat. den 1st downs per play 30.2 percent  browns 28.7 percent . the big plays for den skewed those numbers
ClevTA,for sure. major weapon. shanahan using play action  misdirections vs our lbs is really scary. we already know he will scheme these guys open. just need to hope our ends attack quickly without staley
ClevTA,ugh. it was 4 doors down from me tho. i was living 100 feet away from a breaking bad situation. was a crazy weekend to say the least. so glad im leaving next month
spanky,"not surprised wilson lin.  cut me down severely on all college sports.  they have also limited and banned others like  . 

they came in with a lot of sizzle. unfortunately there was no steak."
spanky,if only every sportsbook produced something like this and honored them for all customers the industry would be better from it. kudos  for leading the way despite being the new kid on the block.
spanky,great handle. i bet about 70k myself and was happy to help soften the blow for the book losing 20k.  it was a great time and just like frosty ill be back again someday.
spanky,i hear ya brother... at least the senior center got the money and the casino still had to pay.... if the casino woulda got the money back that would have really been a travesty!
spanky,butch who used to work at  is now working at    he couldnt stand  dressmaker policy of kicking so many people out.  hes happy to be working for a real bookmaker who welcomes all customers!!!
spanky,unfortunately im banned from betting at all  . maybe one day if im bored ill gather a bunch of guys and try for a personal best and get booted in less than 3 days
PlusEVAnalytics,whats not clear about this? nobody cares whether trump is guilty of anything. its only about what each juror will do to help themselves. yes its obvious by now but isnt it so wrong?
PlusEVAnalytics,"music math inspired by   . 

log(3+3+3+3+2+2) / log(2) is an integer which is why this somewhat complex rhythm sounds so aesthetically satisfying. music is full of 16s 32s 64s if you listen for them..."
PlusEVAnalytics,its not absurd at all - we live in a world of incomplete information and books are extremely vulnerable to adverse selection. with exchanges you trade the adverse selection problem for a liquidity problem.
aluckyaday,how is the breakup of the uk going to happen if the uk government  daily fantasy sports  allow it. are you predicting a civil war? do we need to arm ourselves and build bunkers?
aluckyaday,getting off topic but what happens to disputed bets in the us? is it solely down to the regulator so you have no recourse through the courts if they find in the bookmakers favour?
aluckyaday,the length of the list surprised me. the number of teams to have played in the premiership is quite a bit bigger than what i would have guessed. not that i watch much football
aluckyaday,you say that but if millions takes loss leading prices and nothing else then they will go broke. you  daily fantasy sports  have to be that smart to only bet top price on oddschecker.
aluckyaday,simulation with my real history (once i'd worked out how to stop the data table refreshing hanging excel every time i did anything) 25 or more happened 5.94 percent  about a 1 in 17.
aluckyaday,interesting that they have listed betting activities as an acceptable source of wealth though. i wonder if they would still open an account for you if you sent them a betfair premium charge notice
aluckyaday,those with a winning single would be unlikely to collect their winning though. unless of course they knew what they were doing and trying to get away with it. now there is an idea....
aluckyaday,say i had a sportbook with 50 billion turnover a 5 percent  hold so 2.5 billion ggr. my net profit is 500 million. do i want a 2 percent  losing punter on my books?
aluckyaday,thanks. just luckyi took a bit of profit when he went odds on put me back in front for the vuelta (not been great so far). but a win would obviously of been better!
aluckyaday,its started already! is there any reason why someone is still wanting to back gove at 70? a rule somewhere where one of the candidates can be replaced with the next in the ballot?
aluckyaday,be difficult to stop firms using loss leaders. if they restrict stakes they can hedge the liability for not that much cost. probably cheaper than other ways of acquiring new accounts. good business practice?
aluckyaday,although i would think someone like rufus should be able to use his profile to build relationships with books. i'll scratch your back... good on him if his principles stop him from doing that.
aluckyaday,that is why my hedging was in quotes. winner at 4/1 becomes less of a winner at 9/2! that said i  daily fantasy sports  think the overround issue came from the price of tiger.

joeytunes2,no one wants to free roll you. i ded dont steal your work. we dont bet cow tipping for 100. i'm the most stand up guy.  anyone i owe money to please come forth.
joeyisaks,162 games means everything in terms of judging best team .. the 3 out of 5  and 4 out of 7 playoffs is a random roll of the dice made for a tv event
EdMillerPoker,i put a bug in our baseball for the better part of a year because i selection biased and that was not good and my mistake was asking a question where being wrong mattered
EdMillerPoker,not sure what opposite means there and im no business expert but the way this industry approaches marketing has always felt insane to me and completely out of step with basically every other industry.
EdMillerPoker,tbh i find thinking in this industry to be remarkably binary. customers are either mugs or shrewdies. you're either a full participant in the cpa arms race or you're relying completely on natural discovery.
EdMillerPoker,"a never fail human thing

if you answer a question and anticipating the followup question you go ahead and answer that one too they will ignore the second answer and ask their followup question"
EdMillerPoker,im no expert on what common core is or isnt but every time i see one of these videos about how it sucks i think wow thats how i do it in my head
EdMillerPoker,i think the error bars on the value of real-time data now are huge. can see a world where  it is  not worth much and can see a world where  it is  a monster
nonrandomalpha,"public pounding a bad team on the road vs i  daily fantasy sports  care who is unpalatable. i usually will avoid betting these types of games which is essentially gambling on ""who is worse?"""
nonrandomalpha,agree - unfortunately mullens love affair with franks was going prohibit getting him out any other way. if mullen was worthwhile franks would be healthy and not even starting. a win win for all.
nonrandomalpha,if they in fact have an average defense then yes it is an overreaction. its not clear how meaningful dismantling the dolphins means at this stage - and im wagering that its not much...
nonrandomalpha,franks' confidence level is still high because he's delusional. not an ideal quality for a starting qb in the sec. the dude can't learn from his mistakes and mentally brain dead. free emory jones.
LeeSharpeNFL,"nagy saying ""mitch has grown"" and then citing an example of the week 3 game vs. washington while just pretending the whole week 16 game vs. kansas city didn't happen is pretty yikes though."

both offenses played like crap but the games were close and more things broke the packers' way.

(but seriously kudos to the chargers for not giving in to that while the cowboys signed elliott to a huge extension.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,agree they are underpaid relative to the amount of value that they add but that doesn't mean  it is  correct for teams to pay them more than they have to to acquire their services.
whale_capper,thought the over was a good look on the opener but the more i break down the game the more i believe bal will try to play keep away and plays into an under
whale_capper,it is pretty consistent year over year to have preseason games land in the 30s... most due to game plan approach and replacement level talent on the field for huge portions of the game
AndyMSFW,"working on making sure my model was still functional and some averages weren't calculating properly due to some null cells...  had to delete savannah state from the model today sweet dreams sweet princes.

AndyMSFW,"i think the market did a nice job adjusting last year as it is prone to do.

weeks 1-4 the over was 68-58 (avg total 45.8)

JoeyKnish22,took a rouge vikings +9 (-120) this morning. i hate zimmer. i hate cousins. i hate everyone ive ever known from minnesota. i hate this bet. but had to play it at the price.
JoeyKnish22,put his qb in a game he likely shouldnt have started and definitely shouldnt have still been in in turn potentially costing him millions (no shot at #1 pick now). he should feel bad.
JoeyKnish22,i mean coaches can barely get in game strategy right; so season strategy is probably a long way off but maybe hire some asian math guys like the colts  i do not know .
JoeyKnish22,add in the university and sports program already had a culture full of cover ups and lying. and the numerous former players who admitted use or were widely known to use. there ya go.
JoeyKnish22,theres ppl out there like  and  who thought jimmy g was too handsome or maybe didnt like brissett because he was black and thought my take was absurd. but the stats speak for themselves.
JoeyKnish22,honestly i just saw o75.5 is what is widely available at most places atm lol and didnt want to recommend taking something thats moved 5+ yards from open if its worse (higher) than 75.5.
JoeyKnish22,i look forward to taking my business to indiana illinois and canada since michigan cant get a deal done.  and  continue to fail the sports betting community and the michigan consumer with political gridlock.
JoeyKnish22,theyd flash to my section after a rake. be like empty dead silent my dad sitting there annoyed hes gotta be there all day. broadcast would think im the most miserable cheap fuck alive.
TheKostos,they turned it over on 4th and 1 from the 2 and the kicker left four easy points on the board. and saints kicker went 4/4. never should have even come to the end
TheKostos,funny he's my mvp of week 10. coached a terrible game and my team lost and my qb looked good and he's one step closer to out the door. far from a pos imo
TheKostos,revenge spot tonight for the rockets in utah for that bullshit buzzer beater before the all-star break. houston wins outright. waiting for gordon announcement to bet it but will 100 percent  be on the
TheKostos,getting set to fly back to ny... appreciate everyone that checked out  this weekend with    and me. were back live from the chi on championship sunday and   have it locked down tonight 6-10p et
LockyLockerson,plus  let us  be very realistic the football-sides market with very high limits is extremely tough to beat in almost every case.  your competition is fierce.  medium-to-low limit go5 win totals?  not so much.
LockyLockerson,i'm glad y'all are in on this fiba thing but i am not even close to ready for basketball to be back on my tv.  the raptors won the title like 9 weeks ago.
LockyLockerson,the best part is thinking a team of anthony davis and no one else or durant and no one else is elite.  because the pelicans were totally a title contender for so many years.
LockyLockerson,the show has a lot of really good episodes and really memorable scenes and battles.  but as much credit as they got for that this last couple episodes is a steaming pile of shit.
DannyParkins,"why does the mere mention of his name trigger you so much? capital letters ""obsession"" because of one question at the end of an interview multiple exclamation points... seems like you're the one obsessed."
DannyParkins,i dont think its that bold. i just had donald as clear cut number 1 because its so much rarer and in his case historic to generate that pass rush from an interior lineman.
DannyParkins,ryan pace has now traded up for leonard floyd mitch trubisky eddie jackson anthony miller and david montgomery in addition to pulling off the biggest defensive trade in nfl history for khalil mack. #bears
DannyParkins,kyle hendricks was the only cubs player who made sense to extend and they still had 2 years of control left but youre not gonna find a better professional more deserving of the security.
Gingfacekillah,"breezy. uta strolls to an smooth 16 point mov win over bky easily taking care of the -8 spread. nice cash.

forecasted: uta-12.69 214.58 (u)

result: uta -16 212 (u)"
Gingfacekillah,i hear you lol. i figured if i could beat the nba other sports would be a breeze. its been a long year of tweaks tests and abject failures but making strides every day.
Gingfacekillah,if you remove all the numbers from each selection that have no hit rate you can eliminate thousands of combinations.....and still leave hundreds of thousands of combinations to cover with massively negative ev. lol
logan_matthews9,i dont know getting 2 points on the spread and 2.5 on the total feels like the play here. i originally liked the over but some questionable weather seems to have pushed it down
logan_matthews9,oh i see the possibility. but i dont see much in the past to suggest a p5 school like that even against a really good fcs school should have a line under a  touchdown
logan_matthews9,youre changing my argument. if the discussion is the gold cup should be used to prep for 2022 thats completely different. if its about winning tonight based on the roster bradley has to start
PikachuBets,yeah usually people start to feel bad once the flaw in their argument is exposed and they  daily fantasy sports  want to start backpedaling like they're riding a fixie in the 70s in sf.
PikachuBets,youre right i could be wrong bc i do try very hard to avoid giving you any pageviews. im sorry bby. but lemme know your z-score though once youre done googling for the formula
PikachuBets,you cluelessly tailed a hot streak's hype in a very competitive market got rimmed and are now practically begging for some more plays from your hero. pls correct me where i am wrong ty
PikachuBets,would be absolute criminal if he doesn't get to at least go to summer league for a chance to sign as an ufa somewhere. definitely a bench guard type role possible in the nba

here is my look at all potential matchups and where i anticipate the point spreads opening.

Ccon8181,this has been the case for years. final game of playoffs verse warriors at home last year. 2nd half pulled this effort. worst part in todays professional sports cant bench or tell them anything.
Ccon8181,ive seen it a bunch of times. no such thing as a lock. packers have poor home/road offensive efficiency disparity. that being said giants are decimated by injury. well see how it play out
Ccon8181,its official the #chargers have moved from the browns 2.0 to the new browns.  what the fuck  was that. between coaching incompetence player awareness and just outright awfulness the #lachargers are the new browns
Ccon8181,i told everybody get their accounts funded going into the weekend. 4-1 yesterday 5-1 on the week. and were not done. some really solid sides lined up for today. l field goal !!! #nflsunday
Ccon8181,remind me to not back #osu the rest of the season. yikes. they are atrocious on offense and defense. damn  college basketball  slide continues. gonna be tough bc looking like a big card tomorrow.
Ccon8181,guys ive kept the record on the feed despit it being negative the past 1.5 months. fully transparent. plus i back each wager with my own money. not touting shit just posting the sides...

12Xpert,liquidity has nothing to do with proving whether betting performances are nearly random or otherwise. we are talking about risk-adjusted deviations from expectation (the bookmaker's margin) for example via t scores or z scores.
12Xpert,belonging to the eu might be good for other things like labour rights health and safety and standards and quality of goods but you didn't promote that argument. yours was about trade and tariffs.
12Xpert,but my point still stands. if others do as you you all cancel out. the question is really whether  it is  harder with in-play hence gives more opportunities for clever and/or hard working people.
JambosPicks,the bloomberg sports article references bill miller (legg mason) marvin bush (winston partners) steve duncker (ex-nyra chairman and goldman partner) and david ganek as the people backing this. research referenced was around those individuals.
mschwimer,"actions speak louder than words. my money is on the table. and you just folded like a cheap suit. facts are facts.

but you can always insult me if it makes you feel better!"
mschwimer,i will also say that we could absolutely fall flat on our face. if we do i will look like an idiot and whoever subscribes and doesnt play our recs will look like geniuses.
mschwimer,its one thing for me to say we are the better than anything out there but that is what all the bullshit touts say. im putting my money where my mouth is. will you?
RufusPeabody,in the situation i outlined (team down 14 scores a  touchdown  late in the 4th quarter) going for two is *still* the optimal choice if you assume a rate of 40 percent .
RufusPeabody,the argument that if i had a big bankroll i could make a lot of money sports betting is asinine. being a good sports bettor is how you get to a big bankroll.
RufusPeabody,that is  results from one particular sim of the 20000 sims i run of the rest of the season. so opponent strength is determined by each team's end-of-season mp rating in that sim.
RufusPeabody,"getting picks is not the answer johnson says. picking the right players thats the answer.

however  and  have shown that there's no persistent skill in 'picking the right players' in the nfl draft."
RufusPeabody,i dont think you can say definitively whether or not he has an edge based on parts of two mlb seasons. i had losing mlb season but think i still have an edge.
RufusPeabody,i think the reason i take issue with touts is the same reason i worked as a youth soccer referee and a little league umpire in high school -- i care about fairness.
jeffma,pod should be up in fifteen minutes. sorry for the delay. for those looking for the ma thursday night fade. im on western michigan -4.5 (was -6.5) and miami dolphins +7.5. fade away!
SportsCheetah,its supposed to be a penalty if the ref sees it and deems it so. usually only seen it when its a constant thing during a game and theyve had enough with it.
SportsCheetah,the best part of this outside of the 28 air force points in the 4q and the fashion in which +10.5s lost was how open the other wr was in the end zone
SportsCheetah,i was mad ja rested in their last game too but it was interesting to see regardless that the line moved dallas -3 to as high as -6 once porzingis was announced out.
SportsCheetah,its a continual process as markets and sports evolve but an easy and efficient comparison to make if youre doing your own projections is between yours and the closing lines in the market.

dinkinc,2 plays on the early games....wash under 10-15 and reds under 9 1/2 -10....games will be on the dinkfund page tomorrow /.....   hit me up here if interested...all money goes to the  horses...win-win
dinkinc,no. you should convince your boss that this isnt helpful and is a terrible way to approach handicapping.  youre an excellent handicapper and much better than finding the biggest favorite on the card
robpizzola,ajax 3-2 on aggregate is flattering for juve. they were absolutely trucked over two legs. juve lucky that they capitalized on the only real chances that they had while ajax finishing was poor.
RASPicks,past performance doesn't guarantee future results but we have 20 years of detailed records archived on our website.  we are over 56 percent  last 2000 picks and last 5000 picks with great clv.
VegasRefund,gore had 36 carries on sunday.. a 34 year old coming off a workload like that on a short week.. gore is a workhorse but ill still take my chances given the situation.
ProfessorShine,and nfl touting of sides is ridiculous; the variance is so great and season so small that it could literally take years to figure if your edge isnt simply due to random luck.
ProfessorShine,how can you differentiate that this isnt just noise?   far too many variables to make any conclusions.  at all.   chris seems to tweet these for responses. good marketing but awful for risking cash.
suuma810,"as  reports the #texans are preparing for a potential starting offensive line that ""could feature"" both rookie tackles at guard.

i'm not an ol coach but that doesn't sound like the best idea."
suuma810,he also has 7 ints outside of the cincy game and cannot connect with desean jackson who has a career-low stat line when winston throws him the ball. how does that add up?
suuma810,sean mcvay is awesome. the #packers defense sacked jared goff five times and looked to have the perfect game plan - the #rams still scored 29 points. good breakdown of mcvays in-game adjustments!
ClevTA,he almost got landry killed and almost got miami back in the gm by throwing the ball up 17 with 6m left inside the miami 20. its just dumb. otherwise he was fine
ClevTA,awesome! im sure u were thrilled with that breida injury after 19 snaps on sunday lol. guess that actually is part of the game handicap with him anyways. literally gets hurt every game
CizzlingSports,yeah the thing is they are betting to win $300 so you have to factor in juice. assuming all bets at -110 (they're not; this assumption favors jambos) it would be $168630 risked.
spanky,"ive learned that the european dressmaker invasion is worse than i expected.... 

i hope that the 20s bring about talented bookmakers who bring back honor and prestige to the profession.

happy new year"
spanky,i dont know what proper is but in my world when a bookmaker tells me what their limits are its always the base amount (which is the lower amount of risk and win).
spanky,there is no signup code so i am obviously not earning to anyone playing with either shop. i just tell it like it is.  they are the two best shops on the planet...
spanky,who are the animals?  i firmly believe that if you charge for picks then you probably can't win on your own and need to rely on subscriptions dollars to feed your gambling habit...
spanky,my thoughts are general not just sb specific.  its harder in general to find a price -700 that should be -1600.  its alot easier to find a price +300 that should be +272....
spanky,yeah looking back we were all dummies for believing the hype... the money i did lose was absorbed by royal sportsbook out of curacao which saved face for the industry at the time
spanky,never... before i even place my first bet in any of these casinos i present my id and ask to fill out all tax docs immediately... this way i can start firing uninterrupted....
spanky,i like youre thinking but the problem is there is already testimony of backrooming him saying take the deal or get nothing. thus any attempt at positive publicity will be perceived as disingenuous
DocBettor,the updated black fill for down  distance is good but  it is  the same for the flag indicator now.  that is  the one that should be bright yellow! they'll get it right eventually
PlusEVAnalytics,if you could exit your trades at the closing line without hedging and paying a second dose of vig then you could trade sports without any more variance than youd get trading stocks.
aluckyaday,i guess that would depend if you include decisions to hold. if you have 100 stocks in a portfolio and do a weekly review then over 400 decisions a month would mount up
aluckyaday,but the recreational parlay bettor is not going to win very often. not sure taxing their big wins is going to stop them doing it. they have more of a lottery mindset anyway.
aluckyaday,many uk books still offer the lucky bonuses on horse racing. although they do not promote them as much as they used to! they would much rather you do football accas these days!
aluckyaday,most stats are descriptive not predictive. they tell you what happened in the past not what will happen in the future. inferential statistics are what you should be looking at not descriptive ones...
aluckyaday,if as a society we are going to allow gambling identifying and interacting with those with a problem is the only viable option. driving the problem underground or offshore is not a solution.
aluckyaday,you could do a program on it. the history of measurement. so how was the second defined before caesium was discovered? and the metre before we could accuratly measure the speed of light
aluckyaday,if g is feeling good ineos ride the tourmalet hard. once dqs are down to 2  send bernal on the attack? mas would have to follow isolating alaphilippe. or is that too risky?

joeyisaks,for a guy like you who covers gambling  somehow you dont include in this tweet that this player is managed by a professional gambler and was entered so they could bet against him
EdMillerPoker,seems clear the right idea is to first identify the customers you are targeting the behavior you'd like to encourage and then to design something as fun and newsworthy as possible around that.
EdMillerPoker,ok i figured you were referring to betradar but wanted to make sure. i'm v familiar with these feeds and fairly strongly disagree with you but also kinda want to leave it there.
EdMillerPoker,while the numbers he quotes aren't really very useful for deciding if any particular parlay is a good bet or not i'm not about to try to convince him to start betting parlays
EdMillerPoker,this is a unique poker book you should check out. teaches recreational players to hang in tournaments with the big boys. can't think of anyone better to write a book like that than
EdMillerPoker,holy cow folks thank you. the logic of sports betting is now the #546 best-seller for all books on amazon which is actually ridiculously high.. haven't had a book that high since 2004.
EdMillerPoker,yeah im on an island with him basically everyone likes him so im prob wrong. but im prob gonna have to pass on him the guy rubs me the wrong way ridiculously hard.
EdMillerPoker,most ppl seem to think they can handle the analytics part by hiring a few data science grads which imo is a great strategy to light lots and lots of money on fire
EdMillerPoker,imo  it is  solidly both which is why i thought it was worth sinking so much time into. bc few ppl can give both their due weight and the end result always suffers
GolcondaFund,"lol good luck?
one over under 8.5 win ticket does not compare to the gobs of money we are going to continue to rake in fading this below avg. qb and awful defense."
nonrandomalpha,when the skins released doctson we believed that sent a message that they were more than comfortable with the talent in the receiving corps even if it was apparent to us outsiders yet.
nonrandomalpha,"statistically insignificant. 

i'm not saying the bears won't win (i hope they do!); but they will not blow out the packers like so many delusional fans in here are apparently expecting. get real."
LeeSharpeNFL,"whatever language you are comfortable with and gets the job done is fine  daily fantasy sports  let nerd holy wars stop you from exploring coding.

thank you for coming to my ted talk."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""i was wrong before about the importance of running but like i wasn't really wrong. i look at numbers now. look here's some volume stats which i can plausibly claim back me up."""
LeeSharpeNFL,though wait if this were the case wouldn't you only apply the 1.2x multiplier to the divisional round games where teams are coming off a bye rather than all of the playoff games?
LeeSharpeNFL,obviously coughlin was trying to scoop the bears by trading up to 2 to draft him ahead of the bears at 3  that is  why pace had to beat them to the punch.
LeeSharpeNFL,"right now i'm toying with just valuing fumbles as the ""average"" fumble (as even when the offense recovers  it is  usually some loss in expected points added unless it was a post-catch fumble)."
LeeSharpeNFL,"two weeks in a row where i think arizona should be a home favorite and the market disagrees.

definitely did not work out for me last week though. we'll see about this week."
LeeSharpeNFL,so assuming the seahawks win my model has the bears making the playoffs in 1.8 percent  of simulations but they will only happen if we clap really hard and truly believe in trubisky.
LeeSharpeNFL,the next iteration on the ravens plan imo is not even using a roster slot on a punter. if they really have to punt justin tucker is probably at least okay at it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"ah. use weighted.mean() 

it will take two arguments the first is a vector of your values and the second an equal-length vector of how much to weight each value when calculating the mean."
LeeSharpeNFL,i wasn't breaking it down by field position but a lot of this matches what i was looking at when examining series conversion this past offseason (so this is call pre-2019 data) but:
LeeSharpeNFL,"that would be ideal but tell that to the tv announcers who keep talking about ""which team has the momentum"" as though  it is  predictive for what is likely to happen moving forward."
whale_capper,awesome debate that gets no attention is whether rodgers himself would be better if he had more favre in him... risk aversion over last couple seasons has limited their comeback chances significantly thoughts?
whale_capper,interesting point on buf-dal... would have that highlighted in bright lights as a le touchdown own spot between ne and chi but it is thanksgiving which kinda throws motivational angles out the window
whale_capper,sure but rafa this year is not as strong as years past when theyve gone h2h here... make the match 3-1 nadal but should be more competitive than weve seen in previous finals
AndyMSFW,"waited on some injury news with this one and  it is  still on the sexy side of 3 so i'll be adding to an already bloated weekend card:
cleveland browns -2.5 -105 (5d)"
AndyMSFW,i think a ton of baseball cappers will continue to incorporate wrc+ into their process and  that is  fine.  i like to stay ahead of the curve and will only be using wrc++
AndyMSFW,colgate opened -3 at home on feb 19th when these two teams played and won by 9.  maybe i'm a point or two high but colgate certainly shouldn't be a dog at home
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  but i've gotten this question enough that i went and backtested how they would have done.  still around 60 percent  but actually slightly worse than the full game bets.
JoeyKnish22,lmao 1/4th of the pool is. there was 2 very stale totals so it didnt really take a genius to bet the totals unless you were trying to be contrarian first strategy sake.
JoeyKnish22,you saw this joke in the comments and used it in a qt. thought you were above it. thought you were different. but youve turned into a kardashian stan account for likes. sad.
JoeyKnish22,barrett sallee linking his instagram live videos has to be the worst content in the history of twitter. if you wont ban the nazis or russian bots at least take care of this
JoeyKnish22,one key difference baby. tigers can shoot. duke couldnt became easy to defend in march. and once wiseman is back in the paint . not too late to apologize and get on board.
JoeyKnish22,the lions are trying to do the patriots thing where they trade their good players who are about to get paid except the big flaw is they dont have any other good players.
JoeyKnish22,its an albanian coffee shop. not 100 percent  sure where they get the coffee from but it makes me feel like im gonna have a stroke so i continue to go (probably addicted).
JoeyKnish22,i would love it obviously lol but hes just not putting up the numbers/production you need for an mvp season. would need a huge 2h and some other top contenders to falloff imo.

giants fans should be rooting for the jets and jets fans should be rooting for the giants. any fan of either team that is rooting for their own team is nuts."
TheKostos,dinner at la scarola in chicago. walk past a group of guys in their 20s talking about college basketball betting tonight. chatted for a minute. they were all over it. warms the heart.
LockyLockerson,when i know for sure hamler is playing i'm betting penn state too.  nebraska -5 not even close to around anymore (juiced -6 across the board) so can't really give that out anymore.
LockyLockerson,crazy busy night in the nba...9 games and a ton of injuries.  my full thoughts on every single game now up over at the patreon page!  should be a wild evening of basketball.
LockyLockerson,sp has it like 10-ish so i'm sure it'll go up a little from the opener and because of how stanford looked saturday.  might get a pretty sweet # later in the week.
LockyLockerson,on  and  podcast tonight i'll give out 2 more widely-available win totals (in addition to the 2 i did on  podcast).  which conference would you like to get a win total recommendation from?
EliHershkovich,baylor hung on against butler but big issue for the bears is tristan clark (knee). didn't play tonight and doesn't look healthy after offseason surgery. they're limited offensively without a legit low-post big.
EliHershkovich,"for the first time  we're reacting to meaningful  sweats.

college football week 1 kicks off tonight  we'll have you covered from 6-10 pm est. our win totals cfp futures   before the action begins:"
EliHershkovich,"home run derby odds (via

DannyParkins,dak wentz goff trubisky haskins jones kyler and jameis are all 26 and under nfc starting qbs. if you had to build your team around one of them who ya got and why?
DannyParkins,no im not saying its easier he was incredible. lots of guys wouldnt have risked it. im pointing out just how special he is that it wont effect his money. hes that good.
DannyParkins,when people ask me about  i usually say they havent seen anything yet because hes gonna do such big things but now im not so sure. this is gonna be tough to top.
DannyParkins,getting ready for the final word with    on  at 10pm ct. weve got bulls hawks cubs sox college hoops to get too plus were talking coronavirus! i cant think of anyone more qualified...
DannyParkins,sorry chiefs fans i have a big bet on you guys to win the super bowl at 11:1 from mid season. if youre gonna do this theyll have to overcome my mush powers.
chadmillman,"let us  make this easy. 

call into the radio show with me and bookmaker scooch get all your betting questions answered. 

888 (776-7810)

or listen here.


or watch on: 
 

starting at noon est."
chadmillman,scouting: if vikes make super bowl and they win is this shot of case keenum on sideline a clue about what color gatorade will be dumped? this is the kind of coverage  provides.
Gingfacekillah,showing an edge on uta at -8 slight lean on the under but bky's 3pm variance and tight 1h/1q line suggest it may be less likely. time to fire and watch the market.
Gingfacekillah,when harden and paul combine for 4/18 3pm hou is going to have a bad night. barring a miracle this one is going to lose.  cold shooting for hou has been the story.
Gingfacekillah,from left to right: away win home win draw. looks like the ensemble of models is tracking the line well enough. little bit of value peaking up on the draw (31.11 percent )
logan_matthews9,i would assume they are way easier but frankly i avoid big markets so i cant say for certain. mls openers are generally weak but they adjust quickly because limits are pretty good.
logan_matthews9,sorry but im not sure what basis there is for this. gonzlez was coming off team of the tournament selections for the world cup! maybe you can say inflation and get to $6m?
logan_matthews9,i dont really get the criticism for not calling people like dest paxpo etc in for this. they had the u20 wc to play in and you cant expect them to do both.
logan_matthews9,my understanding is they (or anyone dutch club) wouldnt bring a us player unless they were expected to be on the 18. is that true? also a good sign for those there already.
PikachuBets,2 am lol. i forgot and then tweeted them out too late my bad. also games started at 1430 et which i didnt realize lol bc time zones are hard. #tout101 status lmao
PikachuBets,he sure is free and his name is  so why  daily fantasy sports  you ask him how to get his free plays and see what kind of answer you get? good bye simpleton.
PikachuBets,"""ha rstudio hasn't been slow for me in ages and this shouldn't be a problem anymore"" i said as it slowed down........

edit: it recovered  daily fantasy sports  have to force quit whew"
PikachuBets,correct yes much more work bc if the difficulty with data. manageable but analyzing 14 leagues with over 60 games at my stage of automation is rough. havent had time to finish automation
adamchernoff,"hence the nap part of the equation...

the thing that always intrigues me is that i feel like the way i think about and evaluate nfl teams/markets is applicable to horses. always tempting."
adamchernoff,"i  daily fantasy sports  know about this...

is he trying to say teams can win a football game by not ""setting the tone early"" and trying to ""punch your opponent in the mouth""?"
adamchernoff,"38m matched so far. should top $50m usd. imagine thats near the all time high. 

incredibly not much in comparison to the cricket wc final which is just about to cross $110m usd."
adamchernoff,what else is there to think about in life aside from sports and family to get stressed out about? wife and dog are doing great. golf i watch on tv not so much.
Ccon8181,i dont want to bitch.. i really dont. but the #browns had 7 plays from the 1 yard line and couldnt score. i do t know why im surprised but i am.  #bufvscle
Ccon8181,really like rams 2nd half but not going to die on that hill. they play too conservative dont put teams away. should cover good value but passing. # sunday night football onnbc #phivsla
Ccon8181,of course #falcons get me again! damn bring a blitz once in awhile instead of the prevent d. your defense is sorry cant sit back in prevent. tough l. on to the next
kellyinvegas,information he gives is simply that. its information. you can do whatever you want with it. hes not even doing what i do (still free mind you) and telling people what to bet.

TheCousinSal,cbs will be able to renew for 25k once everyone comes to terms with the fact that the sec is now a poor mans version of the big 12. wheres the great defense?!?!
TheCousinSal,. has just announced that regardless of the final score the nationals will be declared the winners of game 5.  the world series shifts back to houston with the astros down 3-2. sad!
TheCousinSal,you pats fans can blame your defense all you want but try hard not to forget that the jets ran for 169 yards vs. this lions squad a mere 13 days ago. #sundaynightfootball
TheCousinSal,we're auctioning off the scale harry weighed in on for our 52 by 52 challenge issued on against all odds. proceeds go to stoneman douglas victims' fund. i will match the winning bid.
12Xpert,looks like he bets in bigger football leagues so we should expect those to be more efficient. in which case with a large number of subscribers he should be moving lines if skilled.
12Xpert,seems about right. you'd typically expect about three 12s or more in 692 36 percent  bets but none is the most common. here's the probability distribution based on a 10000-run monte carlo simulation.
12Xpert,yes boring. you're obviously missing the point of survivorship bias. only those will the best records get selected to the premium version. but being the best does not imply being the most skilled.
JambosPicks,please click below for the jambos 2019 year-end review which details the reasoning behind our decision to stop selling picks after the super bowl and instead provide our recommendations free to our subscribers.
JambosPicks,we currently have a 17 week package for sale on our site.  starts in october and goes through super bowl. same economics as previous 17 week package.  all information available on our website.
mschwimer,of course not. you can bet none of the games. or pick and choose. you can do whatever you want. refund is based on how our recommendations do. not how you do personally.
mschwimer,i hate the tout indusrty. no way you hate it more than i do. spent years figuring out a way to bring it to its knees. finally have the stuff to do it!
mschwimer,hahahaha. got it. that doesnt look great! but i can guarantee with 100 percent  certainty it is not me. i have never had and will never have a twitter account other than this.
mschwimer,if you actually believed that you would sign up and take our money! but we both know you dont actually believe that. actions speak louder than words! we are giving you 2.3-1 odds!
mschwimer,yes that certainly is!  its 3k per package.  so 50k specifically does not work.  48k or 51k will work!  lets do it!  i will follow you and we can talk on direct message.
mschwimer,all i can do is speak for myself and my record. on all recs i am +18.29units in 176 games. for best bet im doing much worse. +0.69 units in 44 total recs.
RufusPeabody,"what (if anything) does this mean. need to consider the context:
are they taking sharp action?
how much are they letting sharps bet?
are they just copying offshores and moving on air?"
RufusPeabody,it really hinges on how much value the committee puts on winning a p5 conference. and  that is  seemed to vary from year to year. different members on the committee and all.
RufusPeabody,hey  if  is trying to prove  it is  the best at predicting sports why not just track your predictions vs. other data scientists (and the market) and see how they stack up?
RufusPeabody,"how do you feel about rule changes in sports?
(a) love them! they creates more betting opportunities.
(b) hate them! my models have to be  redone and it just creates more work."
RufusPeabody,the address registered to scammer  is also associated with the following: bookie burial vegas domination straight bet system march bookie buster sports information traders total edge system triple play system insiders alliance
RufusPeabody,the success or failure of such a monitor would hinge on its profile. if it became well-known in the industry there would be an expectation that a legit pick-seller would be tracked.
jeffma,im on a plane so worried im getting an alternative feed. aj hinch is really trotting out his mediocre relievers to finish this game? someone please confirm im not watching espn classic
SportsCheetah,more records in the association: golden state's 29-point deficit after the 1q is the largest at home for the warriors in franchise history. also tied for the largest in any game ever.
SportsCheetah,lol no please  daily fantasy sports  we just track everything as the same on the show but i personally bet more on okie state than the jets  for what  it is  worth
SportsCheetah,yeah we bet the wnba heavily before the all-star break. market tightens up quite a bit after that so havent had many significant edges outside of that game 1 total in aces/mystics.
capjack2000,it could. although i think i prefer the mental picture of some overweight guy in baggy clothes busting ass down the boardwalk in mid-july trying to beat the line move at wh.
capjack2000,"great story by  about parlay card hustling. 

good example of how theres the science of beating a casino and then theres the art of getting the money down. 

i miss those days."
capjack2000,"i'm going to live tweet the ""betcast"" on nbc sports philadelphia tonight (mainly for  benefit).

you can ignore this thread if you're not intrigued about how sportsbetting is portrayed in broad media:"
capjack2000,"yawn. these simulated sports horse racing car racing games are d.o.a. everywhere they go. 

people are suspicious enough thinking real sports betting is rigged. they wont play simulated games they know are."
capjack2000,according to what theyve disclosed. they plan to offer promos for betmgm bettors geolocated to their restaurants. so youll get promos that only work when on bww property maybe even comped food/drink.
capjack2000,"as  is fond of saying when asked if modern casinos cheat - ""they  daily fantasy sports  need to they can come up with a scenario where they refuse to pay you.""  4/9"
dinkinc,i was out once when i was eight...they said start counting backwards from 100... i got down to 97 ... strange the stuff you remember... chocolate and vanilla mixed ice cream after
dinkinc,glad you made it.  you have a lot of good people in your life.  likely because its well deserved.  glad you all made it safe and sound .. hugs to the doggos
dinkinc,it is my business when you mentally abuse my friend..... waste of time to block somebody who doesn't follow you in the first place but i will take that as a compliment...
dinkinc,tough answer for me.  prefer nirvana but the foo fighters always use my favorite band the joy formidable as one of their openers so im conflicted some . i like them both
RASPicks,agree in almost all cases but if a service is super successful and becomes a considerable asset there are plenty of reasons why it would make sense to sell in some capacity.
VegasRefund,the numbers dont lie.. which a quick google search will prove but the domino effect from the recency bias creating a false perception is what really hits home for me. the end.
VegasRefund,i couldnt make it through the first episode of action on showtime. theres glimpses of intrigue when theyre featuring bill krackonberger but then it just goes off the rails and becomes unbearable.
ProfessorShine,lthis forum is for opinion and information:  my points are valid.   attack my points.  ive been on here 9  years if i had a hidden agenda you would know it by now.
ProfessorShine,the guy literally sold an idea that a casino that discourages asian bettors non-smokers and no buffets would be great.   hey lets also make people walk all over to find table games.
ProfessorShine,he deletes losers lies about games he gets wrong once used future odds a year old thinks if he gets worst price it is good admits he is a shill.....just all-time awful
suuma810,"before you start handicapping the ne/hou game think about this for a moment:

bill belichick is only a -3 favorite over bill o'brien in a professional football game.

thanks for your attention."
suuma810,"since #bills fans loved to use qbr last year:

tyrod taylor

2015: 66.3 (8th)
2016: 62.4 (9th)
2017: 56.4 (14th)

josh allen

2018: 49.8 (24th)
2019: 37.0 (28th)

but they are 4-1."
suuma810,yep was almost over at 6-2. panthers were one of the biggest candidates for negative seasonal regression so i expected a decline in the second half. but that 0-8 was really crazy.
suuma810,"on first down during the first half:

#colts 14 passes 5 runs 7.6 ypa
#texans 5 passes 8 runs 3.1 ypa

both defenses are good against the run.

halftime score: 17-7 colts."
suuma810,mcvay has consistently used jackson to open up space underneath. even if their connection isn't working i'm curious how much jackson works as a decoy when winston is targeting the other guys.
suuma810,"#seahawks on first down through week two:

27 passes 7.2 yards per play
24 runs 3.4 yards per play

i guess pete  brian will be working all week on establishing the run."

#nfl #betting"
ClevTA,correct. thats always #1. running out of spread formation is #2. i was just saying its not some cute play freddie made up the rams and many others run that same play
ClevTA,he has an awful and injured ol vs a top 3 pass rush. he wont have time to move it. and hodges is an unknown so should be low scoring type gm

CizzlingSports,"personal taek is that knowingly selling losing picks is fraud even if your website has that silly ""for entertainment purposes only"" fine print particularly where your tag line is ""get rich kids"""
CizzlingSports,the affiliate fee mission statement which to my knowledge the current ceo has not rescinded or repudiated should change your mind about millman's character. all of this is likely above schwartz's head.

spanky,honored to be recognized as a flag bearer by  to try and help influence the future of bookmaking in nj and america.. without him regulated bookmaking in nj would have never existed....
spanky,i can say with 100 percent  certainty that not only is  the real deal but the international group he deals with (who are personal friends of mine) is the real deal!  respect
spanky,knows his shit. way smarter than i can ever dream of being. but the most credible attribute he has is he actually bets unlike 99.9 percent  of the math nerds on twitter.

PlusEVAnalytics,at a snoopy vs the red baron kids theme park ride. i hope these 5 year olds know their 80s comic strips and their world war 1 history to truly appreciate this.
PlusEVAnalytics,re xfl: if books offer significant limits (big if) first few weeks could be opportunities for sharps who do their homework. the power of adverse selection intensifies in a chaotic environment. #antifragile
aluckyaday,it does. my luckies have an expected return of 22 percent  based on bfsp. just learnt not to count my chickens at 11am! seen all blue turn to red too many times
aluckyaday,simplicity i guess. using joseph's data table trick takes a couple of minutes at most. i think it would take me longer to code it and i have a computer science degree!
aluckyaday,just a thought what happens to the fav/long bias if you stake for level win rather than level stake. does it become more of a straight line rather than an exponential one?
aluckyaday,yep. the fact that he says he is doing it because he hates bookmakers brings everything he is saying in to question. i doubt very much he could make 1m from softs!
aluckyaday,another way to evaluate a record which requires less data is to use the closing line but you need to record that at the time or find a site that has it.
aluckyaday,i have no information on how they really work just reading between the lines from what marco and their traders have said in various podcasts/twitter chats. my theories might be complete bs.
joeytunes2,just more guys that dont have balls. they just wanna go after winners. its saturday he's making fake accounts.he should be pleasing his boyfriend!. dont fade me book me! but ty bucka
joeytunes2,hedging seems smart and less risk. smart guy once told me. if you never hedged your whole life you would be up more that way. your also betting into 2 juiced numbers.
joeyisaks,also 2:03 timeout means they basiclaly have an untimed play cause 2 minutes warning guarantee stop clock so they can throw or run . if they waited cowboys woulda ran twice ..
EdMillerPoker,not quite right to say i learned this the hard way but kinda. never the right idea to look at something see the fatal long term flaw and just start fading it.
EdMillerPoker,yes it treats a free kick after a safety differently than a kickoff when we make all the lines. we just didnt code the website to display the words receiving free kick
EdMillerPoker,they  daily fantasy sports  have much option this season except to take their hits imo. they want to offer the product and  it is  still all about customer acquisition and market expansion.
EdMillerPoker,they have imo v impressive market share in nj non- daily fantasy sports  division and they lead in nv. i think they do some important things well product-wise and thats basically why.
EdMillerPoker,im optimistic too i can tell ppl are working hard on apol1-assoc disease therapies. thanks for posting all those biopsies if you post enough ill learn how to read them eventually. :)
EdMillerPoker,the wealthy pro-tax folks generally feel like a few extra marginal dollars offers them minimal utility and for that they think theyre buying social stability and more various and diverse government services.
EdMillerPoker,really what you are looking for are logical inconsistencies from one price to the next. a model just makes these pop and also helps you to find the smaller ~2 percent  ones.
EdMillerPoker,why not say theres some customers we simply cant beat and for those we have to limit the damage. we are working every day to better serve all our customers including these.
EdMillerPoker,"step 5. draw upon classical virtues such as strength dignity wisdom virility courage health and so on and weave a hybrid narrative that melds your chosen ""owned"" concept with your chosen virtues."
LeeSharpeNFL,we  daily fantasy sports  have enough draft capital to pick a new qb. i assume trubisky is the starter for 2020 as much as i would prefer a trade of some kind.
LeeSharpeNFL,"my preseason projection for the vikings:

min
avg wins: 8.
playoffs: 45 percent 
win division: 31 percent 
have bye: 14 percent 
homefield: 6 percent 
win nfccg: 7 percent

#1 (end of day)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"the wpa of the david montgomery  touchdown is showing at +40 percent  wpa for the lions. 

so not publishing the chart as that makes no sense. may try processing it again later."
LeeSharpeNFL,the whole thing is dumb. sucks when opi/dpi is called wrong in either direction but  it is  gonna happen. subjecting it to replay just seems absurd especially when nobody understands the standard.
whale_capper,deep dive perspective from a professional gambler... we have a fascinating conversation with  that covers the state of the industry player advocacy and what to do once you identify your edge. enjoy!
whale_capper,all the respect in the world to best of luck for putting live draft props up... would love to know what the overall damage was on nyg take an offensive player though
AndyMSFW,just because there is a standalone nfl game tomorrow morning does not mean you have to bet it.  (unless you have a stone-cold lock... in that case slide into my dms) #nfluk

JoeyKnish22,"sprinkled a few long doggy turkey day nfl specials from  ($500 max win):

most rushing yards: bo scarborough +700 

most passing yards: josh allen +1700 

most receiving yards: gallup +2000 robinson +2500"
JoeyKnish22,ill never be able to prove this. but im 80 percent  sure holgerson was mixing meth with bourbon regularly when he was at west virginia. and houston is suffering the after effects.
JoeyKnish22,doubled down with some toronto fc +0.5 (-107) tonight cause anytime you can make a loss twice as painful by losing against the spread and futures you really have to do it.
JoeyKnish22,if michigan can run the ball they could run it up a bit. but shea patterson is not playing well enough to cover 4 scores vs anybody with even a remote pulse.
JoeyKnish22,i actually dont believe he does per some michigan ppl id list him more as very questionable/doubtful. but the starting lt runyan should be back and theyre more than stocked at wr.
TheKostos,i  daily fantasy sports  wanna hear the carson wentz defenders right now. yes his ol is banged up and his receivers stink but he is playing poorly regardless of all of it

LockyLockerson,also in no world do i think michigan is better than ohio state. or that theyd win or be favored.  just in terms of who else these wisconsin results help clearly michigan.

Gingfacekillah,less efficiency in nfl pointspread markets than nba markets. my thinking is that this is due to the increased randomness/ decreased certainty of football.  240 games in this sample se of 12.87.
logan_matthews9,thats way more work than i care to do for a process i completely half ass at the moment. the gains to be made my making this more complicated is relatively unimportant
logan_matthews9,how does somebody do this? if ive got the model and edge but not the resources it seems easy to partner with a large bankroll/resource center as a win win for everyone
logan_matthews9,literally none of what you posted were facts. i have no dog in this fight you just seemed upset that philly got screwed in the fultz trade so i offered a hug
PikachuBets,finding out that there are 21 fcs week 1 games on a thu when its 10pm the night before and your code isnt even done is the definition of not great bob
PikachuBets,are you saying you want a book that offers these or that the lines are no longer available? all of these are still valid. i  daily fantasy sports  tweet stale lines ever.
PikachuBets,everyone knows #toutinainteasy....but maybe its much easier than wed thought?? especially if this is the kind of customer that you attract. $500 sub is nothing if i just bet $50!! dead lol.
PikachuBets,trends will never work. zero predictive value. telling people all they need to do is work hard and find a trend is inane. the fact that you think otherwise reveals your cluelessness
PikachuBets,"international baskets #globalball

adamchernoff,one of the most respected leaders within any nfl locker room. he has had immediate buy-in everywhere from the staff and players. awesome playbook solid track record and results everywhere he goes.
adamchernoff,well im the least intelligent person on that list by a mile - but thanks for the nod. those guys can play the tips and ill keep swinging away from the whites.
adamchernoff,the model pulls team hits for (season) starting pitcher hits allowed (career) and bullpen hits allows (season) data each night. a normal distribution projects probability for exact hits from 0-30 for each.

Ccon8181,the go ahead touchdown called back for #texas .. #msu in full collapse mode after taking big halftime lead. it happens but tcu texas now msu.. gotta stay away from sharp objects
Ccon8181,heres another bet on it.. you see that line come from +3 to +2.5??? got a lot more but cant show all my tickets. on it moneyline as well worst price +125
Ccon8181,#nebraska couldnt make a shot until the game was out of reach. made a fake comeback. needed that effort earlier when it mattered. that was a tough l. on to the next
Ccon8181,unpopular opinion: dont vote! unless you have a basic understanding of economics and the impact financially of the outcomes of each option... too many ppl lacking common sense are encouraged to vote.
kellyinvegas,doesnt look like i can get the flights to work out for the  also the line move in the game.  what the fuck . i dont want to go watch them lose
ToddFuhrman,there have been a lot of reasons to criticize baker all season for on field performance and off field antics but this post game interview shows poise and maturity of a leader
TheCousinSal,can we do away with this football move horseshit?  no one including the refs understands it and it really isnt essential to possession when the receiver is taking full steps with control.
TheCousinSal,on an all-new nba futures podcast edition of against all odds -  gushes over his mvp vote + roy sleepers and the trifecta tackles over/under win totals division and title odds. #gambling
TheCousinSal,"move over jeopardy james.  has cashed in on 16 consecutive womens softball games. hes going to kill me for jinxing him but tonight he likes....

ucla +1.5 over oklahoma (-150)
#againstallodds #lockitin"
TheCousinSal,people are bummed that there havent been many upsets in the tourney this year. id actually trade a weekend of crappy games for a more competitive sweet 16 with stronger teams. #sorryanteaters
TheCousinSal,feel for you buddy. i keep waiting for the celtics to get that one break that sends boston sports in a positive direction. just doesnt seem like its ever going to happen.
TheCousinSal,gst +1.5 makes it 4 best bets in a row on given out on #againstallodds.  also this shit is totally legal now. winner number 5 released on the podcast tomorrow night.  #gambling
TheCousinSal,a brand new against all odds podcast is up. this week i get a teaser tuneup from sports gambling guru  + real props fake props and best bets with my degenerate trifecta.
TheCousinSal,ravens are -9.5 for the second half on  i think they pull out a close one. and as you know i am red hot today - having won one in a row.
12Xpert,"just wondering if you understand pareto principle rob.
also wondering what peer-reviewed source has been used to imply that high-spending vips are disproportionately more like to be addicts. can you quote one?"
12Xpert,that is  a different story and an different argument. it has a lot of merit but i  daily fantasy sports  think it is served too well by joining it with this one.
12Xpert,i'd still expect the largest profits to be coming from the 2 percent  commission because these account for circa 80 percent  of bets and probably in excess of 95 percent  of volume.
12Xpert,or it might be that we've impacted such a change that the current cycle of glacial/interglacial periodicity (last 2 million years or so) will be completely disrupted and we'll have something new.
12Xpert,then he would know that single results or small profits from 194 bets in a mostly random environments prove nothing at all. in which case why say its only profit that matters?
12Xpert,bookmakers compute their odds algorithmicly. it will be pretty efficient on average i expect unless there is some sort of in running bias that punters exhibit and they are happy to exploit
12Xpert,for nish closing prices are on average about 3 percent  shorter than his advertised prices so currently in his case you will still be showing a 6 percent  roi before subscription costs.
12Xpert,bet365 opening odds versus  not as good as  using the method inspired by  538 contributes about 16.5 percent  of the signal relative to bet365. against pinnacle it was just 4 percent .
mschwimer,yes. but then we get lumped into the people i hate. touts. dont want to go 4-8 in a week then say this pick is 10 units and claim a winning week.
mschwimer,never said that. you can do all the research you want on our line movement. all our plays are free for everyone to see. they are time stamped so anyone can verify.
mschwimer,you and me both. porcello was lights out. big swing and a miss in that game. if the rangers hold then  will be 3-2 on the day! will always take 60 percent
mschwimer,y are people saying this is a great draft for the 76ers? they lost 23 year old point guard who will be a top 5 pg in the league for 7 years.
RufusPeabody,there's a reason simplebet has pivoted from their original business model of pricing outcomes with ml. and  it is  not because of a shortage of machine learning people in their employ.
RufusPeabody,i probably was on the same side of them on same games and the opposite on others. i have no idea how i did when i agreed or disagreed with them.
RufusPeabody,i think the nonprofit angle could have legs. plenty of people would be willing to donate plus there's government grants -- this is providing a service that benefits consumers after all.
RufusPeabody,so give me some numbers. base rate is ~47-48 percent . what's the probability of converting 2-pt convo if they for 2 after the first  touchdown  vs. waiting till the third?
jeffma,im not saying they should have made the playoff but the notion that they cant play with sec teams based on an 8 point loss without their starting qb seems rash
jeffma,for the record i didnt take a shot at the smell test. i thought  was there so i was asking him if that was a smell test game. was legitimately curious
SportsCheetah,nah nothing else outside the podcast i just posted a bit earlier. always happy to share my thoughts on games youre looking at feel free to shoot me a message whenever.
SportsCheetah,utah made so many mistakes that will probably get discussed more than how damn good herbert was in that first half. best half he had played since usc 5 weeks ago.
SportsCheetah,i just had pinny up. -1700 up 24 seemed low and it was -2900 something by the time i checked and went back to screen after about 20 seconds or so.
SportsCheetah,"a conversation i just had with myself: 

the rams are losing on sunday

but they lost to danny dimes

danny is the next gardner minshew

touch i'll take the 10 points"
capjack2000,this guys head will explode when he realizes in the future youll play those same slots on your smartphone from your home and smartphone companies will look to become casino operators.
capjack2000,"not sure how i feel about this.  it is  gimmicky but on the other hand the inaugural class is strong:
charles mcneil bob martin lefty jimmythegreek  bw.  

treat this with respect"
capjack2000,"i see value in it. you get to see who is checking out your content and there is a much higher signal-to-noise ratio than twitter. 

although truth-to-signal ratio might be low."
capjack2000,"and here's how pa will look broken down by actual sportsbook vendor (and this assumes willhill holds onto either hollywood or harrahs following the czr/eri merger). 

not so competitive now eh?"
capjack2000,"""thescore remains on schedule for its anticipated state-wide launch""

now if only they'd let us know that schedule. still no apps in app stores and the website still says coming soon."
capjack2000,you follow me. i dont follow you. however plenty of people i respect get drawn into your half-baked rumor posts so i see them often. you can do better than this.
capjack2000,i have to take issue with comparing this to card counting or phil iveys edge sorting. thwarting geolocation is a direct violation of regulations. whereas the other two activities are not.
capjack2000,they donated to the fund started by future gov sisolak so i see your skepticism. the point though is that tribal casinos arent any more or less compassionate than commercial casinos.
dinkinc,your mess ups did not involve abuse of animals or attempts to seriously injure people. he was an uncaring dick off the track as well. not everyone deserves a second chance.
dinkinc,have been ring announcers... i have an idea for a baldwin park show in my little brain that would be very cool.... plenty of youtubes for you to look at emily...
dinkinc,stfu already... even your most loyal supporters  daily fantasy sports  want to hear how great you think you are...  inviting terrorists to dinner seemed like a good idea to you huh
dinkinc,me too.... i can't believe how bad trubisky was.... i wonder if that was a one game bad performance or he always throws to his receivers when they are totally covered
dinkinc,right before the end of the notre dame game espn put up the louisville schedule and the color man said they might win six games.  he was fired on the spot
dinkinc,some very smart people dont realize others simply cannot do what they do ... cannot think like they think.. what comes easy to them is very difficult to the vast majority
dinkinc,i will figure out a way to keep in touch with my real friends like you and jojo ... not going to lose those people.  just wont be posting much .
dinkinc,the jackpot carryover likely keeps santa anita open for the last 2 weeks.  another thought if racing ends what happens to all the horses that you are trying to protect ?
dinkinc,gambling is about value and not blindly picking winners.  you must compare a horses chances to his odds. you can have a plan but you cant know who you are betting..
dinkinc,he bets high. pays and wins.... he does much more than that... he is very generous to those who help him make money... we all do networking to make ourselves better...
robpizzola,the overtime streak is finally snapped. thank you florida panthers. i think  was worried that i was going to snap his 25-consecutive ot/so losses record... i made it over halfway there!
robpizzola,that double lead actually isn't as hard as i thought on the recording. would still take some serious work but  it is  doable. most of their stuff is confirmed not doable.
robpizzola,yes. funny enough beat closing line in 15 of those 16 games. five of them went to overtime or so and lost all five. just an insane run of bad variance.
robpizzola,the sample is so small that its irrelevant regardless. 15 playoff series each year extreme amount of luck involved. websant had the best playoff predictions last season for crying out loud.
robpizzola,if anything since the vast majority of people are blindly taking 12 seeds now and have been for some time you can differentiate yourself by having the 5 seeds advance further.
VegasRefund,i dont care if youre a player getting paid $1 million or $100 million.. imagine putting $32 million dollars on the line at the hands of the media voting for you.
VegasRefund,i really dont do this often since im not the biggest fan of paying for plays hence im free... but there are a handful honestly worth it..  being one of them.
VegasRefund,find out the bc game gets cancelled while im standing in line at a gas station.. so i decide to throw a dart at a scratch ticket. law of averages ftw.
ProfessorShine,her career to this point was about selling picks not to get better at betting. she currently works for grifters at wagertalk promoting their salesmen who are as bad as vd.
suuma810,"since the #seahawks drafted russell wilson in 2012 they have only lost three games by more than 10 points. out of 116.

they are +10 dogs against the #rams this week."
suuma810,cody kessler might not be a playmaker but he should provide much better ball security than blake bortles does. bortles now has 47 fumbles  72 ints in 71 career games. #jaguars
suuma810,"we took the dolphins +3 +100 right after the opener. early sell high on the jets with an inflated line off their monday night football  blowout win.

here is the write-up:"
suuma810,played giants +3 play on defense and fade of jags offense on the road. without the big barkley run  tipped pick-six still a 5-point game. nyg needed some dpis to score.
suuma810,gameday! aside of detailed analysis we are approaching week one with 6 picks on sunday and monday. wanna jump on board? sign up  find all the picks in the members area:
ClevTA,true. in one score situations with brissett they go 51 percent  pass 5th lowest in the nfl. i just thought last night's 39 percent  was a much more of an outlier
ClevTA,u are focused on the wrong thing. in one score game situations the browns have run it the 6th least in the nfl. should be closer to middle of the pack
ClevTA,rb angle route! love it. i have no idea why colleges dont use rbs in pass gm more. its a major inefficiency along with te usage in college football right now
ClevTA,i dont listen or read any  daily fantasy sports  touts so i have no idea. i use my own matchup data. i also had steelers d which was 2 percent  owned
CizzlingSports,"wow  blocks ppl who track him accurately whodathunkit

also that link obv doesn't negate that he mass-released sea -7 but nothing ever matters anyway when u only bet monopoly money so"
CizzlingSports,"imagine not injecting some hurting part of you are lyfe into every sprots story i bet there's ppl out there who can actually avoid doing this

# worst of all time"
spanky,"for us its college hoops. way too many games for bookmaker to keep up with. 

props are also very beatable in most sports as bookmakers put those up as a concession."
spanky,i dont operate in any shadows. every government agency is well aware of who i am and what i do. every major bookmaker knows who i am.  thanks for your interest.
spanky,i'm considering popping into vegas for a few days during the tournament. i keep hearing great things about the d and   its been way too long.  i need to head downtown!
PlusEVAnalytics,"minassian was drawn into conversation through patient and clever questioning by det. rob thomas an investigator with toronto polices sex crimes behavioural assessment section.

so would you say the detective was.......smooth?"
PlusEVAnalytics,so my transaction sits in scheduled status for who knows how many hours during which the price of bitcoin can fluctuate wildly? tell me again why this system is so great?
PlusEVAnalytics,there are a lot of interesting opportunities here but also a lot of work. might be a collab opportunity if you or anyone else wants to work on it with me..
PlusEVAnalytics,the leader of the free world is vain as fuck and uses the dow jones to measure his dick. virus or no virus thats gotta be a pretty good bull signal?
aluckyaday,so are you! i've just not seen anything to convince me this liquidity is suddenly going to appear. where are you going to get the consistent losers to finance this from?
aluckyaday,if you split a single tipsters record in 2 and there is correlation between the 2 halves does that imply skill? or could it just be they have been consistently lucky?
aluckyaday,if you have any evidence of a bookmaker actively marketing to customers they have identified as being at high risk of addiction i suggest you send it to the gambling commission.
aluckyaday,i take the consensus handicap (the one with the most quotes) and if i want an actual price rather than a standard margin i use pinnys last price at that handicap.
aluckyaday,ok. so maybe the client model weights new accounts as very sharp until they know otherwise that would make sense if as you say syndicates are doing it to manipulate prices.

joeytunes2,check back in 3 hours. lets face it its what the committee wants. whats better for the ratinga? lsu playing in the championship is good for ratings. especially having the heisman
joeytunes2,lol! ok contest us on the table or i'll pay 69 percent  at least make it real.. funny nobody knows u on the circuit.  that is  where is real guys are.
joeyisaks,i will be guest on  podcast today topics include getting kicked off pph bookies sites/ getting stiffed stories and other random stuff that goes on. any questions tweet one of us
EdMillerPoker,that book was designed to just give an oversimplified intuitive explanation to traditional live players of the new way of thinking/playing. 70 percent  was never a magic number in any way.
EdMillerPoker,man of the year  took a break from laying waste to all who come before him to read and praise our new book the logic of sports betting! thanks james.  #jeopardyjames
EdMillerPoker,thank you very much. the new book likely we will make an audiobook. the poker books i havent for various reasons that have to do with the business side of things.
EdMillerPoker,the good thing about accuracy (and latency) is that its 100 percent  measurable. any demand to buy official data should come with strict benchmarks that the data must meet to qualify.
EdMillerPoker,broadly agree but dont overstate the case. like pretty much any gambling its not hard to win small-time money sports betting but gets increasingly harder the more you want to make.
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i think its not entirely unlikely for amazon to get involved not imminently but in a few years and if they did it would be.. disruptive
LeeSharpeNFL,"conversation from our sports betting slack:

me: ok i'm remodeling with mccarron.

 which is more likely in 2023 he's still in the nfl or hosting a tlc show with that name?"
LeeSharpeNFL,a goos question. could be packers play in a way that invites more penalties. could be officiating bias (more likely to protect known qbs). could be other factors or a combination.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i can't fault this too much.

people have several years of mediocre cousins to look back on and so are skeptical that he's great now.

while mahomes/jackson have ""only"" been good."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think you're missing the ""that this would show up in their on-field production"" part of the question e.g. that the magnitude of any effect of this is distinguishable from variance."
LeeSharpeNFL,"if you had told me 2 years ago this is what would be said 2 years for now it would have filled me with glee.

now...  it is  a little terrifying."
LeeSharpeNFL,this is a high enough leverage o'brien challenge that this late in the game it makes sense to me even though i think the odds he wins it are quite low.
LeeSharpeNFL,i realize oak had 4th and 17 but they were at the kc 26 and down 21 points. kicking a field goal is not gonna put them back into this game.
LeeSharpeNFL,"all 8 visiting teams started with the ball in the morning games?  that is  pretty random.

what's next all 8 home teams start with the ball in the second halves? #illuminati"
whale_capper,if it doesnt follow a predictable arc that can generate a couple hundred articles so they can collect a few years salary then what good is it as a sports story?
whale_capper,good time of the season to take a crack at this the service point hold probabilities are a lot more stable for grass and the us hard court swing than clay
AndyMSFW,along with seattle any which way you can i played the overs in foxboro and the superdome.  made both numbers higher when we talked earlier and won't be changing my mind.
AndyMSFW,"food $200

JoeyKnish22,btw if anybodys looking to sell pickz on the gram i have been hitting the gym lately squat rack 2x . dms are open im probably a bit cheaper than lindsay.
JoeyKnish22,folks....the lions might be playing a mall santa on qb this thanksgiving....and theres still -2.5s to be had. go ahead and buy extra lb turkey cause its a get paid holiday
JoeyKnish22,was informed and confirmed this morning  corrected this and graded the props a winner. good on them for making it right and thanks to those who assisted in getting it fixed.
JoeyKnish22,stafford playing the best football of his career. its a shame lions team isnt a bit better (and coaching and organization in general werent complete trash). but hes dealing this year.
JoeyKnish22,my favorite color guy is ahmad brooks and its because he talks kinna ghetto like a lot of players actually would and you just cant find that authenticity on most games.
JoeyKnish22,its beyond absurd they havent made him available which seems like its just out of spite?? especially after what the fins got for tunsil they should be holding a bidding war.
JoeyKnish22,same company gdax just rebranded to coinbase pro so this is in reference their fees. i believe the retail traditional coinbase is actually even worse regarding fees for purchase and sale.
JoeyKnish22,if you bet one or both of these goys with me preseason (where number went against us for various reasons) can get off now live for a middle if ya like.
JoeyKnish22,im here for it. little wager who wins more games this year michigan or lsu? i mean ill feel bad for ya when lsu goes 6-6 but ya asked for it.
JoeyKnish22,oh hmmmm i see no mention of the new offensive system new oc (doesnt even mention his name) or complete philosophy shift on offense. found a good spot for that article.
TheKostos,the farther football season gets in the rear view mirror the better basketball is getting. not gonna lie it feels good after getting my ass kicked for most of the fall
TheKostos,i was also hoping for the punt but i think conchairto was even better with the way they built to it with the teased chair shots and how edge sold it
TheKostos,the beluga 1.0s are a 10 the others are 10.5. my true size is 10 but i usually go up a half size for 350s but the belugas fit me great
TheKostos,it has literally been an hour. can i get someone to call me back? i cannot be sitting on the phone for this long i have stuff i have to do
LockyLockerson,we might be at the point with the wizards that they should just station a couple players at the opposite end to cherry pick instead of playing 5-man defense.  no difference.
LockyLockerson,as someone who had both the jets and the lions yesterday a friendly reminder that almost all of us shouldn't be betting into nfl markets with the idea of long-term profit.
LockyLockerson,this was pretty epic.  we just finished recording and i have very little voice left.  there is a lot of info.  hopefully everyone enjoys it or gets something out of it.
LockyLockerson,getting to the point where i cant even read all the stories every day.  they wont necessarily win you any money but still great coverage of awesome stories in the sport.
LockyLockerson,i will say without good nfl projections to make exact prices just in general a lot of the nfl sides look appealing.  niners jags +1 even green bay at plus money
LockyLockerson,fun update: cincy now all the way to 6.5 still taking tiny bets by the bucketload.  at 7 is where i'd stop but let see where everyone else's head is at.
LockyLockerson,bahahaha the shut up this is the greatest show in history folks have showed up.  i mean i may not laugh harder this year.  twitter.  oh man its the best sometimes.
LockyLockerson,"easy to say ""huh?!"" or ""who?!?"" or ""why not matt rhule?"" but i think at the very least if you're a giants fan you're ecstatic  it is  just not jason garrett."
EliHershkovich,"for sure but they're not ""elite"" defensively. beyond this one their only other road game was at unc against a team that can't shoot and anthony who's struggled to finish inside."
DannyParkins,im well aware it was a projection. i have no clue. i thought the change of batting stance and numbers pre and post change was noteworthy for a 24 year old.
DannyParkins,since ive been on in afternoons its basically impossible for me to make it to  but a day game in colorado makes it possible. today at 6:00 im comin in hot.
DannyParkins,well there's also the child with the broken arm. also the nfl suspended jimmy smith for making threats and being emotionally abusive. again you're totally comfortable saying he did nothing wrong?
DannyParkins,i'll save my thoughts on losing 2 of 3 to the rangers while scoring 28 runs the cubs bullpen darvish moncada giolito and the opening weekend of chicago baseball for 2pm
DannyParkins,no clue? hes been awesome in commercials his peyton places show on espn+ as espys host and on frickin snl! it strikes me as very unlikely hed be anything but great.

logan_matthews9,tyler boyd literally played for another country and then picked the us... one month ago. theres so many other examples and they vastly outnumber the players who didnt pick the us
logan_matthews9,did i say they werent? the idea that ussf isnt doing enough for dual nationals is ludicrous- its literally the one thing that theyve done consistently well over the past decade
PikachuBets,bro you need to calm down with the tagging orgy every single week. he's a loser we get it. you got ripped off sucks. can you stop tagging me now thanks
PikachuBets,using what coefficient? the standard 0.44? you cant compare ts percent  from 1991 2002 and 2019 without adjusting those coefficients to reflect the monstrous modern increase in 3 field goal  shots
PikachuBets,whats the over under on how many dms  is gonna get from degens asking to get onto floyds book?? david make sure to ask for a sizeable free play referral bonus
PikachuBets,he rode berrys dick with some joint newsletter thing they did and afaik thats how he got his big twitter following. i wasnt around then though so this is secondhand info
PikachuBets,-180 can have value. -300 can have value. however unlikely  it is  possible. gotta have more than the odds to know if  it is  +ev and thus if  it is  positive...
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  know the origin story of why it ended up there but do you know if they had an option to build new or put it else where?
adamchernoff,same guy that answered we want guys that love football because guys that love football make coaching easy to a reporter asking what he saw in depth players after week one.
adamchernoff,agree 100 percent . anything over 5 hours and i travel with an emergency footlong from subway just in case a few too many become available at top good a price.

Ccon8181,#nfl comes up with more bullshit rules as they go every week. #rams getting the ball to start game and after half??!! gtfo how do i bet on this league. #larvsdal
Ccon8181,i know. but they had exposure to the over plus it keeps them from getting middled on the spread. but i 2nd your tweet big money exposure on pack to cover.
kellyinvegas,that was great info. big money came in at 7. had multiple chances to cover that game. dont be that guy. just be happy to cash a ticket against the rlm
kellyinvegas,but on the road is a different story. im not betting the lions. just not rushing to back the cowboys in another road situation where they should easily win/cover but dont.
ToddFuhrman,no doubt need to get the running game on track to be successful in the post season; lets see the kind of contributions they can get from a healthier damian williams
ToddFuhrman,everyone wants a piece of the growing sports gambling world but i'm just not sure everyone knows what it takes for an operator to actually turn a profit in the space
ToddFuhrman,daily fantasy sports  let the secret out...or share the fact their toughest opponent to date as far as ypg offense is ole miss at 57th in the country vs fbs opponents
ToddFuhrman,i love that the cleveland browns cant stop talking this entire offseason; as if the target wasnt already big enough on their backs theyll undoubtedly get every teams best shot now
ToddFuhrman,we have one; called  every day where i try and work to be the rightful king and  lives in a fantasy land thinking he can ultimately sit on our iron throne
TheCousinSal,on an all-new against all odds the degenerate trifecta  i handicap nba game 3 nhl game 5 we break down joshua/ruiz sharptank +  calls in to promote his amazing new documentary.
TheCousinSal,on an all-new #againstallodds the degenerate trifecta  i review our losing super bore props preview 2020 nfl odds +westgates  on how vegas made out. spoiler: theyre going to be just fine
12Xpert,bookmakers unfortunately are not charities so  daily fantasy sports  have to fund your activity if they  daily fantasy sports  want to. it may seem annoying but  that is  how it is.
12Xpert,have you counted them? have you counted the ones that aren't solid? can you even see them? do they all reveal themselves to you? you just make suppositions no actual evidence.
12Xpert,assuming your expectation was a loss equivalent to the bookmaker's margin for those odds (about -3 percent ) then a monte carlo simulation showed this probability was about 6 percent .
12Xpert,var is pointless if referees wont look at the video evidence and junior officials wont overturn decisions. premier league has got it all wrong. a foul is a foul. the end.
12Xpert,"i might also add that if it we were talking about ""55 percent  of who were black transgender women jewish etc) you would rightly be called out. why not over ageism?"
12Xpert,i've scaled the blind betting stakes in the graph by a factor of 21915/(3*18105) so i can make a fair visual comparison. difference is not statistically significant but still.... oh dear.
JambosPicks,"first week of paid packages complete! results with $ if subscribers bet recommended amount ($300) 

59 recs. +8.49u (+$2547)
mlb: 37 recs. +6.37u (+$1911)
 college football : 22 recs. +2.12u (+$636)"
JambosPicks,we are working on a solution that will answer the majority of these questions about the security of the guarantee. hope to have something tomorrow but could be later than that.
mschwimer,its been 48 straight hours for me in twitter. i will not stop until we have a system that cant be picked a part from a transparency or financial accountability way!
mschwimer,if the eagles use mccoy more in the passing game they will win... in 4 out of the 6 games he has caught less than 4 passes... this is a joke
RufusPeabody,also you really need to break down by type. added games should not really be considered since limits are $500/$250 at cris (and  daily fantasy sports  they recommend $300/bet hmm)
RufusPeabody,i said that he asked me to evaluate the importance of different metrics in his ratings for  college basketball  and they came out really close to what he was using
RufusPeabody,here's what i make the wgc-fedex st jude's win odds after 3 rounds: rory +145 koepka +295 rahm +964 fitzpatrick +1093 leishman 24/1 noren 37/1 horschel  thomas 64/1 fleetwood 75/1
RufusPeabody,i disagree with this. if im regressing properly to the market and lets say accounting for mkt getting more efficient as long as youre not overstating your edges youre fine
RufusPeabody,these are +ev lottery tickets erik. having a 750/1 shot at even par isn't so bad -- i make morikawa +2037 true price for t10 right now and ortiz 21/1.
RufusPeabody,i dont know what that is but it seems to me that you could have two shots from the same xy coordinates that have very different xg. am i wrong?
RufusPeabody,that is  not the argument he's making. simply being more gullible or exhibiting more irrational biases will not lead you to hit 45 percent . markets are not that inefficient.
jeffma,i understand what you are saying but you are more sophisticated than most bettors. if the pick sellers market themselves with the nuance that you are describing god bless them
jeffma,"i agree with him that you have to shake these off but ""while the wound is still fresh"" you are allowed to bitch and moan as loud as you want"
SportsCheetah,i saw this the other day something like in the past 17 seasons only two true freshman have done 400+ points 80+ blocks and 50+ assists: queta and anthony davis.
SportsCheetah,i could have bad info its happened before (although a few people have said local radio announced it a few minutes ago). i just thought the faceless part was funny.
capjack2000,no. very different. entity wagering in nv has only one book willing to take the wagers (cg) and is full of guys touting fake records and falsified roi percent .
capjack2000,i dont make wagers if i dont believe i have the best of it. if that makes me chronically disgruntled in your opinion then im fine living with that label.
dinkinc,its a lock that this show will be great and i never use the lock word..  so great to see your work coming to the national stage.  also so deserved.
dinkinc,pretty much sit in front of a computer all day walk my dog and eat crappy foods.... every few weeks i go out of town but not during hockey season
dinkinc,in vegas probably me because i like to reach.  been in the field for 40+ years.  you can ask  for a reference.  its not easy and each sport is different
dinkinc,1-1-1 the push was on our double bet so basically even for the  horses ...going to take a lot to pull this month out...  let us  start on saturday ....
dinkinc,master class lunch with   and  ....  always good to learn how far down the totem pole i am ....   two of the sharpest and most helpful people in the game
robpizzola,dick butkus was a linebacker. he has much less impact on an average game than a quarterback and therefore much less influence over a teams record. this isnt rocket science.
robpizzola,he literally cannot read a defense. relies on his coach to read the defense for him at the line of scrimmage. and hes woefully inaccurate. hes a nobody without mcvay.
robpizzola,sitting on the dock on an absolutely gorgeous weekend and just got an alert that the dybala/lukaku swap with man united is off. it doesnt get much better than this.
robpizzola,think about the scenarios if they dont unload marleau. it absolutely needed to happen. of course there was going to be a cost but this core needs to stay intact.
robpizzola,the year of the marathon bombings ortiz wasnt even in the lineup and the game finished over an hour before the first bomb went off. must have been another year.
robpizzola,yeah that was a complaint of many people but i honestly didn't care. they spent many seasons really building out the plot and i am fine that they accelerated it.

VegasRefund,this weeks players championship doesnt have a golfer with odds below 11/1.. cant remember the last time a big tournament like this didnt have a couple of clear cut favorites.
VegasRefund,sportscenter at 6 has to be one of the all time worst failures in tv history... espn marketed and hyped that show so hard.. and it crashed just as hard.
ProfessorShine,lol theyre using your signup info to flip to affiliates. thats reason enough to stay away. let alone the ridiculous email solicitations begging you to buy more stuff from experts.
ProfessorShine,i have this dream where im a part of the committee and i get to pick dukes region.  it would have more landmines than bosnia.   and be in the west.
suuma810,im having a hard time with a team not even  trying when you have watson and hopkins on your team. sure its a low probability situation but not even trying?
suuma810,ich vertrete generell die meinung dass der draft weitestgehend glckssache ist. wre ich gm htte ich grundstzlich lieber me hour picks mit me hour value zur ver field goal ung.
suuma810,"playing around with  and my newly acquired flawed r skills. got something for the remaining 'establish the run' truthers.

epa/run vs. epa/dropback for every team in every game since 2009."
suuma810,they had a top-10 or top-5 pass rush last year with houston ford and jones. they could have kept both edge guys  use their 1st rounder to upgrade their secondary.
suuma810,the total in the #cowboys / #panthers game got bet down from 44 to 42.5 in some places yesterday. opener was 44.5. coaching tendencies will be crucial in this one.
ClevTA,id say baker is ahead so far right now but if u compared the ol and the lack of skill position for darnold its a lot closer than raw numbers
ClevTA,was that the series against houston? he was the only one who could defend harden and was out fast breaking the rockets. that series alone was worth taking a shot
ClevTA,just talking about this year. he's had a couple monster games and some medicore games mixed in. he's been really good just that godwin has been more valuable this season
ClevTA,browns have played teams ranked 1-4 in dvoa defense this year and pitt is about to be 1-5. based on rankings going into yesterday. just brutal def sked so far
ClevTA,its pretty clear that while the ne d is very very good its far from all time great good based on today. there are yards to be had on them
ClevTA,i thought there was overreaction after the luck news and 7-8 wins is doable but 3rd in mvp is ridiculous. that would mean 11-12 wins and a big statistical season
CizzlingSports,incase you missed it  # worst of all time   predictably died on the hill that cle should not have gone for 2 after cutting bal's lead to 9 in 2h.
CizzlingSports,(3/x)similarly its not clear whether the 935 plays were past-posted all at once to the auditor on 2/19/19 or instead provided to the auditor in real-time before each play posted.
CizzlingSports,i'm sure  $99/year subscribers are thrilled clay sold them a 1 unit play on the psu under while giving it out as a 3-unit play to the plebes for free.
CizzlingSports,given recent events  it is  unfathomably weak that that anyone associated with  sees fit to criticize  betting strategy including  who is down -299.25 units including -49.03 units in mlb lol
CizzlingSports,"""virginia doesnt run away from anyone"" [wrong]

spanky,"i am not a fan of that fraudster. 

i am in awe on his ability to market himself that well given he knows nothing about being a winning sports bettor."
spanky,"and if my guys like  think low of guys like me its all good baby baby. 

they can all think whatever they want. just write my action and pay me."
spanky,i find it fascinating how much svp caress about proving his handicapping superiority to some random twitter dude.  the monday luxuries of betting monopoly money... back to doing my figures
spanky,so im driving through northern ireland and come across this place in a small town called rathfriland.  guy tells me theyve been here for 30 years. this is the original
DocBettor,thanks for sharing all of these   what do you have if wisconsin wins now? might've missed it but i think that would be scenario (6) oregon/ou/lsu/clemson/wisconsin # college football playoff
DocBettor,"what feels worse? #gamblingtwitter #sportsbetting

a) passed on betting under 9 and seeing it close under 8

b) betting under 9 and seeing 6 runs in the first 2 innings"
PlusEVAnalytics,whats a good investment strategy for someone who believes that growth is overrated (and possibly evil)? buy stocks with high dividend yield? short everything thats sexy and in the news?
PlusEVAnalytics,what is it about the end of this bridge - little bass riff into modulation into 4 chord guitar progression - that triggers every pleasure center in my brain? #armchairmusicologist
PlusEVAnalytics,im picking games that i expect to win 52-53 percent  of the time so i probably cant claim my 64 percent  win rate as evidence that im good at this...
PlusEVAnalytics,its quite possible that im modeling something incorrectly but there is an efficient frontier of optimal strategies and i have the worst strategy on the frontier at +30 percent  ev.
PlusEVAnalytics,im not so sure about that. can i come up with a strategy that is good enough to overcome the 8 percent  vig? still working on it but leaning yes.
PlusEVAnalytics,the difference is that im not betting 60 percent  kelly because i made the 60 up out of thin air. im calculating it as a posterior estimate using bayesian inference.
PlusEVAnalytics,"not stem x not asian hits for a huge payout. i love correlated parlays!
a teen is set to graduate from high school and harvard within 11 days - cnn"
PlusEVAnalytics,the traditional actuarial approach is to fit a glm and then use that as a prior to weight with the observed data. i dont like how thats 2 separate steps.
aluckyaday,seems to be the way journalism works these days. if you want access you publish/ask the questions we tell you to. at least andrew neil refused to toe the line!
aluckyaday,want to know why there are problems in the nhs? this graph pretty much sums it up. i'm guessing other public services look the same. must be the immigrants fault!
aluckyaday,you will always be behind others. being in front of the books he places the bets with is all that matters. and there are a lot of books out there!
aluckyaday,totally up to them how they spend their marketing budget. they are marketeers by trade not bookmakers so i'm sure they know what works much better than you or me!
aluckyaday,"not sure how ""a firm commitment never to have checks at the irish border"" is compatible with ""the regulatory zone must have the consent of those effected by it""? #brexit"
aluckyaday,do you think fuglsang will have any support left at the end? if so who? i would think they will need 2 to beat alla unless he really is tired.
aluckyaday,i'm not really saying they  daily fantasy sports  understand it i'm saying it does not give them any useful information about which bookmaker to use to back their chosen horse.
joeytunes2,"must be. i called they said you must be a profitable player. i said ooh so you throw out profitable players. ""no"" ooh you lower them to movie ticket bets."
joeytunes2,these guys are crazy. appreciate what you have. if you weren't a nfl star you would be a cook at outback. stop making all this noise.. ps: hopkins is better
joeytunes2,to my first 25 people heres our ticket. its 500 to u guys. i'm splitting the dime. i wanted to get us the right number. 500 to the first 25.
joeyisaks,kovalev cant take body shots and canelo does that the best zzzzz ... but chance to go watch mexican fight fans and russian fight fans sign me up im going
EdMillerPoker,if you're a software engineer who likes sports and gambling honestly this might be your perfect job. you will learn a ton about sports betting and have fun doing it.
EdMillerPoker,while i think its a little silly how people talk about pinnacle style think its a bit unfair to ding them here. in-play player props are v hard to price.
EdMillerPoker,not surprised found a bunch of useful strategy nuggets myself doing that and i knew they were novel bc i could search and see if anyone else was using them
EdMillerPoker,a tell that someone is likely full of shit even in their own area of expertise is if they claim to know  what the fuck  is going on in syria.
EdMillerPoker,"ianal obv but as someone trying to do business in the space i agree with the premise that ""stealing"" is rampant and basically shouldn't be tolerated the way it is."
EdMillerPoker,this is exactly what i need to know as i still listen to the same bands i liked when i was 14 which is now 25 years ago and.. yeah..
LeeSharpeNFL,finally a good week in the 538 contest! this has been a rough year for my model unfortunately. hoping to get into the 90th percentile in the last two weeks.
LeeSharpeNFL,eddie jackson continues to be my favorite chicago bear. he may have only 1 interception compared to 6 last year but interceptions are fluky. this shows he's still very good.
LeeSharpeNFL,want to track all nine games at once? here's my scoreboard! updates every 60 seconds. works great on the side of your monitor or mobile. no ads or other bullshit.
whale_capper,nfl fantasy prep with a gambling spin... we welcome back  to gauge the state of the fantasy community and have a fun conversation strategizing for a best ball draft. enjoy!
whale_capper,the rail bias at churchill downs has been a thing going back to calvin borel in like 2010 how would you incorporate it into the handicap for this years running
AndyMSFW,i kind of want one of those cool ones they wear on the nfl pre-game shows now.  also my hoodie has no lapels. would i have to wear a sportscoat?
AndyMSFW,fun podcast last night.  we go over all the plays we have for the week so far and why including the side and total for tonight's  thursday night football  tilt.
AndyMSFW,"part ii for #theopen 
brought to you by the lovely ms. spiranac who is riding a three-week winning streak as a background ( daily fantasy sports  fail me now paige):"
AndyMSFW,weather is huge as well as what time of day the player tees off as there can be big changes in the weather/wind/condition of the course from morning to afternoon.
AndyMSFW,"just a way to make multiple parlays.  if you ""round-robin"" 4 teams you're making a four-team parlay 4 three-team parlays  6 two-team parlays.  it makes all eleven combinations for you."
JoeyKnish22,"*steelers walk in locker room*

*players frustrated*

*coaches in disbelief over playcall*

*tomlin looks directly at the kicker and punter* 

which of you boys has ever taken a wildcat snap"
JoeyKnish22,barrett isnt gonna win on that shit bucs d. jordan not enough production. dont think bosa wins as a rookie. its either gilmore donald or watt. ill take the +900.
JoeyKnish22,is eli producing tonight? cause i want to dunk on him like james wiseman for trashing our future will see what he says when memphis cashes our 40/1 in march!
JoeyKnish22,pat  need some help here getting this accepted and i dont see any maction player props? assuming you just took a long lunch and theyll be up soon 5k limits.
JoeyKnish22,hey guys sorry phone was stolen earlier while i was in line at popeyes ignore any messages you got from me today. some real degen loser must have had it
JoeyKnish22,i like him. should be much more productive in this system. doubt lsu is good enough for him to win it but worth a flyer if the offense pans out.
TheKostos,ravens will get the ball down by the goal line and bring ingram in for a  touchdown . book it. and i will lose my fantasy matchup when that happens
TheKostos,it was an outrageous decision. i loved it bc i bet dallas but still its so bad. and i love aikman just destroying the cowboys coaching staff on the broadcast
TheKostos,matt gay has missed three extra points. a field goals worth of xp. he's going to screw this over up and be the biggest piece of shit this nfl season
TheKostos,watching the nfl spin job about the pass interference review rule. al riveron sucks and should be fired and the league office should be embarrassed by this bullshit mockery sham
TheKostos,"finally watching this week's aew and my word it is awesome. reminds me why i love the medium.  it is  pro wrestling with soul. 

and a helluva promo by cody."
TheKostos,it is  fucking amazing to have the nba back in our lives tonight. capping tonight's card and three spots stand out. will share them in the 6pm et hour  tonight
LockyLockerson,toronto-lakers during nfl season in the sunday night 9:30 et time slot? i think these were the exact conditions when kobe scored 82 (except it was a couple months later).
LockyLockerson,i really enjoy this gif but probably not early october.  hockey first periods are the things that get me from  college football  winding down to march madness.  would guess thanksgiving-ish.
LockyLockerson,". i would never speak in absolutes but that being said....i am absolutely positive your ""games that almost made it"" are going undefeated this week.   it is  a phenomenal group."
LockyLockerson,i would say this is like belichick not calling his timeouts in a super bowl except he actually did that and they won anyway because darrell bevell is an idiot
LockyLockerson,if the closing number was weird on each of their last couple games then that would cause this number to be weird as well.  just kind of a domino effect.
EliHershkovich,i'm never anti-eli (for obvious reasons) and not many average qbs could string together those super bowl runs. but i'd take rivers over him in a heartbeat stats-driven or not.
EliHershkovich,"favorite players heading into the draft:

DannyParkins,if im jason garrett im not risking zeke getting any more touches up 27 points with 11 minutes left. zero upside. id pull dak and any banged up o-lineman too.
DannyParkins,youve gotta be seriously insecure to read that as a knock on mahomes man. relax my opinions on pat are well documented. i dont troll my former listeners or anyone.
DannyParkins,first interview with vince gilligan and aaron paul on el camino the breaking bad movie. now *this* is the type of thing that absolutely will get me to the theatre.
DannyParkins,oh man 90 yard  touchdown  run for travis etienne hes gonna put up absolutely monster numbers this year given teams wont be able to ever stack the box against him.
DannyParkins,congrats on the new gig awesome seeing  make a major commitment to covering the cubs even without the games. very impressed with what theyre doing for the local sports fan.
DannyParkins,my wife just listened to our segment on push presents from yesterday and would like a rebuttal. its the subject of tannes open so shell be on right after 2:00...
chadmillman,"doing the pregame show on  this season with live line moves + big bets coming in was thrilling. excited to bring this to more stations. appreciate

2009 detroit lions: +10.2
2007 buffalo bills: +9.8
2010 buffalo bills: +9.8"
chadmillman,private jet for myself. also once approved a yacht for wright thompson story on tiger woods. also im guessing you missed what i threw in my expense report this week...
chadmillman,"great question: 862-801-5116.

seriously thats our  hotline for fans to call if they need to vent. the messages are too funny. we will compile and share in audio and text."
chadmillman,it is incredibly exciting for  that someone of  skill  talent joins our team. hes going to provide a pov on nba with pieces podcasts  video that enhances everything we do.
Gingfacekillah,as some readers have pointed out the simulation methodology contained in the article (provided you process for deriving team lambdas is decent) is also a helpful tool for soccer forecasting.
Gingfacekillah,i see someone talked to zimmer about the idea that the pass threat creates run opportunities. bad news for my 2 props on cousins but good news for minutes -5.5.
Gingfacekillah,nba pointspread margins of victory: actual system estimate closing line. note that market price opportunities exists at the individual game level but are fairly rare. #handicapping #handicappers #nba #sharpaction #pointspreads
logan_matthews9,im not really sure you understand hard capped. the only negative is that it helps the celtics but maybe the memphis pick would convince them. i do think its unlikely
logan_matthews9,wright and carleton probably dont belong in this group yet... but to your question - they are people with high ceilings and low floors who stayed closer to the latter.
logan_matthews9,"three for four tonight! plus our four bets for tomorrow are all sharp - a couple extremely so!

no/chi under 234 down to 229.5
den/mem under 208 down to 204.5"
PikachuBets,when the median total is 2.5 in a market then goals are worth a lot. try for moneyline up to -130 if your -0.5 sucks (theyre the same exact bet)
PikachuBets,"really showing us how they are not a good team but a great team!  field goal  cover 2h cover but lose the game by 1. lol ""great teams cover"" indeed"
PikachuBets,sharing courts is cool and all but this keeping multiple sets of lines on the floor thing is getting out of hand. what is this whose line is it anyway?
PikachuBets,after this much trash cucking over the past three weeks i'm never going to fucking venice and i  daily fantasy sports  care who the fuck tries to convince me otherwise
PikachuBets,good one klay. we give ourselves the luxury of having six hours of live market movement before we go on the air with $100 recommended picks. real winning strategy there.
PikachuBets,he blatantly lied about his record last year. well-documented fudging and unit inflation. this year is the only real year we have. not promising even from closing line value standpoint
PikachuBets,no. their self interest shouldve always been with gambling. they are bozos bc now this is bad pr and never underestimate that if the right people get behind this story
PikachuBets,still exclusively using best of luck numbers instead of wa lines eh? you can't pledge innocent ignorance at this point anymore; you're pretty much being willfully ignorant of market realities.
adamchernoff,another interesting thought there. so if there was a nj only exchange - for example - you think money from all over the country would inevitably find a way in?
adamchernoff,expressvpn at the moment. i am not doing any free stream garbage. i just want to pay for decent subscriptions each month and have a reliable service that looks good.
adamchernoff,"double bets stay perfect on the season for  as readers of my weekly blog cash in on jets vikings over 47.

Ccon8181,"gonna get this bet out there as line is continuing to move. lets get the weekend started:

#colorado +11.5 -110 

# college football  #uscvscu # college football ootball #espn2 #skininthegame"
Ccon8181,prime example of a lottery the operator wants nothing but this type of action. where even if you win the payout is way less than the actual odds of occurrence.
Ccon8181,if there was ever a team to hedge against its the #cavs .. up 12 at half laying 8 only -1 2nd half and struggle to put teams away. smh
Ccon8181,that is  what i get backing david shaw back to back weeks. run and punt when he has 7pt lead. blowout was in grasp but bad read on my end
Ccon8181,no doubt i had skin on the game but #spurs came up with the ball and had their shot to win... and missed.  daily fantasy sports  blame the refs. #okcvssas
Ccon8181,no i'm not mia i was looking at #utahjazz but not as strong a play as i would of liked plus bad number so i passed. still like the side
kellyinvegas,huh? what are you mumbling about? there are 17 weeks. each week on the sunday show i give out a best bet. theyre 12-4-1 on the season. math. is. hard.
kellyinvegas,this isnt fraudulent. i talked about this game all week on  and  ive been told no one cares you got a better number kelly so ive stopped talking about it.
ToddFuhrman,so  it is  better to keep deserving teams out? c'mon barret a playoff expansion doesn't devalue the regular season at all  daily fantasy sports  become a member of that camp.
ToddFuhrman,you should be very proud to still be in the pool using the same team as 90 percent  of your competition going to get you a lot closer to winning
ToddFuhrman,there might not be a man out there  that is  forgotten more about sports history than most people will ever learn in  ; guy's a walking encyclopedia across all sports
TheCousinSal,hey  - when the  is paying for your ringside seat the least you can do is sit their respectfully and enjoy the action. wrestling doesnt need these types of shenanigans.
TheCousinSal,"if you have time check out my nl east preview below:

TheCousinSal,ill never question jason garretts play-calling again. so far hes been able to put up a whole 7 points using merely the best offensive players the nfc has to offer.
TheCousinSal,rusty staub would come to the plate wearing a pair of isotoners choke up a mile and then hit it just as far. he was a joy to watch. #riprusty
12Xpert,how do you set about distinguishing market evolution from mean regression? or is referring to the latter just a fancy way of saving face when your strategy goes tits up?
12Xpert,it might be but i think it can be a fine line. they way the law has treated individual responsibility in criminal cases has evolved over time. it isn't fixed.
12Xpert,"from the paper talent vs luck:
the role of randomness in success and failure this is the essential take home message for bettors. stop judging your success by your profits."
12Xpert,most racing tipsters would average much longer than 3.43 although it would also be true to say that the no-skill expectation would be more greatly negative because of favourite-longshot bias.
12Xpert,theres really no contradiction im consistent in saying that the proportion of sharps at a sharp book is too small to reveal itself in the wider distribution of all performances.
12Xpert,ok i  daily fantasy sports  have cl in may sample since i  daily fantasy sports  have those results but i can do the rest. will get on to it tomorrow.
12Xpert,that is indeed the question. for the sample in the article the most likely explanation is chance (p-value = 0.12) but a longer record may change this. time will tell.
mschwimer,i said it was unlikely to happen in the short term. but it certainly could. and we wouldnt want to take proactive steps to help that happen by betting ourselves.
mschwimer,if people like you dont sign up its impossible for me to blow up. only way i get exposed is if a ton of people sign up and i lose.
mschwimer,no. i have always said closing line value matters. its a mathematical fact. its just not the end all be all. can still be very successful without getting great clv.
mschwimer,you do the math. how likely is it for us to be +242 units over 2769 plays if we have no edge? answer is more than 1 in a million.
mschwimer,question for eagles fans.. who are you rooting for in the superbowl? do u want the title to go to the nfc east? or r u rooting for the pats?
RufusPeabody,i agree with that seth. but i also think 1-loss ou edges out 1-loss penn state that does not win big ten as well as whoever wins the pac-12.
RufusPeabody,with 1000 plays (the minutes amount) that means expectation for a coin flipper would be -45 units. so the guarantee still requires someone to believe jambos has some skill
RufusPeabody,"(1) normal quantile plot of golfer historical over/underperformance going into majors since 2017

RufusPeabody,bettors: whats the worst run youve ever had? (the kind of run where anyone seeing it would think this person cant possibly be a winner.) whats your best run?
RufusPeabody,i was just saying you should find the big nascar  daily fantasy sports  guys and go h2h offsite with them like you did with preston for  college football  betting.
jeffma,there are lots of objections... negative roi misleading marketing tactics misaligned incentives... and yes the sports tout business is not the only industry that is subject to these concerns
SportsCheetah,i dont think anybody did but oregon/utah/bama/uga each lost down the stretch. not sure what else they do this season there for #4 without saying the losses dont matter.
SportsCheetah,the raptors e field goal  percent  is 9 points higher when pascal siakam is on the floor.  it is  the second-highest positive difference in the league. who's no. 1?
SportsCheetah,haha i didn't bet the game just watching it confused as he went for it from that far out. thinking he just thought he was closer to the hoop.
SportsCheetah,hes averaging 3 blocks and 1.6 steals while shooting 37 percent  from 3 on nearly 4 attempts per game. would take a wild guess that that hasnt happened before.

capjack2000,pa has a one skin per casino policy so at most there will be only 12 in pa. i predict they'll reconsider that regulation within a year or two.
dinkinc,it took them 25 minutes to decide and now the suspension makes the foul look flagrant. also it occurred in the stretch and involved the leaders.  worst job possible

ProfessorShine,the goal of legalized market is to grab every short term $ possible and worry about repercussions later.  politicians believe this pie is 150-200billion when its closer to 30b.
ProfessorShine,people in general follow the money. but adding context to these bets (theyre at worse than market odds etc) is at least an attempt to keep sports books honest.

ClevTA,that would be ballsy to take the 1 l team that lost to the other 1 l team for the conference championship. i dont know how that works logically
ClevTA,no way man. worst case moore has to go length of the field for a  touchdown . this isnt just to kick a  field goal . apples to oranges
ClevTA,yes although a lot of that is bc its their division. but the browns schedule in the back half is as easy as the pats in the first half
ClevTA,whats the deal with mostert? every time he plays he puts up big numbers. 7.2 ypc on 41 carries in regular season and 5.1 in his career in preseason

spanky,i see so many line sets so i can spot a strong move from a weak move from a phony move.... its hard with only a few line sets
spanky,my above tweet is based on bad juice which could cripple a bookmaker.  bad spread or total is a different animal but similar measures should be put in place.
spanky,seeing this reminds me of the days when offshore shops were in their infancy especially  and they would scalp themselves on their pickem spread line vs their moneylines. #goodoldays

PlusEVAnalytics,the priors are selected judgementally. the best thing to do is select a few different sets of priors and calculate a posterior from each to get a reasonable range.
PlusEVAnalytics,perhaps after the brightest minds in sports analytics solve the foul trouble problem they can start on when to fair catch a punt and when to let it bounce?
PlusEVAnalytics,its a free option for you. if the line moves in your favour you can pretend you got the better line or just not enter the bet at all.
PlusEVAnalytics,inspired by billy hamilton: should mlb teams use one of their roster spots and pay an olympic sprinter the minimum salary to just pinch run in high leverage situations?

joeytunes2,life of a sports bettor. i'm taking the day off!  daily fantasy sports  bother me! haha been 45 months of 7 days a week. and only small card today.
joeytunes2,its beating a dead horse with these books. they just dont want to book. they want to turn it into casino games. were they hold edges on everyone period.
joeyisaks,isnt that how every sport translates to new talent every 10-15 years? coulda said same thing with sampras / agassi when they were at the top 20 years ago

LeeSharpeNFL,as you note they are heavily favored against min. if they win they are also favorites in gb despite it being in gb and gb cooking off the bye.
LeeSharpeNFL,i doubt miami would give up all 3. but i  daily fantasy sports  think 2 and some change (later round picks or a swap favorable to cin) is insane.
LeeSharpeNFL,this is a really good thread (especially the lamar rocketship). definitely want to think about it as i look more at epa/play situational tweaks giving me some good ideas....
LeeSharpeNFL,"colts now tied with the texans at 6-4 and lead the afc south by winning the first game between them as the tiebreaker.

whale_capper,simmons seems completely content with his game as it is not interested in improving his shooting which is a bigger potential problem long term and especially wrt playoff impact
AndyMSFW,there seems to be some confusion since there are two universities with similar names playing tomorrow.  i am wagering on fiu +3.5 vs north texas at 8:30 p.m. central.
AndyMSFW,patriot league update: colgate +110 into the final where i'm guessing they'll be a 4 to 5 point favorite.  lehigh couldn't get there today for the easy money final.
JoeyKnish22,its definitely do-able but would require a large capital investment from 2 entities (nfl owners and ncaa) mostly concerned with pillaging every cent as opposed to quality of product.
JoeyKnish22,if you factor in where they got the players. mclaurin (round 4) harmon (round 7) sims (udfa). thats an absolutely insane haul with almost no quality draft capital used.
JoeyKnish22,"if you grabbed lsu futures early szn.  i took clemson +195 this morning.

took $1000/$1950.

gonna sit back and enjoy the game. will likely have some props."
JoeyKnish22,both guys legitimately more dangerous as runners but im shocked its this one sided. i actually think hot trub is the marginally better passer. allen much better intangibles  tho.
JoeyKnish22,if lsu wins out and isnt the 1 seed. i dont want to overreact. but i want the committee members who voted for osu #1 imprisoned in guantanamo bay.

JoeyKnish22,could be nothing. he might have just been guessing but reggie miller just said on the broadcast he has a gut feeling zion doesnt play at all this year.
JoeyKnish22,i feel like i would need to mix 3 red bulls with some crystal meth to get to this level for 7 minutes. the #kostoscoaster is a wild ride.
TheKostos,trubisky and flacco both have the same injury. its called a coach doesnt want to play him anymore sprain. ive heard its quite painful  for what  it is  worth

LockyLockerson,5d has ucf 100/1 to win the cfp and tennessee (who will be infinity better than ucf this season) 350/1.  y'all will just never learn with this ucf stuff.

EliHershkovich,biased cause i have terps futures but it was their sixth game in almost two weeks. ayala actually found his offense and they need him to space the floor.
EliHershkovich,not disagreeing but a small sample size. elite opponents turn it on imo (arizona and maryland). considering illinois 1h or full-game play depending on where the # gets to.
EliHershkovich,agreed. scherzer is the clear-cut best pitcher in the game plus strasburg and corbin undergoing positive regression. just need a little bullpen help to pair with a surging lineup.
DannyParkins,lol of course i was the one upset about it. the full video and segment is linked in the station account. twitter only allows this length of highlight video.

Gingfacekillah,yes there will. i think the kindle version will be more useful for readers trying to follow along in excel but both formats will be available when its released.
Gingfacekillah,some of my biggest breakthroughs came on the backs of stinging losses. i gained insight into a flaw or found a faulty assumption that i was able to discard.

12Xpert,would love to see the data not being an xg aficionado myself. if true it would add further weight to the claim of being the greatest of all time.
12Xpert,if you like using percentage staking (e.g. kelly) then my latest  article explains how your range of performances is log-normally distributed. i've built another little calculator for this too.
12Xpert,sorry i suppose i should say efficient affiliate programme since at least you've bothered to reply albeit robotically. frankly  it is  not fit for purpose.  it is  a joke.
12Xpert,ok to my knowledge i never published the file of match results on the website. perhaps you are confusing it with the wisdom of crowds results which is available.
12Xpert,i'm not studying what goes into it just seeing how it performs relative to bookmakers. started today by seeing what sort of profit it returns to closing pinny prices.
12Xpert,the bigger problem is still outstanding: you simply can't claim to have discovered a profitable betting system with methodology like this and   has crunched the numbers to confirm this.

SportsCheetah,rodgers has made some abysmal throws tonight. two easy misses last drive on 2nd and 3rd down that resulted in the  field goal  and then whatever that was.

SportsCheetah,i'd have to check to be certain but i think there's a slight downward trend on pace/plays per game toward the back end of the season generally too.
SportsCheetah,yeah i remember when this one came out last season. i didn't bet bucks under just the direction i would go if i had to at this point.
SportsCheetah,its usually at least an hour wait even at 2-3am but theres a second location off the strip a little ways thats rarely busy and has normal hours.
capjack2000,"made a total of one single $10 wager in the casino and hit a royal flush. not bad. 

oh wait i'm being told that wasn't their only wager..."
capjack2000,they  daily fantasy sports  say...maybe parimutuel maybe just tax the handle instead of the revenue...there's a lot of ways to make sausage none of them you'll find appetizing.
capjack2000,we've since learned that targeting higher hold percent  comes about by encouraging long-shot parlays high vig futures and eliminating those who only lose at a 4-5 percent  rate.
capjack2000,oct margin is typically lower than sept margin for a variety of reasons. however i think margin will uptick slightly in october. i project about 9 percent  hold.
capjack2000,"hey  remind us again how much revenue gvc made last year worldwide? 

the 3rd largest bookmaker in the world is afraid of someone beating nfl sides. 

nfl sides."
capjack2000,they have not launched yet. you can sign up for updates at  but just to warn you i signed up long ago and there hasnt been any updates.
capjack2000,eventually they might with the eldorado deal. czr also has a deal with draftkings. eldorado also has a deal with betstars. it could get messy down the line.
capjack2000,those who attended the  live event in hoboken a couple weeks ago got the full scoop. needless to say contraction will occur in the nj.  it is  inevitable.
capjack2000,"this is the best thing youll read today. tremendously well-written profile of  and the new world of legal sports betting. 

congratulations  on a landmark article for this industry."
capjack2000,tilman fertitta owner of golden nugget owns the houston rockets. nv allows him to book all but hou games while nj doesn't permit any nba at his book.
capjack2000,to be fair on that point fd has them both priced at -110 on either side of either prop. however i agree with the need to account/explain vig.
capjack2000,in case you missed it earlier...i discussed with mitch  pauly just how good the nj sports betting market is for consumers.  it is  airing again right now on
dinkinc,for someone who has been in the television / film industry for 20 years you have 2 followers. thats one every ten years.  are you harvey weinsrein ?
dinkinc,robin quivers.  also with a woman who appeared to be twelve months pregnant when the woman got off robin and i looked at each other and cracked up
dinkinc,if i was president i would prioritize finding a cure for cancer and stay out of north korea.  also would end daylight savings time.  best fake president ever
robpizzola,someone should tell anthony lynn that every game is a meaningless game. seems to be lucking his way into good in-game decisions because he doesn't know any better.
VegasRefund,i think it has to do more with east coast vs. west coast than the actual team... half the country is sleeping for most of the angels games.
ProfessorShine,hes the most conservative head coach in the league.  4th and long isnt egregious but he seems to have an abnormal john foxian love of  field goal s
ProfessorShine,a previous year he was giving out plays on tiny limit marketing openers that changed off of 1 bet.   his followers were dismayed they missed the line move.
ProfessorShine,browns are rare injury exception.  the market is more efficient later in the week as more people bet.  many people would crush the majority of stagnant mid-week lines
ProfessorShine,they know they would fail at it.  anyone can tout and the bigger following and branding the more sales.  youre talking out of your bunghole.  id rather bet.
ProfessorShine,wg and spoint are much better books than anything stateside right now but both sportsbook directors admit they look to large offshores to be aligned with the market.
suuma810,"in the month of november the green bay #packers offense ranks 32nd in yards per dropback (4.1).

(the sample size is three games but  it is  still funny)"
suuma810,i still kinda believe in healthy cam and i would love to see him healthy on the field next year whether  it is  panthers or a different team.
suuma810,my concern is the high turnover production despite poor play-by-play performance. defense could progress but hard to replace those 27 turnovers. either way cant wait for september buddy
suuma810,if the #jets dont trade down such a pick makes a lot of sense. edge rush is a big need as well but the fa class looks promising.
suuma810,the number we are allowed to see is the spread and it moved from -5 to -6 and then -6.5 yesterday with more chicago money hitting the market.
suuma810,*doubt that all of them do that. dedication/passion etc. sean mcvay spends a lot of time studying opposing defenses and their concepts to understand how to attack them.
suuma810,"the #seahawks  went 75 percent  run on first down yesterday (18 runs for 39 yards) and had a 100-yard rusher (carson 102). they won 24-13.

trust the process."
suuma810,the #dolphins were close from making my final card. i think they are underpriced my pr line is fins -1.5. staying away because of ryan tannehill's long absence.
suuma810,"agree on the obvious choices. and it might be the ""easiest"" game for the saints on paper. is it a pool you can only use a team once?"
suuma810,i  daily fantasy sports  think so because the topic is how good the seahawks would be without russell wilson in comparison to the league in this very moment.
ClevTA,i guarantee indy coaching staff saw this. one pump to the right and back to doyle down the seam for a monster gain. bet we see it again
ClevTA,so do we all feel a little vindicated in seattle or do we need like 2 more blowout ls to feel like the world is right again? lol
ClevTA,doesnt have to be an advanced stat although many of those have cinci as they worst or 2nd worst pass d. yards per carry is one basic way
ClevTA,new mexico might be the bad beat of the year if they score v hawaii here. trying to score 28 points in the final 7m of the game
CizzlingSports,"and # worst of all time   crying abt the ending of ari but they're not the ""betting public"" nope no way these guy are the legit troo shraps"
CizzlingSports,"as long as he's replying to you pls ask him for the umpteenth time how many units followers are supposed to bet on the blood bank playz

tia"
CizzlingSports,get ready the  guy who didn't know the difference between -110 and -115 is gonna 'splain to u why the metz are good future bet *sam jackson meme*
CizzlingSports,"made of list of ppl to meat in real lyfe strange to leave off santa clause and the easter bunny  what the fuck 

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,cashed out like $500 in chips after playing blackjack and had to get approval at cage etc. place was a complete dump in every single possible way lol
CizzlingSports,"lots going on here but as usual seems like   gambooling expert still bets at the only book on earth that doesn't charge juice

# worst of all time"
spanky,once you have kids and accept the fact that many lives depend on your ability to earn the hustle goes to an all time high and never dies.
spanky,99.9 percent  of the accounts i bet into are via betting partners where my involvement is unknown to the bookmaker... your claim is bullshit but thanks for trying.
spanky,i would love to if someone would grant me a license. no max bet is irresponsible. i would have posted house limits though that would always be honored....
spanky,despite how high the total is the nfl 3 maintains its status as the champion of football lines.  disrespect the 3 and your destiny will result in peril.
spanky,i completely disagree with you. trying to bet that and get away with it is stealing.  one of the few places left in nj that let me bet.
PlusEVAnalytics,maybe this is all a ploy to get you to split the bet into two tickets and they can move the lines in between. well played oregon lottery...
PlusEVAnalytics,id use the same ingredients (strokes gained components) but perhaps in a slightly different way. the only new thing id incorporate is weather if the data is available.
aluckyaday,daily fantasy sports  like mince pies. sacrilege i know. but the whole concept of gambling clashes with the christian ethic. too much hypocrisy in this campaign for me.
aluckyaday,what makes you think companies have been in the bookmaking business since before vegas even had a railroad are only in the us market to pump and dump?
aluckyaday,not listened yet but guessing you have to factor in the backups in key positions? as although injuries are random the effect will be different on different teams?
aluckyaday,yep. but they lose more doing luckies because of the compounding effect of the bias. i would think permed luckies are a big red flag for any account!
aluckyaday,the same tweet is talking bollocks and talking sense. the joys of betting twitter  thanks for your input very long time since i've been in a uk shop.
aluckyaday,that is what i meant really. probability of getting your yield (what you put in g10) or better by chance if you are betting with no margin. (f3=0)
aluckyaday,let me guess many cases but not all cases? so you adjusted the conditions and odds ranges until you found a criteria that gave you the best return?
theFirmAISports,"#supercontest #nfl

last weeks picks went 2-3

10-10 overall (50 percent ) frustrating first quarter of the season.. need to make up ground this week. 

week 5 picks:"
joeytunes2,move a game for me  let me see. i try not hit screen why give the books leads. to adjust..dm ill teach you how the game is won.
joeytunes2,lebron is out of it. hes doing documentrys. he doesnt have it in him anymore. pretty clear why he chose la. and  it is  not ball or kuzma
joeyisaks,wow monte carlo wont refund my ticketz  to tournament even to a usa patron like me who canceled entire trip to europe. red card for monte carlo tournament?
joeyisaks,if you look at the  college football  lines fly today its ras hitting them when jambo gets that kind of respect from the market then you can talk
joeyisaks,do students who paid their own way or had family save up for years and work multiple jobs to send their kid to college get a refund too?
EdMillerPoker,a thing ppl do is compare a well-executed business with one model to a poorly executed business with a different model and conclude the model was the thing
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  disagree but would say be a little patient. they can't compete on price because there's currently zero usable source of pricing information for american sports
EdMillerPoker,lol i knew something like this would happen but to actually see it is still amazing. gonna be a wild ride the next few years thats for sure.
EdMillerPoker,it is  us-focused for sure. there's no specific handicapping info in the book though  it is  more about how markets work and how to look at things logically.
EdMillerPoker,im no slot expert at all but like ge is a simple well-designed and popular game and im sure performs well precisely due to its key game mechanic.
EdMillerPoker,and in what way does cryptoizing it lift those barriers to existence/adoption? (obv i dont think the crypto part moves the needle on making internet-based prediction market viable.)
GolcondaFund,"lol so easy to play the confirmation card isn't it boss?

and based on when it matters performance in the playoffs by your logic so too does lj..."
GolcondaFund,"lol look at you with your ad hominem back hands. you troll can't handle being poor handicap?
lol then dig for ammo.
who you trying to fool #square"
GolcondaFund,"did you do circa?
we are 12-2-1 there get extra night to sleep on sc picks. been helping a lot so far except lw's jets -6.5....got too cute."
GolcondaFund,he literally passed up the ez out to jerome and guy looking them both off knowing they would choke and made the only viable play. that takes guts.
GolcondaFund,fiu returns too many. butch davis hc. 1st game. history of tight low scoring games vs ucf. under/fiu cover. prefer a tease of both. # college football pick
nonrandomalpha,how can we ignore that racist referees stole a chiefs super bowl victory? - might as well start cogitating on your divisive conspiracy theory ahead of time steve.
nonrandomalpha,its not *that* he does it its *why* he does it. obviously this is just my opinion and of course i could be wrong but thats my view.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm definitely higher on the seahawks than the market probably too high. look at the replies in my conversation with seth burn where we talk through this some.
LeeSharpeNFL,i can only annotate so many plays on my win probability charts this game is trying to see how many plays the code will be forced to omit.
LeeSharpeNFL,the file was corrupted it looked like which would make sense as to why it didn't attach to the tweet i guess. dunno why it got corrupted though!
LeeSharpeNFL,the difference is whether a player say got two feet in bounds or not is objective. either it happened or it didn't. pi is entirely a judgment call.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah i made an r function called grep_col() to search the names of columns of a data frame because i kept having ""hmm is this in nflscrapr?"" moments."
whale_capper,awesome double check that u10 +105 is pit and not phi... after that id take the arb at nitro (although btc looks choppy for the next few months)
AndyMSFW,the draw plays murder them even though he's likely not going to pass.  they should have him drop back 30 times in the 2nd half (for 0 attempts)
AndyMSFW,"as we mentioned on the sunday night podcast so far also on:
kc -6.5 -107
pats under 43.5 -105

and added 
indy -7 +100

everything in the spreadsheet"
AndyMSFW,the mac starts today at 7pm est.  turns out buffalo is very good but i hate money so i try to find a way to go against them.
JoeyKnish22,some very innocent good natured people may accidentally hit lines for the max that may be a couple points off assuming the book was just taking a position.
JoeyKnish22,nah if he stays healthy he should win it but all it takes is 1-2 games missed to throw you off pace. not worth it imo at +100.
JoeyKnish22,i couldnt have been more wrong on the hockenson pick. not trying to overreact to one game. but hes probably like the 8th best te in the league.
JoeyKnish22,that wont actually pay any money when the lions lose by 3 touchdowns sunday but you can at least tell your friends you crushed the market before kickoff.
JoeyKnish22,"its only preseason. no time to panic. but if jimmy g/this 49ers offense doesnt dramatically improve. 

boy oh boy do i have a lot of tweets to delete."
JoeyKnish22,got a peep of the new  ui from buddy north of the border looks fresh af. much needed improvement to the interface. hopefully rolls out smooth/functions well .
JoeyKnish22,jeff - joe knish with tnt. can we get some prop odds on where anthony davis signs next summer? heard youre the go to guy for those. thanks!
TheKostos,packers are going one-and-done in the playoffs unless rodgers goes nuts. and if rodgers goes nuts in the first game and they win they're losing the second game
TheKostos,zach ertz / jake elliott / eagles d tonight in a playoff matchup just need 16 to win. they currently have 12. at home. against the giants. lol
TheKostos,lacazette is about fifty yards offsides and these clowns review it and he's suddenly onside. what the fuck is the point of var???  it is  all made-up bullshit
TheKostos,"would people be interested in election betting coverage on  

would not feature political commentary. 

just analysis of the market and if there are smart bets to be made...."
LockyLockerson,nba afternoon update now published to the patreon page.  updated thoughts on every game plus i have a bet for tonight (after having no bets yesterday).  how delightful.
LockyLockerson,i have managed to avoid betting on the bulls a lot this year but with sabonis declared out i couldn't resist having a few bucks on it today.
LockyLockerson,so i can get pitcher splits based on each degree of temperature ballpark humidity at my fingertips but i can't get goalie splits of goals allowed by period?
LockyLockerson,just had  on the show.  crazy good information for fantasy/ daily fantasy sports  players with drafts coming up.   even though he doesn't think kirk cousins can win mvp.
LockyLockerson,2 things for today: first i once again remind everyone i wrote a book.  coming down the home stretch season starts soon appreciate everyone spreading the word! thanks!
LockyLockerson,"couple other pieces that are in the works for  in the coming weeks:

--nfl offensive rookie of year market
--nfl defensive rookie year market
--maybe first coach fired"
LockyLockerson,really fun to think about for the upcoming season but you would be hard pressed to find a worse lower-value set of futures in any sport offered anywhere.
LockyLockerson,i wanna see the shot of that shirtless old toronto fan still in the arena sitting silently reading a book like florida state book man 2 seasons ago
LockyLockerson,for the first time since either of my children was born i am going to a movie at a theater tonight. this is the highlight of my life.
LockyLockerson,lakers-warriors is the only late-start game and lebron is out.  this is the perfect night to finally start the new season of narcos: mexico when i get home.
LockyLockerson,half the second round still to come as well as final four and champion picks from eli and i after we talk about actual basketball with our friend
EliHershkovich,"incase you missed it :   podcast to get you prepped for the  weekend.

pumped to record with later. nfl/ college football / college basketball    and  on as well."
EliHershkovich,no juiston. no dante. oregon with a big time win at michigan. i'd invest in  futures at 25-1 or higher. this team will be scary good in march.
EliHershkovich,"glennon just tossed a  touchdown  but this was on the previous drive.

imagine missing a receiver this wide-open  getting handed a three-year $45 million deal two offseasons ago."
DannyParkins,theyre the 3 seed favored over 2 seed osu. vegas doesnt care about those rankings. ohio state would be favored over lsu too. this information is readily available.
DannyParkins,wendi nix the only espn nfl contributor to pick the bears to win the nfc. zero have them winning the super bowl. chiefs most popular pick with 12.
DannyParkins,someone needs to teach gus malzahn about going for 2. he put on a clinic in coaching against his best interest and hes gonna get away with it.
DannyParkins,can these teams stop whining and kicking their legs out on 3's and just play basketball at the highest level imaginable instead of looking for ref bailouts please?
chadmillman,i love that on a company-wide  call yday there was a total (2.5) of how many times  would say please go on mute. over hit in final minutes.
chadmillman,"7  year old counting places he has visited. ""dad have i been to vegas?"" 10  year old before i can answer: ""you would remember a trip to vegas"""
Gingfacekillah,"yep definitely a ""wisdom of the crowd"" type experiment like  has written about before - where the ""correct"" answer is that which is more popular than people predict."
Gingfacekillah,i cannot count the number of times i've revisited something a second or third time and found something new: a book an idea a strategy/method a former edge.
logan_matthews9,could be wrong but pretty sure only the top 20 spots are paid so cutoff would be the group tied for 17th (which split 4 percent  five ways)
logan_matthews9,honestly this is impressive. its a bet thats been available for weeks and was only at 66 for like an hour. some books never even hit this number!
logan_matthews9,"t10 percentages:

morikawa 74.6 percent 
cantlay 63.1 percent 
fowler 62.1 percent 
dj 50.1 percent 
lashley 45.1 percent 

could use bad days from woodland rahm niemann potson among others"
logan_matthews9,"the highest limits would be when you combine every book together.

pinny can tell a story but the market - which includes pinny - tells a better one."
logan_matthews9,right - if jambos end game is working with teams and the proof is we made money betting then im not sure why teams dont just employ bookmakers
PikachuBets,literally you have not paid back any money back so right now literally all of them are down from betting the plays. those are the facts. holy fuck
PikachuBets,cant tell if srs but i aint handing over shit to mycrookie let alone ag of all people. only in his dreams would he ever see our money
adamchernoff,"nfl week 4 for  with   and  

difficult to top the results from last sunday but i very much like the look of our card heading into the weekend."
adamchernoff,none. but the major networks in the us are all tracked on the odds screen and have a large influence on nfl prices because of their high limits.
adamchernoff,glad to hear. kind of entering a totally new world here so we will see how it does. i think it can help out a lot of bettors.
adamchernoff,well said. its often more important to have an accurate grade on the backup than the starter. cluster injuries make grading tricky too and often are over looked.
adamchernoff,red is a difference of less than 0.5 runs yellow is a difference of 0.5 to 0.9 runs and green is a difference of 1 run or more.
adamchernoff,if you believe that and disregard everything else that happened in the game there is no point in discussing this further because its a childish point of view.
Ccon8181,not the start to bowl season... #charlotte49ers all hype no action. props to #buffalo they were ready to play. didnt make it a vacation they were ready. #bahamasbowl
Ccon8181,"back at it.. backing sone shit teams but gotta do what you gotta do.

#wasvsbuf #nyjvsmia #indvspit #skininthegame"
Ccon8181,haha underrated tweet. ive debated for past few years wearing the all encompassing breathing mask. for real while im in the casino. that 2nd hand smoke is brutal
Ccon8181,#niu 0-5 against the spread in their last 5 bowl games... make it 0-6 with the same hc. guess he likes to start the offseason vacation time early.
Ccon8181,them and then syracuse blew a 16 point lead with 4 minutes left and a 10 point lead with a minute left to blow the cover at -4.5
Ccon8181,the teams shoot a combined 19 for 67 from 3 28.3 percent  and it lands on 214 so i deserve this ot. need it after the #rockets monday
Ccon8181,sorry to see that jd. was it a basal cell or something else? hope you make a full recovery. i just started being paranoid with this lv sun
Ccon8181,unreal bullshit on #steelers +2.5 on to the next. #nevspit gotta take the l and move on. a loss like that would put a novice bettor on tilt
Ccon8181,interesting decision by #butchjones to start a true freshman who can't throw in a do or die game try to kick  field goal  and sit on lead #scvstenn
Ccon8181,"team has been dog shit all year and not covered a damn thing but numbers back them so gotta hit it. #coni is invested in 

#tcu -3 -110"
Ccon8181,there are going to be bad offense nights. but when you back the #lakers and ingram shoots 18 times but only makes 3  it is  hard to overcome.
Ccon8181,if you have #rockets +13.5 right now i feel for you. no reason you should even have to sweat this out but  that is  why their the #rockets
kellyinvegas,my gif was in reference to everyone being triggered about everything all the time. the sky is falling constantly. so much bad stuff. just stop. life is good.
ToddFuhrman,ha wish it brought more folks together; main issue is guys in this space trying to social climb but hey i guess  that is  capitalism at its finest
ToddFuhrman,who thinks a team of 18 and 19 year olds will beat grown men? if a nfl team wanted to take it seriously theyd cover 30 by halftime
ToddFuhrman,if a receiver gives himself up believe the rule is the clock stops but would have to check the full rule book won't claim to be an expert
ToddFuhrman,while we love your passion for the brand jake neither  nor myself will ever ask that of our loyal listeners just keeping tuning in and spreading the gospel
ToddFuhrman,can't expect guys that haven't taken any live reps to come out clicking week 1 this is what happens when stars sit out the entire preseason necessary evil
ToddFuhrman,gl trying to charm your book on that front my friend. ticket not dead just a massive uphill battle for us now given this shocking turn of events
ToddFuhrman,the thunder won multiple titles with russ harden and kd. i can see why the rockets think harden and russ cant fail in a reunion tour. oh wait...
ToddFuhrman,youd think he has to have something lined up behind the scenes or further confirms that no amount of money is worth being a member of the kings
ToddFuhrman,thanks man and for as much as we give  a hard time for me personally not having a dog in the fight hopefully the raps pull it off
ToddFuhrman,theres not meeting them and getting to the super bowl (can live with it) then theres having a high win total and performing like the jaguars last year
ToddFuhrman,down the stretch they come:  breaks down every horse in the  exclusively for  and shares his thoughts on all the bets you need to make for derby day
ToddFuhrman,that is  the amount of money the casino theoretically keeps on each bet; the lower the hold  percent  on a given market the more advantageous for the player
TheCousinSal,congratulations to the college football playoff selection committee for not having to struggle with the decision to send an all around boring utah team to the playoffs. whew!
TheCousinSal,"football!!! 
is!!!! 
back!!!!

this week on #againstallodds the degenerate trifecta and i break down pitt/ne la/car nyg/boys + heisman picks greatest sports rivalries best bets and more. #gambling"
TheCousinSal,im hearing from people in the tv industry that jeopardy james lost. this would be big news if true. hang tight - ill try to get confirmation soon.
TheCousinSal,can we agree that this will be the worst bad beat of all-time 73 ots from now when this atrocity of a bowl game goes over the total?
TheCousinSal,i know im a year late with this but how is that aaron rodgers sucks and nick foles is the best 3rd and long qb in nfl history?
TheCousinSal,not sure if this was part of the bet - but getting to see tigers gigantic bald spot during the post-match handshake made the whole thing worthwhile. #thematch
TheCousinSal,you could give me 11 guesses and i still wouldnt be able to decisively tell you who is going to win the afc south or the nfc east.
TheCousinSal,i look forward to a time when i have to explain to my grandkids that this guy was the runaway mvp of the 2018 # college football nationalchampionship.
12Xpert,"you may also say there is intuition or as you put it ""gut feeling."" you still need to test it. if it stops working you won't know why."
12Xpert,ok looking forward to it but just as a rough ball-park figure what were you expecting to be able to deliver with this? as a win  percent ?
12Xpert,"i suitable opportunity to plug my book and  it is  chapter ""a market for lemons."" i'm guessing it might have partly been the inspiration for this betting article."
12Xpert,the history of political and economic forecasting is a litter basket of rolled dice. if course if you believe this best strategy is to massively short the pound.
12Xpert,but there is still plenty of soft book closing odds value so pinnacle opening late cannot be the only reason why they are more efficient than soft books.
12Xpert,the reason is that recreationals intentionally use inefficient odds to sell the message that they offer great odds then ban when a customer systematically tries to exploit them.
12Xpert,sorry i  daily fantasy sports  yet but i can check this. presumably you want to see how the bigger (more liquid) leagues compare to the smaller ones right?
JambosPicks,a busy sports day with mlb playoffs nfl # thursday night football  and ncaa football and we've got free picks! head to  to see our free thursday plays.
JambosPicks,"sure were pulling for #brewers-#cardinals to hit the over but well certainly give props for a great pitching performance. 

(ok now that hes out: score some runs yall!)"
JambosPicks,jambos subscribers watching the cardinals in the bottom of the 8th with the bases loaded and no outs only needing 2 runs to hit the over: #cubs #stlcards
mschwimer,i am assuming subs purchased pics from when we started selling. not arbitrarily picking what weeks to purchase. full record. not picking and choosing like terrible touts do.
mschwimer,i appreciate you listening with an open mind!  please listen at the 29:30 mark of the podcast for the exact reason we do not post estimates for bankroll.
mschwimer,"1. we do get clv. just not a lot. 
2. yes but in fair markets only. sports betting market not fair market because people cant bet unlimited amounts."
mschwimer,absolutely.  plus anyone can review our picks at anytime. we post all the necessary information so the twitter world can call us out if we make any mistakes!
RufusPeabody,the math doesn't agree. sorry! romo didn't win in a single one of the 320000 sims i ran. he wasn't even top 20 in any of them.
RufusPeabody,only sport i can see it being possible with is european soccer and you'd need to do it from someplace like the isle of mann or malta
jeffma,long awaited new episode of  where  discusses his costume changes at burning man and we address our take on this whole jambos lupe fiasco. cue up schwimmer
jeffma,appreciate it. my main point was you can second guess not making bets all the time. and i think doing so will drive you mad. so dont
SportsCheetah,eh closed 217 ill take 219.5 there every time. hard to win too many unders when seth curry drops 23 off of the bench in a half.
SportsCheetah,whether you think in n out is overrated or actually good etc. next time get your burger with just spread and chopped chilis and thank me later.
capjack2000,"""for every winning player you ban you have to ban a losing player who has lost at least the same amount that the winning player has won."""
capjack2000,"i think kambi is overmatched on us sports. their pregame and in-game model reflects that. kambi is much sharper on international sports imo. 

no inefficiency lasts forever."
capjack2000,there is no uncapped winners either. the market corrects itself to squeeze out the winners. the brokerages always win in the end because they charge the commission.
capjack2000,"i dont normally  things like this but:
1) $30k/pt is a crazy sweat.
2) check out the effect this had on their pointsbetting pricing for that game:"
capjack2000,"i feel like this is that scene in star wars where the little hologram of princess lea is saying ""help me obi-wan kenobi you're my only hope..."""
capjack2000,"who was your source dustin? 

i dont think you made it up. i think you were puppeted for at best negotiation - or at worst market manipulation."
capjack2000,"if a casino run by the legendary joe lupo cant get sportsbetting right we might as well not even try to make this work. 

am i right"
capjack2000,it looks like books are listening to the players and offering competitive futures markets.  offering a two-sided market on the nfc east. looks like $2k limits too.
capjack2000,i  daily fantasy sports  think wh really wants the task of opening/converting 30 new shops in 6 months. i think that press release was a leverage play.
capjack2000,i do. i also hope the operator tries to find a better approach that is fair to all involved. maybe with greater liquidity will come greater tolerance.
capjack2000,the geographic footprint of caesars and eldorado make a merger viable. very little overlap in their jurisdictions. that said eldorado will definitely want to trim some properties.
capjack2000,to celebrate sports betting independence day i sat down with whale and andy and talked about where weve been and where were headed in the legalized markets.
capjack2000,i do. although it sounds like co shouldnt need to fleece the consumers to be profitable. glad to see he voiced the opinion of the people though.
capjack2000,i'm elbow deep in mlb derivative betting this morning yet i'm sitting here transfixed by the discussion on #anumbersgame by  and  about their ancestry. good job guys.
capjack2000,i noticed that  is coming up on outside the lines on espn2 (1pm et). hopefully to shed some light on this mlb lineup issue. tuning in now.
capjack2000,much more devastating in a locals market like pennsylvania where $200m is lost each month in machines (they  daily fantasy sports  break it down to slot denominations).
dinkinc,if you are a successful owner/trainer why would you want to change to synthetics ??   oh right....to help the horses ... the ones you say you love
dinkinc,i think bookmakers would like to put an end to exhibition football more than anyone else .. i am sure some of my friends are killing it
dinkinc,tough crowd.  i agree on the guns ... abortion to me is a tough one as i can see both sides.  abortion for rape victims for sure.
dinkinc,no... you are wrong... he admires him....he has no tact or secret agendas he wishes he can be the type of man he is.... same with putin....
dinkinc,1-1 mlb with a push............  2-2 horse  props ..... 0-1 nhl..... we are on the precipice of a slump... horses want a bail [of hay} out tomorrow
robpizzola,so logically when theres this big interior rush... either start running some screens or getting cousins out of the pocket. the offense is so vanilla and predictable.
robpizzola,remind you that i made a joke it got 'd by some falcons fan and now the entire fan base thinks i have something against matt ryan?
robpizzola,ravens receivers are running wide open everywhere but lamars throws have absolutely been on point. all three  touchdown s hit his wide receivers perfectly in stride. impressive.
robpizzola,hes 28 percent  owned which is around what i expected and one of the main reasons that i avoided him. sometimes it works out sometimes it doesnt.
robpizzola,likely going to do a nhl playoffs periscope at some point tomorrow night (probably around 7:00). i'll also post my series win probabilities after i bet them.
RASPicks,only buy points when its the right thing to do on its own such as on/off 3 or 7 for 10 cents but few offer that anymore.
RASPicks,college football  season recap:  49-40 +6.00 units 55.06 percent  beat close by 1.96 points per pick on average.  second half plays 5-2.   college basketball  in 15 days.
ProfessorShine,their goal is get as much cash as possible in any way possible.  espn endorsing this guy tells you what an irresponsible money grab this actually is.
ProfessorShine,i dont want him either but 33 percent  in playoffs is good. reggie miller career playoff avg is 32 percent . kobe bryant is 29 percent .
ProfessorShine,tearing down everyone is a large generalization.  there is a problem in this industry and i will comment on it.  if no like slide down to unfollow.
suuma810,the seahawks gave up 154 rushing yards on  sunday night football  vs kansas city. 8.1 ypc. the type of run defense that can cut a january short?
suuma810,you do this by being efficient overall not by forcing runs. and at the end you always have the same amount of drives than your opponent (+-).
suuma810,wrong team was favored in the cin/ind game. grabbed bengals +3 early enough to collect decent +clv. bengals d had issues but offense took care of business.
ClevTA,of course not. im saying a bad negative outcome can only hurt you but good performance cant help. the old nothing to gain but everything to lose
ClevTA,remember this is your lineup and u got here on your own so u do whatever u think is best. dont let me make decisions for u
ClevTA,im not disagreeing that chubb can do well i was disagreeing with your assertion that trying to get him the rushing title was the reason is all
ClevTA,if one team beats an ever so slightly worse schedule by an avg of 14 more points per gm than the other who has a better resume?
ClevTA,osu is one of the best teams of all time according to multiple advanced statistics. not sure citing fpi is where u want to focus for lsu
ClevTA,not a disrespect thing just an observation. i dont watch a lot but maybe the steelers +3 and bills +2.5 as gifts against the browns stand out.
ClevTA,wait 1-8 northwestern is favored by 40.5? has there been a worse team ever favored by 40+? can we get a podcast just on this gm alone?
ClevTA,how do u know he wanted the job?  maybe they called and he turned them down? i know ppl who were convinced he was getting the job
ClevTA,i tend to agree with the allen comment. going from noodlearm cam to a qb who can potentially get it downfield cant possibly be such a downgrade
ClevTA,they just missed the cut. i was nervous bc they were using their 3rd string lt in seattle with the noise. trust me i was kicking myself
ClevTA,usually only do this for xmas nba but about to create a 20 man draftkings double up. $20. winner takes all. if u want in dm me
CizzlingSports,"1. not sure i'd ever go with ""danny kanell agrees with me"" but ymmv

2. he gets to ""stay home[?]""

drag him 

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"seems like # worst of all time  was gonna try to add a free with on uf to his  college football  record lol

 i do not know"
CizzlingSports,"lmao

so  has given out 3 moar blood bank winners to the plebes than to his subscribers?

and oh wow shock-stun he's shorting himself 1 looser

ok"
CizzlingSports,".nothing about this response makes sense.

unless the goal is preserving the ability to later freeroll on the ""regular' wagers oh wait

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,seems lyke ppl with +ev nfl betting information might be too busy on sun mornings to host negative expected value betting shows but  i do not know
spanky,"good opportunity for anyone interested.  

i am also hiring.  

only requirement for me is if youre cool to hang out with. 
well figure out the rest eventually."
spanky,damn.  ive received many offers to work for free. whats better than an employee paying an employer to work!  i love +ev. send your resume to  .
spanky,i dont sell. i extract money from bookmakers not my fellow bettors. without betting partners id be out of business. very few bookmakers worldwide book me directly
spanky,dont mess with   him and his crew are the gambling twitter police.  if you fall outta line they pounce on you like hyenas on a fresh carcass.
spanky,youre the best vinnie.  i still owe you a few rounds next time im in town. your generosity (especially at the bar) is unparalleled.  class act brother.
spanky,accurate market anticipation is a very undervalued skill that takes years to grasp....knowing not just what to bet but when to bet can make a big difference...
spanky,actually wynn comes up first a lot. of course once  hangs their numbers up wynn takes theirs down in a panic to reopen them to the  number.
spanky,donbest being down is equivalent to being locked in disney world with no one in the park and going on space mountain 20 times in a row
spanky,odds of hitting mega millions: 259 million to 1...current payout is 900 million for a $2 ticket or 450 million to 1.. are we in positive ev???
spanky,great point  .  the best sports bettors in the world are the ones the industry insiders are aware of and the ones the masses never hear about
PlusEVAnalytics,what the fuck  so if i take bets in the back room of my pool hall but the pool hall is my core business its all good?
PlusEVAnalytics,im not a socialist but this is lunacy. and its not the fault of governments or greedy ceos. its us the market. we value businesses this way.
PlusEVAnalytics,thats a massive oversimplification mr lucky. its about information asymmetry. market it like you can win and then ban anyone who actually can. its probabilistic false advertising.
PlusEVAnalytics,can you please  take some of the take from your newly juiced up prop lines and put it into a mobile app or something. this is madness.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes thats important. also the derivative of the teams performance with respect to their best players availability (more steep for the chiefs less steep for the saints)
PlusEVAnalytics,i think if you assumed 29 of them were independent and the 30th was completely dependent that wouldnt be perfect but it should be in the ballpark.
PlusEVAnalytics,in a well designed game 7-7-blank should appear more frequently than blank-7-7. its not impossible to do this with uniformly distributed independent reels but its certainly tougher...
aluckyaday,any information on how he is planning on solving the 2 big issues with exchanges? liquidity and the fact that recreational punters  daily fantasy sports  like/understand them?
aluckyaday,the trap many fall in to assuming because they are winning they are doing the right thing. see how it looks after thousands of bets not 10s!
aluckyaday,why would they. you give them 2k and they give you the ability to make an unlimited amount. as i said they know what they are doing.
aluckyaday,so your issue is with representative democracy itself not the eu? unfortunately the people who you say know best elected those elitist politicians in the first place!
aluckyaday,a market implies trading. in a betting market a trade is done by one party backing and one party laying the same outcome at an agreed price.
aluckyaday,there is some excellent literature on the subject by joseph buchdahl  he used to run a proofing service for touts and wrote a book about the subject.
aluckyaday,maybe i'm in cloud cuckoo land but i think market efficiency is over egged. i believe books will try and target public biases as much as sharps.
joeyisaks,ya shared accounts u can just tell groups to end in 9 other in 8 etc but thats just obv whats goin on when u do that
joeyisaks,good luck to the riders and horses! and to  on his picks! hope no luck to the will not be named dodgers outfielder sitting next to him
joeyisaks,ed said you would be better off actually betting it was clear what he said and its clear from this you dont know the betting market much
EdMillerPoker,i mean i feel like i have a lot of evidence to back my viewpoint but obv can be wrong  daily fantasy sports  have a crystal ball.
EdMillerPoker,the pool is way too shallow in nearly all gambling  disciplines (poker being an exception) to sustainably teach others to grind real stuff in bulk open-to-the-public workshops
EdMillerPoker,"we show two different totals one ""main"" and one ""alternate"". we always show the  percent  chance in terms of the  percent  of going over just by convention"
EdMillerPoker,it is  great for bettors but this is also the perfect book for anyone who works in or near sports to understand much better how it works.
EdMillerPoker,never ever safe to separate words from actions. words are how ppl create reputation and trust that can then be abused later with actions. rinse and repeat.
EdMillerPoker,my favorite thing by far about twitter is how domain experts have conversations on the platform that otherwise would be private but instead are archived and semi-public
EdMillerPoker,bitching about songbirds in spring is a core twitter use case and is also just about all you need to know about how things work around here
EdMillerPoker,i understand this and its so deeply rooted in the euro approach that i think theyll be slow to adapt and that will be what provides opportunity
GolcondaFund,"lol i feel ya.

i'm just promoting plant based .. fixed all my stomach issues .. esoecially cuz i'd eat steak for break lunch and dinner lol"
nonrandomalpha,bears fans after mitch beats a 6th round backup an undrafted rookie qb a rookie qb and a team on the verge of firing their head coach...
nonrandomalpha,sheesh squeak out a couple shit wins v beat up shit teams and all of a sudden the moxie is back for some delusional bears fans. pathetic.
nonrandomalpha,insight into the redskins interim head coachs football philosophy; appears to want to prioritize the run game...even in spite of having one of the leagues worst ols.
LeeSharpeNFL,"lol and the lions manage to match a field goal before the half ends to make it 17-3 lions.

just unlucky nothing the packers good have done."
LeeSharpeNFL,franchises  daily fantasy sports  like the image of qb controversy they think it makes them look weak if there's not a clear guy. but  it is  smart.
LeeSharpeNFL,"playing around with cpoe a bit.

x-axis = cpoe when target is *behind* line to gain

y-axis = cpoe when target is *ahead* of line to gain"
LeeSharpeNFL,if you think the seahawks need to shake things i'm i'd be down for a qb trade. please focus on last night's game when evaluating your decision.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i never understand whether these ""qb is worth to the spread"" stats are being made about that team's actual backup or against a replacement qb or what."
LeeSharpeNFL,"an amazing quadrant in the upper left consisting of:

- team with current #1 draft pick
- team with current #2 draft pick
- carolina christian mccafferies"
whale_capper,this seems like an attempt to save face but regardless at this point if youre still a knicks fan you have no one to blame but yourself
whale_capper,to honor the 10- year anniversary of taking rubio and flynn b2b over steph... the twolves traded up then tried to trade down before settling on culver
whale_capper,jazz net rating is a bit inflated by a super soft late season schedule in my opinion but conley is 1.5 to 2x rubio in that system
whale_capper,stay dry pat very much appreciate the note (this makes my want to fade bellafina like crazy with the added potential for a pace mel touchdown own)
AndyMSFW,i have az +10 a 10 point lead 12 minutes left and i still  daily fantasy sports  feel that great about brett hundley bringing this thing home.
AndyMSFW,working on it!  but really depending on your numbers any combo of buf no lac and maybe arz if  it is  gonna go back to +2.5 anyways.
AndyMSFW,we brought this up on the podcast but if you're unfamiliar and bored this is worth a watch.  (this is where the bears/raiders game is being played)
AndyMSFW,i tried to listen to a podcast about golf betting this morning but there was a ton of spicy language from the older asian gentleman this week.
JoeyKnish22,"more details to come. can download app here: 

app is real sleek. should be pretty sweet and fun way to live bet during the national title game."
JoeyKnish22,this was mostly a sarcastic dig at  hoping hed see it. i dont hate everyone from minnesota i do hate the rest of the things i mentioned.
JoeyKnish22,there isnt one. winning is hard straight up. this is playing keno. occasionally ppl win the vast majority lose. they want you to think you can win.
JoeyKnish22,patriots injury list with this schedule gonna be so long they might tack on the asian hooker who got the flu from kraft this week as (doubtful)
JoeyKnish22,"hard to recover from that sequence. redzone turnover. free set of downs.  touchdown . 

annoying football cliche but you dont beat elite teams doing that dumb shit."
JoeyKnish22,thats how generic 2-3 star recruit x becomes all conference player time after time after time then turns into  in the nfl where more rigorous testing exist.
JoeyKnish22,well bear if i watch 5 more minutes of this michigan game i might light my house on fire (with me in it) so wake/fsu it is.
JoeyKnish22,anthony russo passing yardage prop anywhere from 258-262 at a number of shops. i played under as even a couple series for centeio throws him off pace.
JoeyKnish22,the new stuff in jersey is exponentially better. the westgate miomni one is actually pretty solid but i cant believe how bad a couple of these are.
JoeyKnish22,youll be paying for it this weekend when i start screaming at the counter and recording a spanky video because you didnt give me enough drink tickets.
JoeyKnish22,used to work in hr-recruiting right out of college. hundreds of interviews still have ptsd from all the the dumb shit and awkward situations i sat through.
JoeyKnish22,morey really lost it man. knew he was on the chopping block pulled a yolo. wont be around to deal with the consequences when it fails anyway.
TheKostos,capped tonight's nba card and have a few plays that stand out. great college slate tonight too. gonna have fun breaking it down 6pm et  with  and
TheKostos,i legit  daily fantasy sports ! i love bachelor in paradise but the bachelor/bachelorette are terrible outside of the very beginning/very end and chris harrison's tell-all specials
TheKostos,pete is the absolute best. gets a bad rap by fools on this app but he couldnt be a nicer dude and this should serve as proof
TheKostos,damien not winning mvp in 54 is like james white not winning for 51 or justin tuck not winning for 42 (did i say that out loud?)
TheKostos,i'm 36 years old and the giants are my favorite out of the teams i grew up rooting for. who would you rather it be? charles stackhouse?
LockyLockerson,. we could spend the entire 4 hours monday just talking about the cfp ramifications of today.  there are so many dicey scenarios now on the board.
LockyLockerson,a lot of offshores are open for business and we are starting to get a nice little college hoops betting market going.   it is  been too long.
LockyLockerson,"it is  that time again...widely-available  college football  things i bet for saturday.

part 1:
12p utah state +27.5
12p army +2.5
12p michigan -4
12p kansas +33"
LockyLockerson,"we're talking bout

touting..
then jambo shouting

we're talkin bout
replying 
denying
subscribing
conspiring
conniving
sec filings

and i got ta sayyyyyy

ooooooooooooo weeeeeeee

*leaves computer laughing*"
LockyLockerson,jordan bell running onto the court to make a basket with his arms for that desperation heave may be my favorite part of the game so far
EliHershkovich,caught up on harvard-maryland. cowan is so much stronger than last season  terps are filled with floor-spacing + smith. can't wait to watch that dude in march.
EliHershkovich,we'll take a 2-1 day 30-16 overall (+11.98 units). surprised how passive marshall was over the final 30 minutes. scruggs got a helluva look for the tie.
DannyParkins,james went to u of i and is from naperville and will be on  tomorrow at 3:00 telling us his incredible story and battling  in sports trivia.
DannyParkins,no i didn't i said they've had the joe ricketts addison russell and sinclair stories all in a row..  daily fantasy sports  say things that arent true
chadmillman,"at this point my daily routine is: 
1. wake up.
2. get abused mentally by kids.
3. check  app to see/read what  and  are planning.
4. act"
chadmillman,i mentioned on  that saints pass d vs rbs is a reason why i bet the giants +3.5. more details than i can fit on tv here.
Gingfacekillah,start with wayne winston's excel course.  it is  very beginner friendly imo. the others are more involved but i'd still encourage you to give it a shot.
Gingfacekillah,working on an article for  hopefully it will walk readers through a domain knowledge related troubleshooting process i've found helpful. should be finished in a few days.
Gingfacekillah,the links work. please make sure theyre entered in your browser correctly. ill send you a dm to see if i can resolve the issue youre having.
Gingfacekillah,data science msc week one. there is nothing more humbling than the bottom of a learning curve. so much i dont know but excited to dig in.
Gingfacekillah,box score results. my player based model has no answers for the og recorded in this game. back to the drawing board. have to think about this.
logan_matthews9,to be profitable your subscriber would have had to bet $28200 last week and they won $141. id say almost all of your subscribers lost last week
logan_matthews9,"how come its only ever the other teams b squad? 

its just such a usmnt-fan thing to do: berhalter has won every competitive game and still complaining"
logan_matthews9,to somewhat play devils advocate here - assuming we get france durkin isnt the holding mid you want and mendez is a luxury player we cant afford
logan_matthews9,"called that no/chi line yesterday - got it at 234 tipped off at 228 actual total may not hit 200. thats a four unit win!!
#nbagambling #nbapicks"
logan_matthews9,it is a bit counter intuitive since we are basically doubling down on square lines but im seeing such huge gaps in my prediction vs the line
PikachuBets,never been so happy to look at the board and only see 10 games for tmrw. freedom is nice this must be how the founding fathers felt
PikachuBets,wow what a trash book this is doesn't even have a memphis rsw 29 line smh how do you expect to compete with the others that do
PikachuBets,from what i saw it went 2-4  i do not know  about units  daily fantasy sports  care to track. like clockwork! so predictable it fucking hurts lol
PikachuBets,got invited on  to talk about small markets  other stuff that may or may not be interesting. thanks for having me   hope all y'all enjoy my stuttering
PikachuBets,"these products...help keep espn at the cutting edge of sports statistical analysis.

lmao espn and cutting edge dont go together when theyre still touting trend statistics loooool"
adamchernoff,nice saw one of those the other day at the bbq store. you have the vertical one? any particular woods or sauces you find better than others?

Ccon8181,lol rivers ...  didnt learn my lesson backing them verse chiefs in mexico city. you actually have to laugh at the ways hes able to implode #minvslac
Ccon8181,i do.. otherwise i wouldnt put my $ behind it.. hope it doesnt turn out to be like the over in dallas pats a few weeks ago
Ccon8181,nothing tonight... slight lean to the under but the value is gone so have to pass. no edge. best of luck if you bet on the game
Ccon8181,i knew going in qb robinson was garbage but making #ttu defense look like the 72 bears is a disgrace. blown coverages turnovers. hope #tcu loses outright
Ccon8181,yea theyll cover as soon as everyone else is on them and i jump ship haha. thanks and all the best to you this season as well.
Ccon8181,$3 and $500 dollars? is this to start out and eventually grow limits from there? i like the idea but those are some tight limits on sides
Ccon8181,#blazers playing like its first time on court. in a must win 0 energy or offense flow. tired of #lillard saying he gets no respect. earn it
Ccon8181,#niners are the right side but can't take this bad of a number. worse i could take is 13. will wait for possible value 2nd half #nevssf
Ccon8181,right!! was that not a complete mel touchdown own or what.  what the fuck  was gtown doing? all they had to do was exchange free throws lol
Ccon8181,the fund is not taking time off. only one investment so far.  it is  not about action  it is  about returns. investing in only the strongest sides
ToddFuhrman,let us  talk turkey andy...what's the read on the big game weds? that means a lot more than my feelings on the pack team right now ha
ToddFuhrman,thanks craig always love talking football with the guys segment flies by and never a chance to really deep dive a lot of the stuff we discuss
ToddFuhrman,lot of questions regarding durability with that entire group...great on paper but  let us  see if they can all be healthy and active at the same time
ToddFuhrman,yep and  it is  one of the things  that is  always driven me nuts when parsing out true rushing stats; should be treated like the nfl imo
ToddFuhrman,if any of the jewelry circulating on the miami sidelines disappears during the course of the regular season does that constitute paying players? asking for a friend...
ToddFuhrman,payne...you're a huge x's and o's guy who would be your top choice (money and current affiliation not withstanding) to run the program in the beilein mold?
ToddFuhrman,after watching the nuggets earlier and the raptors right now you get an increased appreciation of how effortless the dynasty in golden st makes closeout situations look
ToddFuhrman,run for the roses: our  horse whisperer  is back with a complete field breakdown and everything you need to know to make cash on the #kentuckyderby tomorrow
ToddFuhrman,"closing consensus line on the #nationalchampionship 

texas tech 119.5
virginia -2

betting public damn near split on points and moneyline with a slight tech lean at 55/45"
ToddFuhrman,hope im wrong (happens plenty) but would love to see a great finals however fear is that whatever team emerges from the east could already be spent
TheCousinSal,and i had the pleasure of shooting a comedy bit today with hue - who is for my money the most talented member of the jackson family.
TheCousinSal,as we anxiously wait to see who will select best of luck bol in this years draft lets pay tribute to his late father manute...a fascinating specimen.
TheCousinSal,i chatted with my pal and fantasy football guru  at the  in fort worth and  somehow figured out a way to record the whole thing. genius!    #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,btw - nice job by brother bri. his best bet last wednesday was wiscy (+6.5) which drove the line all the way down to 3.5.  #againstallodds #sharptank
TheCousinSal,guys - we made it to big time grownup television.  super bowl special airs today on  live at 3:30 pm et. cant wait to screw this up.
12Xpert,salazar has just been banned following an extensive investigation into all these things prompted by whistleblower athletes who spilled the beans. what more proof do you want?
12Xpert,i'd still say that on the basis of the data i looked at here tennis is still pretty darn efficient just perhaps not as efficient as soccer.
12Xpert,jesus then  it is  even worse since you obviously can't see they are taking you for a fool. or maybe they are clueless about this topic too
JambosPicks,it was a risk fading patrick corbin and the red-hot #nats but the #orioles pull off the upset and get jambos subscribers a with on the ml!
mschwimer,you are correct in that we could say that. however if you listen to the podcast starting at the 29:30 mark you will hear why we dont.
mschwimer,we post every week. good or bad. just so happens all 3 weeks have been good. but we continue to post everything. the good and the bad.
mschwimer,only one comment. i would love to come on bet the process to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you said is entirely incorrect.
mschwimer,based on your comments i assume you will be signing up. am i correct? or are you another twitter troll that doesnt back up anything they say?
mschwimer,helps! blas mission has always been to improve the conditions for minor league players. anything  does to help with that is a big plus in my book.
mschwimer,dont be scared. iv been to 5 gmen games including 2007 nfc championship in green bay. giants r 5-0 when i am there and i will be
mschwimer,for all of u who asked me how embarrassing it is to carry the pink hello kitty backpack my response is i love every second of it!
mschwimer,made a deal with d. brown. if i get 10k followers by sep 1st then he will join twitter.  the ball is in your court phillies phans!
mschwimer,thanks for the q and a... its time to go to the best bbq in the world according to the food network... dinos bbq in rochester ny
RufusPeabody,how many do they say they have? thousands. how many paid subscribers? probably a few dozen hoping to get their $10k in a few weeks time
RufusPeabody,i also said that i have no idea what criteria goes into winning the heisman and how much it matters if you're on a great team.
RufusPeabody,right hes saying youre touting your record on free prop picks you give on a podcast when they do well but not when they do poorly.
RufusPeabody,this is a regulation billy. i lived in vegas for many years and i'm sure any of the bookmaker/industry people out there will back that up.
RufusPeabody,retirement sounds so boring. ive hit that point but when what i do for fun is also what i do for a living why would i?
RufusPeabody,"looked up a few i thought might be contenders:
davis love 2015 wyndham: 912/1
charlie beljan 2013 northern trust: 969/1
padraig harrington 2015 honda classic: 724/1"
RufusPeabody,i meant in terms of the big game management decisions. he made all the right calls going for it on 4th downs and going for two.
RufusPeabody,ask any  daily fantasy sports  player. there are  daily fantasy sports  groups that are doing this every week. they are just not as obvious about it.
jeffma,we have had offers but have turned them all down... we're waiting for the right partnership that will help improve our content and grow our reach
SportsCheetah,i didn't have any action on either side until i took that live shot at the end but that entire 4q the officiating extremely benefited denver.
SportsCheetah,easy to say after 2 ints but wasnt devlin noticeably better then rudolph? strange move back other than trying to save face on a draft pick.
SportsCheetah,i thought he was referring to the availability of the number but it appears he is just an arky fan laughing at how bad they've been/are.
capjack2000,. is so poorly run that their online casino grosses more revenue than the retail casino. doesn't surprise me at all they'd be this tone deaf.

capjack2000,they  daily fantasy sports  offer -2 (or -1 or -3) anywhere. i doubt this is second-level thinking to deter bots. this is just clumsy backend software.
capjack2000,i guess we're minutes away from someone editing that video to show sam's eyes darting around to ghosts in the frame much like the gase/taco video.
capjack2000,"depends on the state. not many states have online casinos. nj pa de. 

there is a decided culture gap between american and european models there too."
capjack2000,"lets check out futures. they are big money makers for any book. 

looks like they only offer super bowl futures in nfl. 

the commas are cute."
capjack2000,"also - decent early look at these lines done by  and  on the latest behind the bets podcast: 



do your own homework and shop for value."
capjack2000,this one is a few years old...i had bet that the first pitch of the game (world series) by jake arrieta would be a ball +120.
dinkinc,"if you are looking for my radio/video stint go to ... replays.... "" my guys in the desert "" 11/5...... begins at the 45 minute mark"
dinkinc,one of my favorite meals of my life actually probably one of my top two was lunch with kikutaro chris hero and kairi sane.. insanely cool...
dinkinc,to all the people who told me to stop tweeting about donald trump but tweet about high takeouts at the racetrack.  fu  get your priorities straight.
dinkinc,so does leaving.... i will miss your posts especially those of you and isispuppy... in a weird way i do get to see you every week
dinkinc,a trumper complaining about a persons ego.  she has to make 2000 tweets saying shes the best soccer player ever before you can bring this up
dinkinc,they have the best line in hockey and are likely the fastest team overall.  he has been great but he is a piece of the puzzle.
robpizzola,one night later. maybe the laughter did them some good? maybe it didnt? maybe it doesnt matter whatsoever? maybe we can stop with the dumb narratives.
robpizzola,first time seeing gojira live and they were absolutely . ive never seen a crowd that fired up for an opening band. amazing atmosphere at  tonight.
robpizzola,if they are going to be valued as a top five team in the league i think they're probably the biggest fade in the entire league.
robpizzola,it is not a typo but also very misleading. yes they dominated play but also took a lot of low-danger shots from all over the ice.
RASPicks,if in theory someone had a proven winning system they're not sharing it publicly. and if they did it wouldn't last. so the answer is 'no.'
RASPicks,5-4 is 55.5 percent  and is nothing to scoff at.  i'd be very happy (and rich) if i could sustain that for the next 10-20 years.
VegasRefund,"vr's 2019 bracket:

*this does not imply any actual bets i will be making. very well could be making bets opposite to picks in this bracket."
VegasRefund,"nfl: 8-0 | +8u

bears +3 
browns +1 
ravens +7 
49ers +3.5 
packers -3.5 
dolphins +10 
raiders +10.5 

fun day. hope yall did well"
VegasRefund,"which mainstream nfl pregame show do you watch?

everyones going to bash watching pregame shows but i watch nfl net every sunday cuz football is football."
VegasRefund,dolphins opened at -1.5 before last night.. think its peaked at +3 and has a better chance of coming down to +2/+2.5 than going to +3.5.
ProfessorShine,"the ""iggy is hof"" is comical.  but if it were up to me i'd hurl 25 percent  of inductee busts in all sports into the woods."
ProfessorShine,semi-anonymity is due to betting limits and profiling. ive never used it to do baseless attacks.   my issues with tan are fair. maybe address the issues?
suuma810,i'm not saying they are world-beaters. but they were an 8-8 team are better on paper this year and won't face andrew luck (0-2 last year).
suuma810,i dont think he is. 34 years old recent injury history and he has been one of the worst starting qbs over the past few years.
suuma810,cowboys on the red zone possession: run-first team and on 1st  goal - when they also could burn the clock - they decide to pass twice.
suuma810,the fact that they opened the line without a confirmation tells me that they dont expect a big difference between the two in the market reactions.
suuma810,i think #giants  dave gettleman are playing chess. took a rb so they can grab a qb at #1 in 2019 after missing out on baker.

ClevTA,4th and 4 from the 39 with a chance to end the game and day decided to punt. i just cant get over that. fucking sucks
ClevTA,im so confused by u. i said its a neutral court v la. neither team has advantage. what in the world are u arguing right now
ClevTA,u know whats more deflating? losing bc u miss a 2 point conversion and have no time left to get the ball back. but oh well
ClevTA,and what happens when u wait and miss the 2 with 5 seconds left? then what? thats what youd rather have? why? makes absolutely zero sense
ClevTA,17-39 (43.6 percent ) for 146 yds (3.7 yds/att) 6 sacks. i  daily fantasy sports  see the josh allen lovers this week for some reason. strange
ClevTA,was just thinking this. i guess he has an excuse with all that travel. pretty sure i saw him on the buckeyes sideline last night too
ClevTA,oh freddie. go ahead and bank on 63 yard  field goal s to score 2x at the end of a half. see how that works out
ClevTA,its so hard bc williams is coming back. mccoy wouldve had a great matchup otherwise. go jones just bc his volume is guaranteed without j williams
ClevTA,this is not a referendum on baker. two things can be true he can have a great future and also have struggled the first 2 gms
ClevTA,u could find much worse backup qbs than simien. if the browns were consensus -2.5 before the darnold news i would personally price this around -4/4.5
ClevTA,i heard dan starting to say happy birthday and thought torey was going to get her due then it turned out it was for beyonc instead
CizzlingSports,".upd8d   college football  betting records.

not much improvement here lol.

cc:    

note: these are only the plays clay sells on sun nights to his $99/year subs"
CizzlingSports,yeah but does it amplify the analysis if one of the entertainers also has a side hustle selling losing picks to suckers?  i do not know
CizzlingSports,this is both preposterous and incredible from  but  daily fantasy sports  let it distract from the fact that  also did a fantastic job covering the merits.
CizzlingSports,mark given  three-year record of selling  college football  plays (see below; he buried his followers) any idea why a non-casino/sportsbook would hire him for gambooling content?
spanky,im having a good time doing these podcasts.  i hope they are as fun for you to listen to as they are for me to record....
spanky,hey  i used to watch you on proline with jim feist on saturday mornings when i was a kid... you keep going like the energizer bunny.
spanky,delayed confirmation is a huge problem that is being abused. dont know if it can be proven but i would love gaming enforcement to get involved.
spanky,yeah it was nice to see that sharp slot group come along and put a dent in them last couple of months.  hopefully they strike again!
spanky,i've gone through about 10 beards with 5 dimes and have been booted every time.  that being said i was pain in full every single time.
spanky,easier said than done. i spent the  better part of the last 18 years sitting in a chair 100 hours a week.  appreciate the advice though.
spanky,what i love about living in nj/ny is the specific food that is hard to find anywhere else. hot pastrami on rye with a square kinish
spanky,not having a limits sheet is ridiculous. its equivalent to sitting at a table game in a casino without a sign of minutes and max bet.
spanky,nhl for me is the hardest of the us sports to beat. i know a few cats out there that do well. kudos to them.  specialty
spanky,you're right. i'm just a random twitter dude like  .  maybe one of the following could convince you i have some idea of what i'm doing:
spanky,lmao. im not a tout. ive never sold a pick ever.  ive probably bet more last weekend than youll make your entire life!  be easy kiddo...
DocBettor,how can i go back to watching games when all broadcasts (even on regular old tv) are slower than this youwager live betting summary view #gamblingtwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,i mean yeah but before we even try to estimate these things ourselves we should figure out if the market already does it perfectly or not.
PlusEVAnalytics,"we won't go 'til we get some
we won't go 'til we get some
we won't go until we get some
so bring it out here!"
PlusEVAnalytics,cool article but only tells half the story. a (skilled) gambler might make an excellent actuary. textbook concepts jump to life when used in real-world applications.
PlusEVAnalytics,remember the gwb administration when we made up words like truthiness and we laughed and laughed about these politicians outright rejection of reality? that was cute.
PlusEVAnalytics,in play metrics like yards gained are at best a less noisy proxy for actual results. i wouldnt look at it as a substitute for clv.
PlusEVAnalytics,no. next season as in 2020 if 2019 results are good. if 2019 results are bad we forget this conversation ever happened. thats how this works.
PlusEVAnalytics,next year they should pick mlbs surliest ump (measured by # of ejections) and get him to wave off  hours if the pitcher goes too early
PlusEVAnalytics,its all about information asymmetry. buyers dont know which sellers are legit winners so they shouldnt buy. if nobody buys then theres no point in selling.
PlusEVAnalytics,a parameter that you would fit from the data. probably in the range [01] although you could talk me into the possibility of it being negative.
PlusEVAnalytics,by that logic each of the 64 has a better chance to win under match play because they each only have to beat 6 guys. impossible.
PlusEVAnalytics,i cant imagine a more revolting thing to interview players about than their involvement in meaningless plays from years ago that resulted in gambling bad beats...
PlusEVAnalytics,whats the point of negative uncorrelated returns? just keep cash its zero and uncorrelated. any inflationary risk of cash also exists in usd denominated sports bets.
aluckyaday,almost done. 2-2. season now 30-27-3 (started week 2)  52.63 percent . infinite tipping monkeys would have this record or better 34.92 percent  of the time.
aluckyaday,move your operation to the uk no taxes on gambling winningsseriously though how do the irs verify your profits? do they just have to trust you?
aluckyaday,not around in the morning so turning back time and putting the selection up the night before. bettor prices than quoted are available but without bog.
aluckyaday,there are usually two route to getting educated. either you are intelligent or you have rich parents. unfortunately politicians quite often come from the second group!
aluckyaday,i guess it also depends how biased the public money is. is it big enough in one direction to offset the sharp money on the other.
aluckyaday,ok i'll continue to try and educate you. how do you set you stake at the moment? do you use a bank? do you use kelly?
aluckyaday,would be interesting to here what  thinks of your big 6 methodology. data mining which should regress? or deliberate bookmaker inefficiencies where square money outweighs sharp?
aluckyaday,what happens if you change the assumptions about margin distribution? if you put the margin all on one side do you still get the tiny probabilities?

joeytunes2,do you? pros? without money management  your no pro.  it is  the most important thing. if you dont have proper money management. you just a degenerate.
joeytunes2,well yes one place of course. not the market. and you guys are actual a real book.  begged for wash money and series money game 1.
joeytunes2,anyone want to bet me anything? tike to get through to american airlines? how long my phone battery will last? what will happen with latte larry's?
joeyisaks,"if you are above the age of 26... and putting yourself in remotely a position to go ""broke"" its time to probably quit betting in general."
joeyisaks,stock market so good today even $nbrv is up today. bought some starbucks stock other day those egg white poppers alone should carry it above 100
joeyisaks,was there last night too too bad we didnt run into each other z! its great - think its on netflix can just watch there too
joeyisaks,i lost multiple accounts today all 1bv skin.. wasnt using a bot on any and got this text each time.. did they do a sweep today?
joeyisaks,every us open he serves bigger by 5+ miles per hour  juicing cycle? no one in draw left can win more than a set vs rafa
joeyisaks,i love aria for barber services!! i got a shave their last xmas actually and loved the guy who did it. we talked nba entire time
EdMillerPoker,tho i had just managed to forget that guy exists and now twitter will be injecting him into my tl for the next decade i estimate
EdMillerPoker,"be wary of someone trying to make a name for themselves by tearing down the work of someone more famous

when its someone less famous run"
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  find the first sentence game-breaking in the slightest  for what  it is  worth . esp because like two months later they added csvs.
EdMillerPoker,incidentally if/when most volume moves to in-play this will be a much harder determination esp for anyone who is conscious to avoid certain tell betting behaviors
EdMillerPoker,my only thought is for that guy's sake i hope auburn wins. ( for what  it is  worth  i think you're just seeing them reported more)
EdMillerPoker,tbh i think we are substantially better in all three areas at the moment. gamestate errors are all over the current feeds. so are modeling errors.
EdMillerPoker,have a lot of respect for anyone trying to start a sports betting-related business now. anyone trying to start a business is taking a major risk.
EdMillerPoker,a hi percentage so far of discussion around sports betting in the us implicitly assumes the avg bettor is a helpless degenerate  it is  v dumb
EdMillerPoker,quote  is a . its the primary way to signal boost on the platform. dont quote  garbage just to argue with it or dunk on it.
EdMillerPoker,"first visit to las vegas 20 years ago fell in love with how anyone can make it here with their brain and some hustle.

still true."
EdMillerPoker,the underlying assets in financial markets taken together have enormous economic value. and diverse entities and stakeholders participate in those markets to meet diverse individual needs
EdMillerPoker,low iq precludes one from making it as a trader/gambler/entrepreneur type but a higher iq among a group of hi iqs only barely predicts success. duh?
GolcondaFund,"that won't help those who are hardest hit those who lose wages and their jobs.

i do not need your payroll tax cut you feckless fraud."
GolcondaFund,word of advice caution listening 2 wiseguy podcast if they harp on weak home underdog and say nothing bout the top 10 team they play #okst
nonrandomalpha,most of us have never seen a super bowl win in our lifetimes some havent even experienced a playoff win in their living memory...misery is justified.
nonrandomalpha,a lot of questionable coaching decisions being made across both teams in this game. its almost as if nagy and lafluer also sat out the preseason...
LeeSharpeNFL,the bengals and giants at least have good draft picks to improve their situation. we are cap strapped have low draft capital and a terrible quarterback.
LeeSharpeNFL,i think if the average non-technical person understood how often this is true even for major production systems at large companies they would be absolutely astonished.
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  happening because  it is  taking my preseason expectations into account not just the result of the week 1 game (though did they lose those!)
LeeSharpeNFL,hell i won't be sad if you beat us next week we're done anyway. pick six trubisky do your best to make him look bad. thanks.
LeeSharpeNFL,as always here's my live scoreboard to help you keep track of all of the games with 60 second updates and no ads or other bullshit:
LeeSharpeNFL,"bears 2020 opponents:

det x2 gb x2 minutes x2
atl car no tb
hou ind jax ten
lar
either nyg or was likely whoever wins tomorrow"
LeeSharpeNFL,murray has to know he can't take a sack. the fumble was unfortunate and forgivable to recover and get sacked there but the 1st down... yeesh.
LeeSharpeNFL,i hate this so much. especially if i'm also watching a stream or playing a game while code runs. my computer *cannot* handle it sometimes. :(
whale_capper,new deep dive is live... nfc south breakdown with some critical evaluation of the a team expected to contend that may have missed their window. enjoy!
whale_capper,yeah i shouldve specified what the pats did in 1h was the blueprint and the chiefs comeback was a testament to how amazing their offense is
AndyMSFW,seems a fitting adjective... i finished it in the oven and made too much glaze so i put layers on early and often.  many many layers.
AndyMSFW,got so busy chasing oklahoma tt over with oklahoma 2h tt over that i forgot about basketball for tomorrow!  well this is what i just bet.
AndyMSFW,i'll slip a favorite in there from time to time but mostly i'm looking for dogs that do some things that keep them in close games.
AndyMSFW,well the dolphins  daily fantasy sports  have a secondary either.  this kind of feels like the sort of game where touchdowns get scored on the regular.
AndyMSFW,roll your sleeve up reach high and pat yourself on the back!  you yes you sir or ma'am have more net offensive yards than the bears.
AndyMSFW,"2 takes it late for some money!!!
riding my inside man and his chalk.   says wicked whisper so wicked whisper it is
7wps
764 ex box"
AndyMSFW,i'm all in on a tank being optimal for the giants long term but they may struggle to even be the worst team in their division.
AndyMSFW,i thought stuff was usually out by tuesday evenings but it had me second guessing myself.  i checked last night and cris didn't have anything either.
AndyMSFW,i have him closer to the top than the bottom of my rankings for the week.  also he's available at 80/1 at a handful of shops
AndyMSFW,i've gotten so little done this week... but i know who putts well in windy conditions on the east coast categorized by who designed the course.
JoeyKnish22,thats very unfortunate. considering you only had like 12 full days to decide on a selection i feel terrible your last second attempted switch didnt process.
JoeyKnish22,the market steaming navy cause armys on a 3rd qb when the requisite skill set to play option qb is learn 4 plays and run fast.
JoeyKnish22,one of us mentioned toronto futures on the show 3 weeks ago. one of us didnt. ill let the people decide who the hero is here.
JoeyKnish22,tra minter is a really nice back. little undersized and not sure what he runs in the 40 but hes got an nfl level skill set.
JoeyKnish22,i sprinkled foreign policy +500 here. youve got ukraine turkey china lot of in the news cycle foreign policy issues at +500 its worth a hit.
JoeyKnish22,check your ab player props language. if hes suspended for game 1 a lot of them will void (and let books off the hook unfortunately ).
TheKostos,that field goal was so pathetic. making a two-score game a two-score game. lol. when ohio state gets the ball to start the second half!!! atrocious
TheKostos,falcons turn it over on downs at the 2 miss an extra point and then an easy field goal. lol. what a day of nfl gambling
TheKostos,second half of the soccer season (aka once football ends) is going to be soooo dope. cant wait to have more time to dig into it
TheKostos,it just wasnt that much fun watching knowing they were 100 percent  winning. def would have won last year if durant and klay didnt get hurt
TheKostos,that is one way to look at it sure. i meant more that there are only two teams actually capable of challenging europe's elite this year
LockyLockerson,i just realized this is probably a coach of the year elimination game.  winner advances to face shanahan in the final showdown weeks 16 and 17.
LockyLockerson,if i just typed cant believe the browns didnt get in again right now youd all think i was just watching a feed ahead of yours
LockyLockerson,"part 2: 

330p baylor +3
330p umass +7.5
330p fau +1.5
5p marshall +4
7p louisiana tech -9
7p oregon state +3
730p colorado state +24"
LockyLockerson,the auburn lookahead is never a narrative that will fly as thats also a big game and they have a week off before alabama as usual
LockyLockerson,will be at brother-in-laws birthday celebration all afternoon/early evening so thought it made sense.  may not get to totals nothing in noon window stands out anyway.
LockyLockerson,lar-car: market is rams by 1.5 i have it rams by 0.8.  those carolina 2.5/3's early in the week would have been a good grab apparently.
LockyLockerson,kc-pit: another home dog and a total  that is  too high.  pit +3.5 to win 1x pit +164 for 1x more under 46.5 to win 1x.
LockyLockerson,i actually think the winner this year is a limited pool of teams also so im not even disagreeing with that idea.  just seeking more info!
LockyLockerson,just understand this is so far from anger.  its genuinely funny.  this episode was funny.  i love earth.  what are we gonna get obsessed with next.
LockyLockerson,"sorry about that my fault!  usually if  it is  a first-game injury or ""new"" injury  that is  what i mean.  but i can definitely be clearer."
EliHershkovich,not taking a shot but hogs have no one who can beat off the dribble against an equally athletic team. gotta hit 3s  they did tonight.
EliHershkovich,ken's one of the best cappers around. appreciate you listening but no need to get upset with someone just because there's a sub for a model.
EliHershkovich,"such a fun show. excited to have  as a weekly contributor.

DannyParkins,kenny clark destroyed james daniels and that better not become a theme of the game. he got the best of whitehair a lot in the opener.
DannyParkins,dont blame the coach when the players miss wide open throws and fumble the football. you can criticize the players sometimes itll be ok i promise.
DannyParkins,its definitely a thing for all qbs. less of an emphasis when you have a 50  touchdown  season and are leading the league in yards/game though.
DannyParkins,every time i see rob riggle doing these fox nfl picks sketches it blows my mind fox still lets rob riggle do these nfl picks sketches.

DannyParkins,6 boxers have died in the last 3 years! i had no idea. that seems ridiculously high and according to this list the frequency is increasing.
DannyParkins,by the way if the bulls get zion i'm almost positive he won't want number 1 and will go back to 12 his high school jersey.
DannyParkins,hey  it is  the 21st anniversary of kerry wood's 20 strikeout game and he's gonna celebrate by joining  to tell some stories coming up at 2:20
DannyParkins,yea thats obviously wrong my bad. 123? 125? something like that. its 350ish for basketball is what i was thinking. an aside to the main point.
DannyParkins,contreras is off to a monster start and it'd be awesome if it wasn't being wasted. i'm liking my over 19.5  hour bet for him with
DannyParkins,very excited to have the creators of my favorite movie (rounders) and the best show on tv right now (billions)    on the show today at 3:25.
DannyParkins,seriously if nothing else just read the story. its inspiring and as worthy of a cause as i can imagine. heres a brief portion of it...
DannyParkins,i'd give him 6 stars if it was possible. got to ride in a tesla and he denied you the pop-tart in the car. loved it.

Gingfacekillah,you can track last available price before game start for a manual approximation. there are other ways but id rather not get into it too much.
Gingfacekillah,"""...the ichiros were able to clinch the division and finish with 102 wins and 1135 runs scored  4th-most in baseball history and most since 1894.""

Gingfacekillah,it really depends on how you look at it and which market (ps ml) is the more efficient of the two. its a good question though.
Gingfacekillah,is averaging the 3 best true odds method results together a horrible idea? if so which method would be your preference? im leaning towards the logarithmic.

PikachuBets,please address how you are claiming a full unit $300 record when you release  college basketball  extra games totals when bm/cris limits are still $250. frauds.
PikachuBets,good flex about being slightly older than i am but pls address the question sir. have you heard of or ever engaged with the fcs market?

adamchernoff,took the family out for bbq. collectively working through five pounds of meat and six sides seems like a reasonable accomplishment. happy thanksgiving to all celebrating.
adamchernoff,central texas rules apply. kosher salt mesh pepper and only oak to burn. no wrap or crutch. expecting it to be 13 hours working the fire.

Ccon8181,always hard to judge motivation but georgia in good position next year. suspensions were overblown and this baylor team very overrated. outperformed their metrics all year.
Ccon8181,it looked like a bad line when it opened then was bet up to -6.5. yuck. of it looks like shit smells like shit then ...
Ccon8181,so this guy made a living on tv giving opinions on when players should be drafted and he never saw them in action at the combine??
Ccon8181,whats the worst of these # college basketball  bad beats? what are the odds of being on all of the losing sides? asking for a friend.
Ccon8181,# college basketball  hasnt been good to me lately. feel it turns today. have a solid side locked in. hope to cash it and start rolling
Ccon8181,true he has played horrible but so has harden... plus harden doesnt play defense. but yea they need paul to put in work that was ugly
Ccon8181,you are confused.. i never employed a runner. i admitted to using a bookie over 8  years ago.statue of limitations is 3 years- if this occurred
Ccon8181,#nfl at it again. not one holding penalty an #steelers all game and you call that?! on game tying score! you can call that any play!
Ccon8181,looks like cg no longer respects my opinion. would heavily juice or move lines .5 on sides i hit. no longer after the month i've had.
Ccon8181,looks like # thursday night football  is using the same refs from the #houvsoak #mnf game. marking the ball yards forward or short on crucial plays
Ccon8181,haha 9-10 month of november-10 percent  only a degenerate gambler like yourself would lose his entire bankroll going 9-10. look long term +43 percent  y touchdown
Ccon8181,disappointing. the #browns play. down 7 catching 7 with the browns at the 45 going in and a pick 6. tough break. almost doubled at half..
Ccon8181,haha yea i do think belicheck is most of the reason. he goes all in and doesn't let up. players are smart enough it doesn't backfire
Ccon8181,my guy  wasn't happy i was on #miami  that is  why i have no favorite teams.. scratch that my favorite team is the one that covers.
Ccon8181,i've been a little quite on the twitter front due to the volume of work on my plate currently with the fund. appreciate all the support.
Ccon8181,did dabo sweeny just pass up a 30 yard field goal to end game (and cover) ?? coaches do some stupid shit. sorry #clemson backers #clemvsaub
Ccon8181,with the #nba season ending last month it marked the end of my year (football-basketball) a positive june made it 9 +$$ months out of 11
Ccon8181,they f me every which way so okc will prob cover but #gsw is the only side tonight imo. curry better not be a bitch tonight
Ccon8181,"weekly recap: very little registered. not going to force it. no investments but 2 free plays 

0-1 nba (+6.5 dog loses in ot)
1-0 mlb +1.1u"
Ccon8181,really like the #zags but was not the side. stuck with the system n #cuse got there... unfortunately #hoosiers are done. 2-1 day. on to next
Ccon8181,took a bad line and it bit me in the ass  that is  the difference between 5-2 and 4-3 and need every play we can get.
Ccon8181,last tweet but damn #iowa is nothing but a bunch of bumbling scrubs..  what the fuck  is this sorry ass product out of the big ten?
kellyinvegas,i was told along time ago. real men only hate a woman who broke their heart. as you can tell 70 percent  of twitter is well....
kellyinvegas,i share everything. i have insight from bookmakers help with lower ratings from  and  i watch the market on  database from  theres not ever enough info.
ToddFuhrman,you gotta find a way to bottle that energy and sell it to the masses my friend; its a level unseen in 99.9 percent  of americans
ToddFuhrman,no sir holiday congestion so we'll have an extended cut of pro and college later this week.  last monday was due to some unforeseen circumstances unfortunately
ToddFuhrman,"football friday  style with  . 

everything you need to know about the weekends biggest games in both the nfl and  college football 

 college football : 

nfl:"
ToddFuhrman,"nice little  saturday coming up at 11 eastern.

 hosts as       and myself break down the biggest games of the day from a betting perspective

come hang"
ToddFuhrman,announcement on that coming soon we'll be off until early august for sure.  rachel needed as much time as possible away from the 3 of us
ToddFuhrman,had to explain it 100x in a previous world cup how the numbers worked while behind the counter youd have thought my presentation was in greek
ToddFuhrman,good point; i cover gambling for a living and the last 15 seconds have major implications but ive been meaning to switch to religion and politics
TheCousinSal,well thats that. the eagles were better-prepared (go figure).  we needed one of the 13 overthrows to gallup to be on target.  never got there. #lincolnriley2020
TheCousinSal,4 hits in 18 innings is as bad an offensive showing as you'll ever see from a home team in a league championship series. #redbirds #redwedding
TheCousinSal,this marcus stroman trade makes no sense for the mets aside from the fact that it prevented the yankees from trading for marcus stroman. bravo brodie!
TheCousinSal,i cant get enough of the drunk fan shifting emotions from confusion to feigned jubilation once his/her team selects a player theyve never heard of. #nfldraft19
TheCousinSal,probably not a good thing but at this point zack wheeler has a better shot at winning the  hour title than the cy young award. #lgm
TheCousinSal,pete alonsos power is starting to become unfair. its only a matter of time before mlb forces him to use a wiffle ball bat. #letsgomets #polarpower
TheCousinSal,i shant acknowledge the new kings reign. ive decided to take the next 5 days off. todays masters was as wild as a  ceremonial first pitch.
TheCousinSal,salvatore is as much my name as your moms is loretta bonnetta. wikipedia sometimes gets things wrong.  for instance your wikipedia page says...wait...sorry not seeing it.
TheCousinSal,on an all-new against all odds - the degenerate trifecta and i preview no/dal lac/pitt okl/tex and bama/georgia + best bets and nfl prop specials. #gambling
TheCousinSal,bad beats world series mvp talk mailbag best bets + we break down who makes a better baby...serena/lebron or rousey/gronk on an all-new  #againstallodds podcast. #gambling
TheCousinSal,on an all-new #againstallodds week 5 best bets nfl player props mlb playoff picks khabib/conor talk and  botches the pronunciation of yet another athletes name. #gambling
TheCousinSal,i won by 2.2 points and that was after the double  touchdown  score was adjusted. now onto the semi's where i shall thrash don draper's squad.
TheCousinSal,the saints are going to be a very tough out in the playoffs. and im starting to think that bills might be a very tough in.
TheCousinSal,i can't believe  it is  been 2 years. i miss this guy so much. today  let us  all kick ass  chew bubble gum in his honor
TheCousinSal,there is no way houton will come back to win this game - yet for the next hour degenerates will be glued to the tv.  #whygamblingisgreat
TheCousinSal,i'm fine with the mike mccarthy hire. similar to garrett but with a winning pedigree. also i checked out his clapping hands. still very much intact.
12Xpert,although this means the bookmakers is taking a position it does mean they are increasing their ev. have a read here if you haven't seen it.
12Xpert,not for the 43 percent  who say they want a tory government only for the others who exhibit a moral superiority over those 43 percent .
12Xpert,it is  a good hypothesis. follow the money. if i every win the euromillions i'll set up an open source bookmaker and we can test it.
12Xpert,in the meantime try to come up with an a priori hypothesis for why binomial does not apply to betting outcomes. i would be genuinely interested.
12Xpert,it might be that the atp/way is efficient and is doubted by inefficient challengers and futures data. but i didnt drill down into the data here.
12Xpert,if there is a figure less than infinity that you would not want to lose over liverpool winning the league then you're not a proper fan.
12Xpert,this little calculator can help you learn more about what range of possible performances you might reasonably expect. its probably much larger than you ever imagined.
12Xpert,also unclear why some of those said affiliates still earning were the very ones bringing  and the affiliate industrys reputation into disrepute in the first place.
JambosPicks,tonight's all about #gbvschi but we've got  college football  plays for this weekend too! sign up at  and purchase a package to see our college  recommendations.
JambosPicks,"there's your first winner of the day jambos subscribers! the #angels lead the #rangers 5-0 after 5 and our under 6 (f5) play has hit. 

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,soooo our #indians-#yankees under 6 (f5) and cle (f5) plays didn't work out but there's still plenty of  left for our cle moneyline play to hit!
JambosPicks,19-4-1 against the spread on the jambos podcast picks. listen for 3 picks.  also 14 total picks up on   free for everyone   #jambos #gamblingtwitter #sportsbets #freeplays
mschwimer,and again. this would have 0 effect on our record as all our picks are graded at the bookmaker line at time we release the pick.
mschwimer,you simply cant say that. how would you explain us willing to put millions of dollars in an account that  chooses to back our stuff up?
mschwimer,i like to think im a good father to my 4 year old daughter and 1 year old son. also a good husband to my wife
mschwimer,got a car music system (cuz my cd player broke) i got the cheapest possible because bass doesnt matter when you listen to bruce all day.
mschwimer,i will be going to the game and wearing my ahmad bradshaw jersey... do i send pics? or do i just keep it on the dl?
mschwimer,i am not frustrated at all... i love the phillies and i think they are a first class organization. but that doesnt mean they like me
RufusPeabody,conflict resolution -- liaison between bettors and regulatory authorities/books if disputes arise. (note that this doesn't mean we would blindly support all bettors in disputes.)
RufusPeabody,"college football playoff now-cast (via  committee prediction model):

1) ohio st
2) lsu
3) clemson
4) georgia
5) oklahoma
6) utah
7) baylor
8) wisconsin"
RufusPeabody,tom! too bad i didn't run into you. what a game! do you still have to send cash in the mail to get his pickz?
RufusPeabody,you want to reward wins and losses too. how often is the super bowl the two best teams. we have no issue with that though.
RufusPeabody,it should be decided by what happens on the field as much as possible. i think you have to throw out priors. just my 2c
RufusPeabody,thats a big part of it. easy to under or overshrink depending on what youre betting into vs what you used to calibrate the shrinkage
RufusPeabody,the irs definitely allows for some leeway. but in my opinion if the majority of your income comes from gambling you are a professional gambler.
RufusPeabody,"him: ""i'm paul""
me: ""hey paul i'm rufus""
him: ""rufus?""
me: ""rufus like a dog's name""
him: ""you're shitting me. my dog's name is rufus"""
RufusPeabody,um no it wasn't. it was a response to someone repying to samkon. ras quote retweeted it. it had literally nothing to do with ras.
jeffma,any entrepreneur who starts a company with the goal of selling it sucks imho and this is coming from someone who has sold 4 companies
jeffma,it isnt a joke. it is a real question. legitimately the eagles would seem like the public side... yet line has moved away from them.
jeffma,i think  nailed it when he said the model wasn't built with gambling in mind. but it is still irresponsible to display it as fact
jeffma,"we would then ""remove the vig"" by dividing 0.52 (-110 odds) / 1.17 which would give us implied odds of heads at 45 percent ."
jeffma,the problem is that markets do not give you exact implied odds. they give you a range. and that range grows based on juice size
jeffma,in that case i was referring to blair walsh. but in general i was referring to every kicker who has missed a kick this week
SportsCheetah,another interesting ending: the wizards were up 96-84 with 5 minutes remaining. it was 96-96 with 1 second left before beal hit the go-ahead bucket.
SportsCheetah,up to you really can go cheaper +$ route or try to middle it taking the points. can do some of both. you have options.
SportsCheetah,that was some final minute and it ended in a bjelica 35-footer to win it at the buzzer. that will probably never be tweeted again.
SportsCheetah,sure you brought up the scoring against the nets pr thing is all so i went with a scoring option when this guy mentioned contest.
SportsCheetah,i think  thoughts on osuna here and cole out of pen to end it if houston escapes the inning are at the very least intriguing.
SportsCheetah,did i tell you about the time i walked by a roulette table at bovada in vegas and saw........... 158 reds hit in a row?
capjack2000,"william hill has mlb regular season wins up already. a very surprising first-to-market by wh. 

by next year were going to betting rsws in october."
capjack2000,betcast showed the sixers +220 in live betting when they were down by 13. that should play well when the knicks collapse in the 4q.
capjack2000,knicks start the 3q on a 15-0 run and the commentators are beside themselves. they keep checking the live line (which is close to pk).
capjack2000,continues to improve his chroma key game. good lighting as well. now  let us  work on the audio. lapel mic would go a long way.
capjack2000,the only way gvc is going to have a 10-15 percent  market share in nj within 6 months would be to buy william hill us.
capjack2000,"thanks im aware of the difference. 

the joke was the look on his face at having someone open up a briefcase with $3.5m in cash."
capjack2000,i think the product upgrade is a net-positive and since i'm using it on ios  that is  a good sign for approval in other states.
capjack2000,depends on house rules of the book you bet at but i've never seen one that called it action on a game suspended that long.
capjack2000,want to wager some big money on the open...nevermind that want to wager $50?  daily fantasy sports  bother going to rivers in schnectedy new york
capjack2000,"do i have to do everyone's jobs for them? 

seriously though a complaint from a state regulatory board holds more weight than an app developer."
capjack2000,are you talking about this infamous mr. poison? ive always assumed that was all made up and the dollar amounts were just to get eyeballs.
capjack2000,hey look an old clip from the ultimate blackjack tour on cbs. back when televised blackjack tournaments were going to be the next big thing....
capjack2000,one last update. all games are now listed at  i do like that -105 on nationally broadcast games. hope they hold that for the playoffs.
dinkinc,which is exactly what goes on today... people found it offensive if you kneeled during another simple song...president called them sob's and no one blinked
dinkinc,you tweeted about bringing a new friend to her first show at bar as it also was your first show... did she like it ?
dinkinc,and you can express that opinion. i am always willing to listen to both views on abortions. thats much tougher for me than gun reform
dinkinc,just remember that is how it is in almost every country.... russia. china. north korea ... 1940's hitler.... respect those that deserve to be respected
dinkinc,thanks but gambling can be overwhelming and evil... i thought the movie was fair minded... there are many people who do this better than me
robpizzola,im searching around now but id say anything at 2/1 or better. i dont think conte is going to give a fuck about europa league.
robpizzola,namath threw 220 ints to 173  touchdown s in his career. he is the single worst player in any hof across all the pro sports.
robpizzola,vegas pretty dominant through two. leafs played a great third. a couple of huge fleury saves... the tap-in from nylander and that robbery on petan.
robpizzola,gotta agree with everything here. terrible personality terrible picks terrible beard. he calls himself a cheetah because of how fast he can drain a bankroll.
robpizzola,im definitely in the minority but i find aryas character to be one of the least interesting. always thought the lannisters were much more developed.
RASPicks,"clearly our service isn't for everyone but if +307 units means ""lost tons of money"" to you then i'm guessing you have some other issues."
RASPicks,certainly wnba lines are not as efficient as the big three pro sports.  but the difference is a lot smaller than it used to be.
RASPicks,college basketball  update: 134-104 56.3 percent  +18.4 units y touchdown . for a limited time get 20 credits for $250 (50 percent  off normal rate).
RASPicks,ras  college football  totals have performed even better in week 1 of the season going 17-9 (65.2 percent ) over the past five years.  .co/7biqrhwtyb
RASPicks,college football  game 175/176 notre dame to suspend 4 starters (possibly more) soon.  current -22.5/-23 and -24 in vegas.  line sure to drop on news.
RASPicks,buffettgambler went 47-31 (60.3 percent ) in the nfl last year.  he will start posting week 1 plays today exclusively at .co/lijtndf field goal k.
RASPicks,"""fading"" does not work.  there is no such thing as a talent for picking losers at a rate high enough to beat -110 long term."
RASPicks,college football  full game plays 7-6 yesterday 16-10 y touchdown .  second half plays 0-2 yesterday 1-3 y touchdown .  play by play recap:  .co/0eod6sn
RASPicks,ras college football releases are now 77-43 (64.1 percent ) since the start of the 2009 season.  14 of 16 winning weeks in that span.
VegasRefund,every time i try to become interested in the world cup im reminded by how pathetic it is that the usa is not a participant.
VegasRefund,said this before.. but it seems like making gambling legal will only make life more difficult for those who already have a process in place.
VegasRefund,"ohio +6.5
umass +7
fordham +9

ProfessorShine,cant be overstated how bad it is to have games where starters dont have to play.    id be for any format where it didnt exist.
ProfessorShine,it is almost universal that hes terrible at this and it takes away from the game.  the ratings arent much different than last few years.
ProfessorShine,youre saying 33 percent  from 3 is a negative. it isnt.   agree he is old and cant guard anyone but the problem isnt his shooting.
ProfessorShine,for the record i never used the word all;  most is very accurate.  for the sports i bet a large majority are posted offshore first.
ProfessorShine,nova is shaky.  needed phantom calls to win yesterday.  2 isnt a given but theyll be favored in their 1st two games so theres that
ProfessorShine,its only being made cause they have same promotion.  crawford-spence or thurman-spence are better fights.  garcia-vasyl is a better fight.  plus ppv is extra dumb
suuma810,the falcons are averaging 2.3 yards per carry today but they already called nine runs. just stop it and give your best players the ball.
suuma810,#allornothing episode 2: matt ryan goes 23/28 for 9.7 ypa  a 95.6 qbr against the #panthers but ron rivera was furious about the run defense
suuma810,"stop everything you are doing and read the atlanta #falcons preview for the upcoming #nfl season 

starting lineups dan quinns offensive philosophy schedule analysis  predictions"
suuma810,the #jets were trying to ice the lead against the #packers - by running on 2nd  23 because it worked so well during the game.
suuma810,"3-1 to start the week 

ravens tt over 19.5 
jets tt over 22 
texans moneyline 
browns -6.5 
rams/cardinals under 47
chiefs / seahawks over 54.5"
suuma810,i dont think that was all in hacketts interest. as if marrone said: we got the lead dont make anything stupid. just hand it off.
suuma810,we are almost there! good luck tonight everyone - enjoy the game! no play for us. one of the crazier line moves in a while.
ClevTA,yeah i mean who wouldnt want food that tastes really really good cool atmosphere with hot girls walking around when they are in vegas! lol
ClevTA,so dallas was just -3 in chicago so philly and bears are a pk on neutral? i make this philly -1.5 but thats just me
ClevTA,the only time the steelers have moved the ball is throwing deep so they come out with a brilliant run run to start a drive
ClevTA,what's amazing is buffalo allowed ap to run for 17+ yards 4 times last week. ap has 12 of those runs on the entire season
ClevTA,guess if u think going for it on 4th and 7 from 38 where the wind was swirling? i wouldnt but to each his own
ClevTA,i dont know the answer but have the browns run a single pick or run route inside the 5 yet this year? i dont recall
ClevTA,but dont worry obj is the real problem child wr in the nfl i was told. havent heard a negative peep about him all summer
CizzlingSports,as long as  is thumping his chest here ask jeph abt his past record at  and why he's made his account there private now lol
CizzlingSports,she's a documented long-term losing bettor who first failed selling negative expected value picks in her underwear to suckers like you.  it is  fine tho

spanky,"this is absolute bullshit. i know the whole animal crew and they have nothing to do with you.

real truth is they get me outs."
spanky,ha. cb overnights are not considered overnights the day before the tournament. when i say overnights i mean lines that have been hung for seconds/minutes
spanky,odd worth more than even cuz game cant end in a tie.  we make 7 a little over 30 cents ...8 is about 16 cents
spanky,my daughter lily and her team won the jv volleyball championship. i had them priced as a huge dog. handicapping 12 year olds is tough
spanky,yes. i love how you made her name jewish. my runner in vegas back in the day was named eli. he spoke yiddish and everything.
spanky,there is no more sincere  and beautiful emotion in all of sports than watching these at large teams reaction to get their chance to dance...
spanky,my case was actually ny state and  not one of 25 defendants went to prison.  if youre gonna hate at least get your facts straight.
spanky,nothing but respect for you bert.  7-8 years ago the south point was my runners 730am-815am stop right before the m opened up at 830am.
spanky,is a hopefully soon to be licensed exchange.... im going to follow them closely. as for limits they are a necessary evil in our business.
DocBettor,"aria blackjack switch blackjack pays even money dealer 22 pushes

dealer up card: 7
hand 1: t9
hand 2: 8a

what do you do? #gamblingtwitter"
DocBettor,that is  where i got the numbers from... there's only a link for the weekly so i took the figures from the cumulative for 9/3-9/6.
PlusEVAnalytics,actually im wrong. in a parimutuel system an average skilled bettor is losing 25c on the dollar. an unskilled bettor is losing more than that.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh god that makes me cringe. from best to worst 1 dont ding them 2 ding them 3 give them the right/option to ding them
PlusEVAnalytics,gotta prorate the subscription fee and the rebate then less than 2/17 of it has been realized. if were gonna get weird lets get weird.
PlusEVAnalytics,how long have you been buying from whom for how much and what is your betting record? only if you are willing to share. thanks!
PlusEVAnalytics,this is like keeping your 107 year old great great grandmother on life support. she lived a good life its time to let her go.
PlusEVAnalytics,why is there a log-gamma function and not a gamma function i asked myself until i tried to evaluate gamma(a+b)/gamma(a) for large a. well played
PlusEVAnalytics,contagion is sufficient but not necessary for epistemic uncertainty. im more scared of asteroids and nuclear holocausts even though they kill fewer people than bathtubs.
PlusEVAnalytics,thought experiment - its the day after election day and bernie sanders is your president-elect. how much lower is the sp than it is today?
PlusEVAnalytics,anyone who doesnt think the other 46 people said chicken is fooling themselves. popeye the sailor man hasnt been culturally relevant in what 30 years?
aluckyaday,not sure if its good or bad. the 2 i have in the break have gone off the front. good move or suicide mission  ?
aluckyaday,moving towards the sharp side when you have more public money on the other side does not achieve that. they already need the sharp side!
aluckyaday,what do the bookies know? cut aus after the performance now pushing them out 11/1 with lads. very suspicious do they have a vote mole?
joeytunes2,it is  crazy. i took under 41.5 and baylor 7 7.5. winning the wrong way losing the right way. big moves ten to over move
joeytunes2,oregon is so badly coached..  it is  amazing. the glory days of luring kids with jerseys are over. 7or 8 win teams from now on.
joeytunes2,lol. not gonna lie i wanna smack you around. but all good i get your a troll account. all good brother. keep the accounts coming
joeytunes2,exchanges are the best. but i  daily fantasy sports  think enough opposition to guys like us. you see how hard it is to get outs..
joeyisaks,i dont like video games didnt even play much as a kid... but i have zero idea what to do all day im quarantining myself
joeyisaks,if someone in basketball coaching circles came up with a new way to shoot and every team copied the techniques i touchdown  be that guy
joeyisaks,these ones stuck with these loans are the victims cause tuition prices / loan rates werent known by them? im missing why theyre so entitled
joeyisaks,dodgers front office has made nothing but very smart moves from analytics and business  perspective i love what they have done the past 6 months
joeyisaks,shouldnt a site claiming to make people smarter bettors tell this kid hes a moron and will never win this way instead of glorifying this
EdMillerPoker,"while the commas are  fd has you betting on ""draws"" ""pre-match"". dk/fd are dominant because they have both better brands and products at the moment."
EdMillerPoker,"an apple a day keeps anyone away if you throw it hard enough

my 9yo sons joke im just turn my twitter over to him"
nonrandomalpha,i think it will get close to this by kickoff. mannings broncos were close to this kind of spread in 2013 v jags i believe.
nonrandomalpha,"i'm an alum and financial supporter of the program not a mere ""fan"" or gainesville local. thus the obviously steep discrepancy between our reasoning skills."
LeeSharpeNFL,vic fangio needs to be better than that. he needs to know where he is and is not comfortable having the kicker make an attempt.
LeeSharpeNFL,"andy reid is challenging a dpi no call halfway through the first quarter.

he's really iterating and finding new ways to have terrible game management."
LeeSharpeNFL,honestly if you aren't in us the international game pass i would say is well worth your money but does it not have all 22?
LeeSharpeNFL,"trubisky's second game this season that meets the incredibly low bar of ""a positive epa/play"".

it was still below the average quarterback-game since 2018 though."
LeeSharpeNFL,"oh and i left out one huge factor:

no is a lock to win their division while sf could easily lose their division to sea."
LeeSharpeNFL,also why i  daily fantasy sports  follow the nfl. also my alma mater (university of illinois) has been terrible at football for a long time.
whale_capper,did you know there was a live show where we handicap nfl and you can participate in the chat? come check it out on  :
whale_capper,new deep dive is live we reflect on the results from a weird week and try to make sense of the week 7 openers... enjoy!
whale_capper,deep dive division previews roll on with the afc west where the closer we get to the season the more things stay the same. enjoy!
whale_capper,yeah i guess... noted the likelihood of brissett week 1 ticked up and chargers -3 drifted 23 cents surprised no reaction to colts south price
whale_capper,that was a very good take... break-even prob at 2.4 percent  now what do you think the fair  percent  is? somewhere between 3-5 percent ?
whale_capper,you can throw most things out when it comes to game 7s especially if this is a competitive game which i think it will be
AndyMSFW,have you two discussed which golf tournament you'll have to skip for the wedding?  i'd lean rocket mortgage or 3m if those dates work.  congrats!
AndyMSFW,i've seen some shots of the crowd i guess every in pittsburgh decided it was a good excuse to take a vacation to somewhere warm.
AndyMSFW,i had heard thursday until a bit ago and still thought the raiders road/road/london stretch would at least even that out.   (not looking that way)
AndyMSFW,i'm starting to think about possibly moving into the camp  that is  ok with listening to the possibility of thinking about starting tannehill over mariota
AndyMSFW,"round 3:

JoeyKnish22,i buried max on this topic along time ago doug. some people will never learn. but we need some fish out there feeding the books
JoeyKnish22,ill be on cash considerations tomorrow with the guys! it will be like that time when they had lindeman on except probably 100x more entertaining.
JoeyKnish22,comedy routines and sports commentary dont mix. the sports is the entertainment. i dont need some clown with the jokes all game in the booth.
JoeyKnish22,have seen some way hotter girls in the stands and cheerleading than i ever would have imagined at a wyoming game in 20 degree weather.
JoeyKnish22,yes the source is curtis blackwell and hes suing the school for millions in damages for wrongful termination. we will see how it plays out.
JoeyKnish22,aikman and buck making tough guy butkus jokes cause they cant wait 30 seconds for a divot that could break somebodies ankle to get fixed.
JoeyKnish22,added some more at action since i dont know what im doing but i really just want to root against rovells husband the mattress guy.
JoeyKnish22,some people i know really liked canada at those prices and made back a lot of the money canada cost them at the gold cup.
JoeyKnish22,you dont think that capital could/would be better served elsewhere to earn a higher return/compounded over 12-16 months than laying -1050? not trolling genuine question.
TheKostos,i want to blame nagy and trubisky for miller being a fantasy title game bust but really its my fault for trusting this horseshit offense
TheKostos,i wanna see destiny back next year in the tuition challenge and if she wins she gets 100k for herself. would be must-see halftime entertainment
TheKostos,it gives me great pleasure to know that at any point there are people ive muted who are having conversations with themselves in my mentions
TheKostos,to the people up in arms over last weeks nfl sides i hope you enjoyed the colts on thursday and a perfect  college football  saturday.
TheKostos,"the great  with us now  talking soccer. if you like the soccer breakdowns on the show you will love this. that is a promise.

watch:"
TheKostos,fuck yes. over. 3-0. lewandowski on the counter. i feel dirty rooting against chelsea but they had no chance today. it is what it is
TheKostos,honestly we (meaning tampa bettors) are the assholes here. we watched this  trestman in chicago and still chose to lay our money on his team
TheKostos,no disrespect to vic but him being elevated to that team never made sense. phillips is much better right now.  it is  the right move
LockyLockerson,college hoops projections/analysis now up for sunday as well over at patreon.  as the  college football  night simmers down swing by and check stuff out.
LockyLockerson,. and  talked be into betting the bucs and this is quite frankly an additional stressful rollercoaster i'm not sure i need in my life.
LockyLockerson,best bet is umass which is another number thats gone completely haywire and may not be correct given how little we know about each team
LockyLockerson,i'll be doing some occasional pieces for  this preseason on specific fun nfl futures/prop markets going into the season deep-diving into each.  should be fun.
LockyLockerson,the easiest way would just be to see how significant each side is to wins or win difference year to year then youd get weights
LockyLockerson,some are out already maybe 6-7? small limits.  week 0 is out in a few places.  but id say midweek on game week for reals
LockyLockerson,not something i think you'd ever see at a lot of books  daily fantasy sports  really have a good explanation for why they'd do it.
LockyLockerson,it was only because i was in such good shape with big ravens numbers.  wanted to diversify a bit. wouldnt have just added them solo.
EliHershkovich,purdue averaging 0.85 ppp over its last two games   it is  hard to see 'em figuring it out against uva's pack-line. can't space the floor.

DannyParkins,will have full review with observations is a weird way to describe a vacation dude its not a your first time attending an sec tailgate.
DannyParkins,ha! nothing to apologize for. vikings last night 10 straight run plays to lock up that win.  it is  beautiful if you can do it.
DannyParkins,how is the 2015 sugar bowl relevant to todays discussion? also i had ohio state ranked in front of alabama. clearly youre not paying attention.
DannyParkins,throwing short of the goal line on a game winning 2 point conversion is the type of thing you do when youre trying to lose
DannyParkins,pat mahomes insane highlight  touchdown  leads into a pat mahomes commercial on the nfl's premier broadcast of the week. he's the face of the league.
DannyParkins,these refs are shook. made every call early and now are panicking and missing obvious calls. so of course we get extra stoppages and reviews.
DannyParkins,antique taco bridgeport i just left 4 tickets to tomorrows #whitesox game. 35th st  morgan. its star wars night so theres an r2d2 giveaway. go!
chadmillman,smart nuanced take from  could also argue it already is good for golf. pga championship: koepkas runaway more proof gambling would be good for golf
chadmillman,the team  has been really thoughtful about how betting can help engage and entertain fans. thrilled to be a partner to what they are building.
chadmillman,nfl playoffs legal betting = new bettors. heres our handy how to bet package that explains this world. cc  for anyone asking you for this.
chadmillman,whether you bet or not this analysis of best odds for nfl teams to win their division is a cool preview for rest of year.
chadmillman,hey  it is  the u.s. open. scooch  i debated phil mickelson's entry as a fan nominee into our proposed sports betting hof in latest episode.
chadmillman,i played cincy yday afternoon might go back to that well today. line is moving in reds direction even though majority of action on cubs.
chadmillman,this shot of  as our sports weather guy gets me every time. are you sad? are you concerned about the dry weather in the southwest?
chadmillman,this masters betting  daily fantasy sports  guide from  crew is comprehensive easy to use and makes this tourney feel like the betting holiday it is.
chadmillman,why does life have to move so fast? weve barely finished celebrating umbc and we already have to think about if it will win tmrw.
chadmillman,the prop from contest winner  did serious handle + the prop that killed scooch.  explains his love of the wizards as a value post-season play
chadmillman,i think its changing now in all media from wapo nyt and even the athletic to places like crunchyroll. especially true of more niche-driven properties.
chadmillman,"my (free) column abt the huge # of super bowl props being posted this year + the ""get your prop up in vegas"" contest. .co/89cvhudmat"
chadmillman,"just edited a story with the phrase ""i think jonathan winters and ricardo montalban were at the party too."" any guesses what  it is  about?"
chadmillman,have a trivia question about the nfl combine you think will stump our panel? send it my way and you can ask on  this week.
chadmillman,it is  called a betting guide but what  does with tonight's title game is really a blueprint for analysis ... whether you bet or not.
Gingfacekillah,traditional possession formula reliably overestimates # of possessions for almost all teams. something along the lines of -2.23+(1.07* field goal a)+(0.37*fta)+(-1.23*orb)+(0.87*tov) appears a bit better.
Gingfacekillah,a simple time decay weighting scheme using game # and sum of game #'s. also check out  website for some handy ideas in this area.
Gingfacekillah,some but i've done my best to strip the heavy math and technical language out of the book to make it more accessible for beginners.
Gingfacekillah,no  college football  for me. i do bet low flat stakes for nfl but not until week 5. track closing line value for that yes.
Gingfacekillah,thanks for the insight. i boosted the generations to 250 and let it run overnight. not much improvement. i'll try tweaking it with your suggestions!
Gingfacekillah,so real. ease off with the armpit spears bud there's no scouts in the stand at this 10:30 wednesday night start div 5 barn burner.
Gingfacekillah,this right here. adjusting your variance without an edge is pointless. you  daily fantasy sports  work donkey bets into sharp action with money management alchemy.
Gingfacekillah,you can do other things to understand where the scoring is coming from too. 3pt  percent  is an important factor for considering totals for example.
Gingfacekillah,can i ask how you determined time on ice by line? the minute weighting seems particularly important. i'm trying to do something similar for basketball.
Gingfacekillah,scale and impact of collusion are going to be factors. but likely a cause of action the cost-benefit analysis of pursuing a judicial remedy notwithstanding
logan_matthews9,those are tied paid in full lines (via bovada). also like kuchar +175 wolff +275 and mcdowell +500 but wont play them due to exposure.
logan_matthews9,"i think its just his generic term for people who use numbers to bet instead of feel like him...

you know winning vs losing players"
logan_matthews9,"this is almost definitely negative expected value but a reverse teaser parlay i got about 23-1 on:

texas tech -6.5
ole miss -34
liberty +10.5"
logan_matthews9,youve literally said youre on twitter to get betting partners - so yes you are definitely trying to get more followers and are selling yourself
logan_matthews9,im very surprised the guy who claims he can dunk bench press 400 run a marathon and has a genius iq isnt more level headed
logan_matthews9,saw a couple books drop tex st to 32 so i grabbed 33.5. hopeful ull will sneak back to 21 since i missed it before.
logan_matthews9,if you believe that juergen and berhalter have been at all similar so far im not sure what to tell you... couldnt be more different
PikachuBets,also imagine sucking off a tout like that while using a profile pic with your kid in it. #gamblingtwitter the goat for too many reasons
PikachuBets,imagine thinking that avoiding foul game means less bad beats. imagine thinking foul game = bad beats. lol jesus no wonder you follow phosports lol
PikachuBets,berry kelly stakes is what  has started calling these unrealistic 20u based on my edge plays. i think it is genius and have stolen it.
PikachuBets,straw man. he said they dont sell picks. but one of tans subsidiaries clearly sells picks. whether they perform well is irrelevant to this comment.
adamchernoff,apke officially inactive. entire redskins secondary plus norman is out against dallas. 108 combined snaps on the season for all five projected starters this afternoon.
adamchernoff,"packers or pretenders? 

is the team i was most bullish on to begin the season now one of the best fades in the nfl? 

watch:"
adamchernoff,"back at it! 

my first nfl column of the season kicks off year three with  and i am staking heavier than usual on a total."
adamchernoff,glad you are enjoying the channel expecting a big year upcoming! already near the 2018/2019 season high for members and continuing to grow each day.
adamchernoff,honestly i just searched the show on google and took the link that goes to the apple page open it and then copy the url.
adamchernoff,incredibly this happens every week in the nfl season. easy way to distinguish who does this as a hobby and who does this for real.
adamchernoff,"great comment from a listener of the show. glad to see people enjoying the daily episodes and taking things away from them. 

enjoy your friday"
Ccon8181,"ready to get back on track for bowl season. 1-2 so far. on these two 

#ucf -15.5 and 

#ucf #marshall under 59.5 

#gasparillabowl #bowlszn #bowlseason"
Ccon8181,"hold your breath and put this bet in.. or go with the unstoppable russel wilson. but im on:

#vikings +3 -115 

#mnf #minvssea #nfltwitter #minnesotavikings"
Ccon8181,for once didnt have to sweat #huskies laying points in the #applecup2019 .. got the cover for a 2-0 day. big day on deck tomorrow!!
Ccon8181,the #browns are (again) as bad as they look..  what the fuck  is this defensive effort. team must be ready for kitchens to get canned
Ccon8181,damn yesterdays #ncaatournament games got me... that was a tough sequence. with nothing on deck until thursday these are going to be done long days.
Ccon8181,its not... purdue shot way above season averages even adjusted for penn states bad defense. expect a regression 2nd half plus added value. ill bite
Ccon8181,it was tough pulling the trigger on this next play.. but really strong position. yall will hate it so will my investors. until it covers
Ccon8181,bang!! no better feeling then cracking the sorry ass #pac12refs and #stanford hc david shaw at the same damn time with this blowout #irishnation win!!
Ccon8181,i would love for dantoni or paul to berate harden. almost every #warriors point comes off of his poor defense or not fighting through pick.
Ccon8181,never fails with #jayhawks ... cover for 99 percent  of the game miss free throws dont rebound foul down stretch. hate that team. just brutal
Ccon8181,i agree against mid level teams but happ struggles verse strong  bigs. davidson got them the cover. but yes wisconsin at home can be tough
Ccon8181,#baylor strong side tonight and will probably cover. they are the georgetown of this year. lots of value but find ways to blow the cover
Ccon8181,they were definitely upset lol. i had to take some tums and hit the gym. decent day but wish the #vikes hit. merry christmas brotha
Ccon8181,defense didn't help giving up back to back 90 yard drives for  touchdown s at end of game. but yea he was bad as well.
Ccon8181,i'm already on this one and its not a game to double down on. but if your not on it there's currently value on az
Ccon8181,instead of being down 8 at half #bills down 14. gonna need every point to cover this.  that is  not going to get it done.
Ccon8181,had to cut vaca short to come out to do some press and meetings. back to sdflight lands at 2:33 tee time at 3 shit!
Ccon8181,"not my strongest play. got some heavy mushes on this side as well but  it is  the only play imo. 

#cavaliers +6 

#nbabetting #gswvscavs #nba"
Ccon8181,sorry i couldn't respond to all requests for live in game betting 2nd half advice.. but if you want to profit.. invest in the fund!
Ccon8181,i think there is an issue with yahoo or hotmail bc the ppl who say they  daily fantasy sports  get them have that in common.
Ccon8181,jermey lin and courtney lee got that cover and win by themselves after kemba took night off!props to the coach for leaving them in. #hornets
kellyinvegas,not a bad day on  got caught up on the bowl games vs the social guys and had a nice day on the live show
ToddFuhrman,millions of people saw it; myles buried himself dont defend any of this nonsense in a brutal game thats a chicken shit act of cowardice
ToddFuhrman,"that didn't take long...patriots already out to 17 point favorites in the offshore market

look-ahead line before dolphins loss and ab signing was pats -11"
ToddFuhrman,i hope you held out for a holiday weekend at the beach house and he threw in airfare airport transport and a proper food credit
ToddFuhrman,"who will  play game 1 for in the 2019-20 season?

thunder 7-4
knicks 2-1
heat 4-1
pistons 6-1
rockets 6-1
timberwolves 7-1

(odds via  )"
ToddFuhrman,when harrison barnes is in a position to turn down 25m to possibly make even more under a new contract the league has gone mad
ToddFuhrman,it is  a 30 cent market justin so the other side is -130; if it were juice free you'd be 100 percent  accurate on that
ToddFuhrman,if toronto is worried about me calling them a hockey town and this is the first response after winning a title i cant help you
ToddFuhrman,"updated: odds to be the 1st pick in the #nfldraft2019 

kyler murray -500
nick bosa +400
quinnen williams +500
josh allen +5000

(odds via  )"
ToddFuhrman,ha would be the lowest total we've seen all tournament but could only hope for some perception inflation to go under.  first team to 45...
ToddFuhrman,lou...this is one of the only times playing a parlay is beneficial rather than having separate straight bets.  trust me we've all been there before
ToddFuhrman,clearly an apples to apples comparison...grad students library employees and those on work study definitely get all the same benefits of being a d-1 athlete
ToddFuhrman,might be some broken tv's in columbus; buckeyes blow a 6 point halftime lead and get outscored 18-2 final 7:40 as 12 point dogs #osuvsmsu
TheCousinSal,in addition to his injured shoulder wrist and hand - daks feelings are getting destroyed when every single pass is dropped by a cowboys wr/te/rb.
TheCousinSal,dont know what to make of this sf team.  flawed defensively all of a sudden but they sure know how to win crazy close games.
TheCousinSal,"cowboys beat rams...

cowboys beat eagles in philly..

cowboys lose at home to redskins...

eagles win the nfc east

dont even pretend this isnt happening."
TheCousinSal,"top 3 things in life that make no sense to me...
1) the placebo effect
2) building of the pyramids
3) nick foles nfl career"
TheCousinSal,apparently ive made it so that theres no possible way to lose money wagering on   so please just take their loot and make them happy.
TheCousinSal,im not saying aaron rodgers owns the cowboys but he just stated that hes heading out to get a facelift and a case of metamucil.
TheCousinSal,"my 5 year-old son just told a joke that goes like this...

what is a ghosts favorite food?

spaghetti

sorry. he is really effing dumb."
TheCousinSal,and thats that. i would say i cant wait for pre-season to begin but im pretty sure we just saw it 6 months early. #superbowl53
TheCousinSal,hey steelers - you have 37 pro bowlers on offense. how about running a regular play vs. letting the upback take the fake punt play?!?!
TheCousinSal,i dont think ive ever seen 2 wrs get so wide open 10 yards behind the secondary. get yer head outcha a# percent  wade phillips.
TheCousinSal,fight of the year! let me go on record offering canelo my clean urine sample so that we can see this a 3rd time.  #gggcanelo2
TheCousinSal,huge game for victor oladipo. 30 points 12 boards and $600 billion dollar swing for bettors on a meaningless three at the buzzer. #gambling #nbaplayoffs2018
TheCousinSal,should you urge everyone not to jump on our bet of russ westbrook over 15.5 rebounds tonight or should i? never mind...you do it.  #gambling
TheCousinSal,shame on anyone who bet the dodgers on opening day at the ridiculous price of -310.  and by anyone i of course mean me. #baseballisback
TheCousinSal,im stunned by the perseverance of this loyola-chi team and that dick vitale has yet to refer to sister jean as a diaper dandy. #ncaatournament
TheCousinSal,patriots fans can be as confident as they want to be - but the look of concern on tom bradys face is alarming to me.
TheCousinSal,josh allen is smart - playing a good game but not lighting it up in a way that cleveland browns scouts will take notice. #potatobowl
TheCousinSal,i'd say 13 of the 1st 16 rds between kovalev + ward have been near impossible to pick. looking forward to an exciting ending #wardkovalev2
TheCousinSal,no one knows the ins and outs of the xfl like my friend  no one cares either - but read this if you enjoy money.
TheCousinSal,im very impressed with tyson fury here - but he were a true tyson hed tear whats left of wilders ear off with his teeth.
12Xpert,and change the law so that all new punters will know that they can only play for fun at such bookmakers not to win  professionally.
12Xpert,that is  what i'd like to know. we can measure it by number of sigma from the mean. hopefully  will give me that data soon.
12Xpert,that may prove to be his downfall. could be within 24 hours. he went all in and jc called him. high stakes. winner takes all.
12Xpert,"besides others have already showed that since going ""live"" the bets have failed over quite large samples. so what's the point of all of this?"
JambosPicks,"wow. lamar jackson and the #ravens put on a show in miami and our #balvsmia over 39 play is a winner! 

now about #dolphins +7..."
JambosPicks,thanks for reaching out! after paying  the $250 fee you would be +$3995.  you can also use our units calculator to see your expected profit/loss
JambosPicks,"this nolan arenado solo shot made #rockies-#cardinals a 7-3 game meaning the over 9.5 is a winner weather permitting.

 #gamblingtwitter"
mschwimer,thursday night props went 7-1!  now we need our game of the week to hit on sunday.  listen to hear our analysis of the game.
mschwimer,steve duncker was the chairman of nyra and personally did several deals with betfair. but its clear you didnt do your research on those names.
mschwimer,again if you think our picks are no good then you are the #1 person who should sign up! we are giving you ridiculous odds.
mschwimer,lebron stay on the floor arguing about calls instead of running back on d. its not like this is game 6 of the nba finals
mschwimer,i have decided to step my twitter game up and just got an hd hero 2  camera.  expect some sweet videos in the near future!
mschwimer,if i were in charge of mlb i would allow draft pick trades... its so much fun watching all these moves and all the stratigery
mschwimer,still training my ass off but im excited to take a break this weekend to go to joe savery's wedding... should be a good time
mschwimer,and what does  win? 2 tickets to the phils mets game and dinner and drinks after... cant wait to see what my 10000 follower wants
RufusPeabody,when you win betting small markets and props you get limited unfortunately. betting blatant errors and then crying foul makes us all look bad.
RufusPeabody,haha yes we have looked thoroughly. they brought me into the whole mess actually. michael claimed i endorsed their business model (i did not)
RufusPeabody,watching this video  it is  obvious to me now that harvard converts here if #84 on harvard doesn't whiff on his block. thanks bud.
RufusPeabody,mp now-cast with relevant components. the mp curr  year rank is  inseason rating (w/ priors only used to adjust in determining strength of opponent)
RufusPeabody,not trying to get into this again but i have to agree with  this is just another tout service doing typical tout service antics.
RufusPeabody,edge is really pretty meaningless in that context. i use edge and positive expected value synonymously and calculate them the way you're calculating ev.
RufusPeabody,in my years on #gamblingtwitter i have never seen a more unifying figure than  mike you have done what i thought was never possible.
RufusPeabody,so if you hit 59 percent  against -110 lines (which is 12.64 percent  roi) someone paying you 25 percent  of winners would still lose.
RufusPeabody,do you see the issue if you're using a line  that is  not available at a book that grades the way you are grading?
jeffma,jason witten just said these days in contrast to deshaun watson and dak... does he realize that was literally less than 3 years ago
jeffma,so 10 out of 10 on confidence? just trying to figure out how much of my life savings i'm going to wager on it
jeffma,it is  fair feedback. he does sell picks which i abhor. but i  daily fantasy sports  know him to be a liar or scammer
jeffma,touche but i  daily fantasy sports  really like my chances down 2-0 headed to toronto already having thrown darvish and hamels. question still stands.
SportsCheetah,in some bowl contests around these parts. i probably can't divulge the position i'd take on every game until i start 5-15 or something.
SportsCheetah,dolphins? still 43s around the market which is where i bet it at. 43.5 is fine if  that is  all you have access to.
SportsCheetah,i adjust my bet sizing. if your volume is fairly high i think 1-2 percent  is good but ultimately whatever you're most comfortable with.
SportsCheetah,this is the saddest thing ive heard in a long time. theres a gofundme to help the family with funeral costs if youre able.
SportsCheetah,bleh luke botched the moneyline going with corral for nearly 2qs but i'll take it. plumlee needs to just be the guy going forward.
capjack2000,i assume that is someone's kid that was up-front i considered blurring that part of the pic...however i didn't post that pic online originally.
capjack2000,good question. at this point itll be the sport that embraces it the most. right now the leader out of the gate is pga.
capjack2000,only if your credit card company permits the transaction. unfortunately all the major us credit card banks do not. ymmv with lesser known cards.
capjack2000,"they have kiosks where you can check the lines but not bet. it actually makes the situation even worse. 

cant make this stuff up."
capjack2000,i support the concept but theyre going to try to be like wip and take calls and itll be absolutely unlistenable at that point.
capjack2000,nj lottery not authorized to provide sports wagering. probably if the nj law was written now (instead of 2014) they'd lobby to be included.
capjack2000,no clarity as of yet. i was asking her to affirm or deny that the dge is the hurdle. no reply after 10 days.
capjack2000,"update nfl is now only two months away and still no nj sportsbooks have announced an nfl handicapping contest! 

worst fumble in nj since..."
capjack2000,"jay kornegay:the numbers we make in vegas are always geared towards the sharps. we book towards the sharps. we react to the sharps.
#bosamerica"
capjack2000,i blame joe peta...he puts out a book 6 years ago. 4 years later some guys read it and build top-down models from it.
capjack2000,absolutely correct  this is pure european influence. jay rood and the boys got hamstrung by management. mgm throwing away their brand in emerging states.
dinkinc,shouldnt  god bless america  be  god bless the world.  ?  kind of egotistical . maybe selfish.  also anti-atheist .. i call for a ban.
dinkinc,do you break it down before it goes in the box? i never have seen a colorless one. not sure i could do one.
dinkinc,wrestling is entertainment.  like movies .  5 dimes does book wrestlings big shows but i have no idea what you are trying to prove.
dinkinc,you can debate the political beliefs of the shooters after you take the assault rifles away from them   how fukkin hard is this ??
dinkinc,correctly knowing your edge.  may take years to get that right.  just because you have a model does not make it a good model
dinkinc,un-american has come to mean trying to work together for the good of the people....  if you are doing that you are now un-american
dinkinc,hey.... i once asked you about what if a horse had fallen during a no-change situation  and you mocked me... i accept your apology
robpizzola,"a kid threw a jolly rancher lollipop right back at me last year*

*he didnt but it would have made for a good story"
robpizzola,hard to imagine youll find a worse hockey line than the flyers being home dogs against oscar dansk for a couple of hours today.
robpizzola,at the very worst ben would be a pick'em over the course of a full season. i might even make him a small favorite.
robpizzola,"still tilted.

everyone crapping on gb offense after playing chi minutes and den defenses.

everyone praising gb defense after playing trubisky cousins and flacco."
robpizzola,i hope si is paying for all the cocaine  that is  needed to film these. christ not a single breath in that four minutes.
robpizzola,because  that is  an implied probability of 9.1 percent  and their true probability is closer to 15 percent  assuming fleury is healthy for playoffs.
RASPicks,question for nba market experts is it normal for a 1h playoff total to drop from 121 to 114.5 on day of game?  (clippers/gsw)
RASPicks,our 7 day  college basketball  service free trial starts today.  the best picks money can buy and you  daily fantasy sports  have to pay!
RASPicks,for the first time in 3 years the  college basketball  service will continue through march madness and  college basketball  totals will be included.  .co/z1necd66tp
RASPicks,if you tailed 565 santa clara +2.5 and are in the vegas area head to orleans and help give ras a homecourt edge. #gobroncos
RASPicks,started a ncaa/nit/cbi/cit play thread on the .co/lijtndf field goal k forum.  first play was 582 youngstown st -4 but number is mostly gone.
RASPicks,any +roi is good means you are winning!  2-3 percent  is fine for high volume.  the key is optimizing volume/win rates for max profit.
RASPicks,the 163.5 was widely available when i tweeted which was about 8:00am pst.  the totals tend to move a lot early in the season.
VegasRefund,"who is the best bet to be the fourth team into the # college football playoff?

(assuming 1-3 are bama clemson and notre dame)"
VegasRefund,daily fantasy sports  understand the tournament scheduling for today.. give us two stand-alone games during the day and then six on a sunday night.
ProfessorShine,id rather that dead money be in the market from bets.  plus pinas marketing nonsense dressed up as pro betting is never not hilarious
ProfessorShine,true. ive seen some relatively smart people create an incredible blind spot when it comes to sports betting. its like their brains turn off
ProfessorShine,i played tor for g1 and for series.  +ev arb vs dubs future. i think raptors win this thing  for what  it is  worth
ProfessorShine,my loose criteria is 150k bankroll.  but it is very flexible and i  wont argue for those who work with these or in groups.
ProfessorShine,sam should be happy with feedback.  it wasnt blind trolling.  sportsmemo is full of charlatans and should be avoided.  plus that trend is awful.
suuma810,dazu kommt dass die bengals zur pause schon eine siegwahrscheinlichkeit von 89 percent  hatten. 17 runs finde ich in dem spiel eher zu viel.
suuma810,"according to pff mitch trubisky has the second-lowest play-action rate among 37 qualified quarterbacks at 16.7 percent.

suuma810,gibt ja einige die der meinung sind mmc sei ein guter fang. ich bin jedenfalls froh wenn er nicht bei den jets landet ;)
suuma810,browns down to +1 -105 at pinny now opened +3 +102. markets buying into the brownies against a declining cincy team without aj green.
suuma810,no. prime example from last year: marshon lattimor and ken crawley were ruled out vs lar line didn't move during the first 12ish hours.
suuma810,i admit when i get lucky but i think broncos should have covered easily. they were the more efficient team and it wasn't close.
suuma810,biggest drops for the teams with the best qbs obviously. seahawks end up so low because i am not high on them (with wilson).
ClevTA,my god who cares. the minute this topic disappears from my timeline isn't a minute too soon. reporters need to stop asking about it

aluckyaday,the problem with minimum bet is it would be detrimental to recreational players. they would be able to offer fewer promotions and less markets.
aluckyaday,when it comes to sports betting i would say the opposite is true! to create liquidity you need to increase the number of losers.
aluckyaday,2-2. season now 26-19-3 (started week 2)  57.8 percent . infinite tipping monkeys would have this record or better 15.6 percent  of the time.
aluckyaday,"i think you will find that if you test the efficiency of pinnacle or cris vs the ""consensus"" they would come out on top."
aluckyaday,possibly available in their own accounts? assuming they are publicly listed somewhere and  daily fantasy sports  consolidate the results. probably too much to ask!
aluckyaday,unless of course you try and use this knowledge and only bet kambi when they are better then pinnacle. quick way to stake reductions.
aluckyaday,from who? boris? the labor party activist? or both? this is what uk politics has become. a battle of fake news. its very sad
aluckyaday,i will give the 13 percent  the benefit of the doubt and assume they did not see the recording of the defense secretary yesterday.
aluckyaday,if you want to maximize your bank growth you should be changing your stake size after every bet. but we had that argument yesterday!

EdMillerPoker,i would never have thought a sportsbook would build a marketing campaign around an overweight middle-aged mostly naked man i have much to learn
EdMillerPoker,ha. perhaps. but for now i think they're too busy pretending they have no idea where any of the money they receive comes from.

12Xpert,"my favourite ever blog post of yours. excellent account of why bookmakers shouldn't care about restricting ""winners"" even if none of us like that."
12Xpert,"yes  that is  correct but the inefficiency is minimal because the proportion of long term ""winners"" is tiny in comparison to the bettor population."
12Xpert,to reiterate because the method uses pinnacle's odds to measure 'true' probabilities  it is  methodologically impossible for value bets to be found at pinnacle.
12Xpert,that is  a bit like asking how long a piece of string is.  it is  subjective. depends where you set your statistical testing thresholds.
12Xpert,i'm simply asking you to prove what you say that the outcomes of punters' betting doesn't look a lot a random distribution. still waiting.

12Xpert,gambling is taxed. in the uk operators pay 15 percent  tax on profits made from uk customers irrespective of whether the operator is offshore.
12Xpert,i can't remember if we ever did a ttest on your actual v expected profits. i suspect yours will show a statistically significant difference.

all it needs now is a perfect ending."
JambosPicks,basketball is over but great news! we have baseball picks below. check out what games we are on with a full breakdown. #gamblingtwitter #baseballisback
mschwimer,thank you! our team is split. most r but some python. we found the most predictive modeling comes from machine learning techniques/random forest modeling.
mschwimer,it was. but will certainly take a 5-2 day +3.1 units. good to have a bounce back day after the awful week we had.
mschwimer,and yes. they are all available to anyone that registers. registering is free for everyone. so all prior plays are available to the public.
mschwimer,""" 4th of july competition

i will send a new racket to the person who tweets the most "" american "" picture."" love it"
mschwimer,i choose the alliance chronograph.  i felt like it was the best combination of classy and modern of all the watches i looked at
mschwimer,""" even with those patches of hair growing all over his facehe somehow got a hit go pence! #phillies"" gotta stay with what works"
mschwimer,random question. how many of you either invest your own money in the stock market or are interested in the stock market in general?
mschwimer,back on a plane... got an hour and a half to stay on twitter and answer and questions or just talk about anything... go!
mschwimer,you should be happy to know my mom wears all your jewelry and loves it. you can thank  for being a great sales woman
mschwimer,if s1 is a 95 and s2 is a 87 then s3 is a 98 s4 is a 99 and s5 is a 98
mschwimer,in that case i will be ready for any tweetup... my schedule is online... i will be in the bullpen every home game haha
RufusPeabody,new  podcast where  and i discuss nfl week 17 and how its a different animal. we also go over next mondays bowl games.
RufusPeabody,looking through fanduel and superbook apps the following are bets i really like: day 50/1 hatton 33/1 casey 150/1 matsuyama 80/1 simpson 25/1.
RufusPeabody,i honestly  daily fantasy sports  know all the details about this but i thought it was just a very public betting partner arrangement.
RufusPeabody,...and whats wrong with the industry! very happy for you to point me to the large number of ethical ones you are mentioning.
RufusPeabody,it is  similar to betting the haws to win the 18-19 nba championship if their roster was made up of middle school kids.
RufusPeabody,people who are allowed to fire big like this are most assuredly *not* sharps. they are rich businessmen who give big casino action.
jeffma,stay in your lane ted. rufus is entertaining us all right now. im waiting for a direct response from  to complete the circle
jeffma,no one talking about how beal and wall played 45 and 44 minutes respectively. fatigue plays a role in a game like this.
jeffma,lost in all this ridiculousness is the worst decision of all: billy donovan persisting in having waiters inbound the ball in critical times
jeffma,honestly i probably could if i wanted to take the time. that was a tough one but definitely not the worst i've seen
SportsCheetah,just about everyone on twitter could do what jrue did to saric if they were 1-on-1 against saric but it was still smooth.
SportsCheetah,most of it. still been a net negative outside of that game but a -46 in one game will swing things a little.
SportsCheetah,im on tv nearly every day would you like me to change me avatar to my face to relay the news i received?
capjack2000,yes they're live in iowa at catfish bend. they have a mobile app as well in iowa. you need to register in-person though.
capjack2000,oh hey! that jax/hou game is at a neutral vanue. the nfl is so international...playing a game in the middle of the pacific.
capjack2000,"i just realized this tweet got me blocked by john holden. 

catena should consider exiting social media...they are far too sensitive for this."
capjack2000,in college football where a side might be -34 and the total 55. yes very common. they see the same things you do.
capjack2000,"i think it was called ""dream season"" or something close to that. i've never found video of it either (but haven't really looked)."
capjack2000,ill be happy to no longer have to explain why sugarhouse online casino is in nj and the physical casino is in pa.
capjack2000,two people right there who helped advance the conversation of legalization. one via the public courts one via the court of public opinion.
capjack2000,when the host has an illness where survival is lined at +2000 i dont think marketing future hof matches is their biggest priority.
capjack2000,deceptive practices by books is what is getting old. if they dont want to get beat dont offer the wager. plain and simple.
dinkinc,do you have a chart for point spread and money line equivalents and how much does the total of the game matter ?
dinkinc,i  daily fantasy sports  think that should be part of the considerations of the track vet.... all horses should be judged the same
dinkinc,kings outshot flames 20-3 in the first period without the benefit of a power play. what kind of world are we living in?
dinkinc,it is  a pretty serious charge the president is making... he is the president so i am sure he will show us proof...
dinkinc,i just have to find a way to keep the charity alive .. message me your phone number.  not sure i have it
dinkinc,1-2    could have been better and could have been worse.... counting down the days until my first long break in over 20 years......
dinkinc,i am not sure how the vegas total dropped a full goal in just three games considering one of those games went over
robpizzola,these commentators are commending jim schwartz as if he had something to do with daniel jones not being able to handle the snap.
robpizzola,there's this thing called live betting nowadays. you should look into it instead of spending your time being a fucking idiot on twitter.
robpizzola,paulo i put down real money at a blackjack table with you playing as the anchor. you know that im a sick fuck.
robpizzola,you should really be mad at the people who watch similar shows to you that decided they were going to watch the i-land!
robpizzola,i steer clear of the awards stuff because i really have no idea what criteria voters are using to vote on this stuff.
robpizzola,forgot about that. i have so much disdain for boston sports that i cannot bring myself to cheer for them in any capacity.
robpizzola,daily fantasy sports  really have one if i'm being honest. go-to album for me right now is phanerozoic i: palaeozoic by the ocean.
robpizzola,today was the first game in 2019 that they played against one of the top 170 teams in college basketball. context is important.
RASPicks,ras  college football  is 18-13 (58.1 percent ) for +3.65 units y touchdown  and since 2009 366-257 (58.7 percent ) for +91.30 units.
RASPicks,if you can prove that we took a private offer on totals i'll run pregame banners on ras/bt for a year.  we didn't.
RASPicks,circled everywhere except pinny?  i'll have to disagree with you there.  guess we will wait for you to take out 6.5's next time.
VegasRefund,"college basketball  8-2

michigan +4 
clemson -4.5"
VegasRefund,"packers at jets opened with pack -3.5.. its since flipped to jets -1/-2

makes you question the status of aaron rodgers this week"
VegasRefund,i get nervous for the greater good of degen nation having access to live-betting when the warriors are ever losing (especially at halftime).
VegasRefund,the academy awards has nine nominees for best picture.. and i havent seen one. never even heard of any of them except dunkirk.
ProfessorShine,you need the players.  he doesnt have oregon players yet.  lost his qb the 2nd eagles season and had to win with...mark sanchez.
ProfessorShine,his response will be i dont bet with anon twitter trolls.   hes so awful at everything i cant imagine fs1 keeps him around.
ProfessorShine,amazing times. being on twitter 9years post years of free picks help new bettors with questions  never being banned is cowardly in  world.
ProfessorShine,limits matter.   small shitty offshores put out basically promo lines to attract business.  lv books including wg copy cris lines in every sport.
suuma810,the 3+ players has a sample size of 6 runs too. so there isn't really a real takeaway just based on those numbers.
suuma810,cool interview with  introducing the new  app that merges sports betting  social media. implementation of closing line value is also in their plans.
suuma810,"the houston #texans 2019 team preview has been posted for trial  premium members! 

deshaun watson  friends have some hurdles to overcome this year.."
suuma810,excellent read by    this is an evidence-based analysis quantifying  looking at both sides in the pass rush vs coverage discussion. lets get smarter.
suuma810,agreed. in some stages of the game their play calling was questionable. rams couldnt defend kamara throw him the ball every first down.
suuma810,the saints had three first down runs for a combined one yard. they also had one int but that was a punt too.
suuma810,exactly! if you bet the dog on the moneyline its a loss. on the spread its a push. difference between pushing and losing.
ClevTA,these were my 2017 mid-late round draft targets for the browns. some of these guys can play. maybe jimmy will read my resume
ClevTA,punting on 4th and 4 at the opp 39 with a shot to end the gm is not interesting at all its logical
ClevTA,felt like kc blitzed on every single down one sunday and he had no chance. do u have that blitz rate vs norms?
ClevTA,sorry with thanksgiving and other family stuff didnt have time to do it yesterday. ill have my nfl picks up in the morning
ClevTA,totally diff tho since browns are at home and dont have to deal with noise. also rams are dead last in pressures allowed
ClevTA,hard to know bc eagles have 4 tough games coming up in a row. if it was this weekend id say ne -3
ClevTA,the drop down from darius leonard to walker is something for the colts. i wonder what leonard is actually worth to the line
ClevTA,would be nice if gb could actually snap the ball wirh more than 1 second on the clock. my god this is awful
ClevTA,not really. once u get into the mid 40s im not sure i can feel too strong about an under in this nfl
ClevTA,hey  can u plz stop sending  winners. him being the worst sports bettor on earth is one of the favorite things about him
CizzlingSports,it legit is every other day except during football season when it is legit every single day that he says something dum dum
CizzlingSports,"hold on checking - ok the t'sc's still make it functionally prohibitive for any individual sub to ever enforce the $10k guarantee.

nbd."
CizzlingSports,i did it for the last 3 years nba playoffs. he wised up and made it practically impossible to track him this year.
spanky,i tweeted this cuz i heard some capper thinks im stealing his plays and i wanted to put a general message out there...
spanky,"this all sounds cool but none of these things mean anything.  

the only thing that matters is getting the best of the number..."
spanky,the crazy language of the wire act is it states business of betting which later had to be clarified (citations above)  as bookmaking.
spanky,exactly. your primary focus is media with betting being secondary. everyone knows this as you readily admit it. yet  still bans you!  unbelievable
spanky,the best bookmakers in the world welcome my action and use it to their advantage. the others however do get a little nervous
spanky,he wasnt betting solely for me but also for himself.  we were betting partners. i just had the lions share of the partnership.
spanky,here's a link to a tweet i posted a few weeks back on why i  daily fantasy sports  tout.  this point is covered
spanky,havn't had an account with you guys in years.  my lowvig limits got reduced to peanuts....  any shot of me coming back in?
spanky,happy valentines's day twitter heads.   daily fantasy sports  forget to tell your first ever valentine how much you love her - your mother.
spanky,this documentary aired a week after douglass defeated tyson. i find it fascinating how larry merchant is so bold with his tyson insults

PlusEVAnalytics,"taking into account the fact that a 16 seed has never beaten a one-seed (meaning your bracket should have four guaranteed wins)
noooooooo"
PlusEVAnalytics,if you cant estimate p then try harder to estimate p. my  article talks about a bayesian approach. this paper is quitter talk.
PlusEVAnalytics,true but thats extremely difficult to do - thats exactly why i try to stay on the side that benefits from it :)
PlusEVAnalytics,(i live in an area with very high jewish and asian populations so the 18-0 high school team is a hypothetical example obv)
PlusEVAnalytics,ive been in a similar situation. selling picks is not the answer. take on partners work for syndicates etc. but dont sell picks.
PlusEVAnalytics,(2/2) individual player + course combinations. could also correlate each component of skill mix with weather variables. thats how id approach it ymmv!
PlusEVAnalytics,i hope this creates an accounting burden that haunts your finance division like a bad case of herpes for the next 20 years.
PlusEVAnalytics,small play on dal/edm under -118 +2 percent  edge. 0-2 yesterday. y touchdown  11-12 +10.2 percent  roi (yay variance) +8.6 percent  bankroll growth.
PlusEVAnalytics,this moment of cold-hearted pragmatism brought to you by ontarios conservative government. their slogan should be were not wrong fucking deal with it.
PlusEVAnalytics,gotta give the man credit if i listened to him we would be in world war six by now was a good zinger.
aluckyaday,another example of how technology has changed things. what is wrong with a good old fashioned   singnal from a window in the bank
aluckyaday,betfair used to have them too but scrapped them. if i understand it correctly matchbook is not a pure exchange. it is seeded.
aluckyaday,funny how people are biased against shorter prices. guess its because you are more likely to be profitable by chance at larger prices.
aluckyaday,all gamblers want to win but they  daily fantasy sports  expect to. you have a healthy casino market. why is that any different?
aluckyaday,personally i would think nfl is king because it is the most popular sport and not really because of the mechanics of betting.
aluckyaday,$100 maxes you americans have not felt the full force of the european soft books yet. 1 or less is commonplace over here.
aluckyaday,they need volume but they also need to make +ev bets themselves to increase their profit margin. their traders have said as much.

joeytunes2,i think people are confused on what being pro bettor means. maybe  can do a podcast.  seems like everyone says they know them.
joeytunes2,just was rooting for the guy. i help didnt dive in without proven winning records.. i liked the dude wish he won. d
joeyisaks,because you cant gamble from stadiums but can from couch with 10 games on. and going to a game takes up all day
EdMillerPoker,whether someone is a winning sports bettor or not is entirely a function of how strong the trading is on the other side
EdMillerPoker,i expect most of the selfdriving testing to happen in china where there will be less.. uh.. friction in the politics of it
EdMillerPoker,continue to wonder why ppl who have stuff to lose and are in the potential blast radius are ignoring this guy but hey.
EdMillerPoker,every single person (bettor/book/exec/etc) i've come across has huge gaps in their understanding of the sports betting industry. less talking more listening imo.
EdMillerPoker,most in-play bets are on the final outcome of a game just like pregame bets and therefore require no special data to grade.
EdMillerPoker,the hedge fund manager who gives the $2-$5 players fits would be the best possible spot in a high stakes game. similar concept.
EdMillerPoker,rip al. you really meant something to a lot of people and thank you for sharing your gifts so generously with the community.
EdMillerPoker,not a response to anything specific that happened to me just a theme i keep seeing in the gambling crypto and tech spaces
EdMillerPoker,i think that environment will be very very hard on the lower market share books that also want to operate at hi margins

nonrandomalpha,you can be critical and still be a fan. smdh. the worst kind of fans are the sycophant breed. blind support is meaningless.
nonrandomalpha,why would kellen moore be incented to reveal anything creative or exploratory v the dolphins as a 22 point home favorite? vanilla playbook.
nonrandomalpha,i dont blindly or universally hate chalk - but putting seven super heavy favorites in a parlay just wouldnt be attractive to me.
nonrandomalpha,#fitzmagic would make wk1 +4.5 look a lot more attractive and the #ravens on the road as heavy chalk a non-starter for me...
LeeSharpeNFL,we can't. i think we're just gonna have to have to trade for a journeyman or (more likely) roll with trubisky in 2020.
LeeSharpeNFL,(obviously right before week 17 is the perfect time to do this. but hey i have more free time around the holidays soooooo.)
LeeSharpeNFL,"my model (which as you say doesn't understand a shoulder issue) has it at dal -0.3 the market is at dal -2.

*shrugs*"
LeeSharpeNFL,qb wins is a dumb stat but eli retiring with as many wins as  losses is still in play and this amuses me.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i believe it was pace himself that said this offseason ""if you're not getting better you're getting worse.""

he's certainly proven that point."
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  think  it is  insane to retain him but i would let him go. i expect him to be retained.
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah  it is  a challenge for sure. i need to play with it more to understand its impact. it could be useless signal.
LeeSharpeNFL,"at what point is it correct to take lamar jackson out of this game?

his style seems more injury-prone than the average qb."
LeeSharpeNFL,"awesome! thanks for making the cpoe and other stuff public. 

(and yeah i just source() a file with a bunch of functions too.)"
whale_capper,"breeders cup qa scope coming in 30 minutes...

whale_capper,tough to see how they lose their momentum at this point but hou will likely be favored in 4 of the next 5
whale_capper,what do you do with this roster? way too many guys that need minutes to develop and a 14-man rotation aint gonna work
whale_capper,i'm back to 1934 and even the st. louis gunners who only played 3 games and faced 52 pass attempts managed 3 picks
whale_capper,we might have to clip that 2 minutes and submit it to the hall of fame... i think every angle we supported hit
whale_capper,generally historical performance is irrelevant to the consumers of free picks... would guess they care 10x more that you have a current edge
whale_capper,deep dive in the us open...  breaks down his card and  gives us the course report live from pebble beach. incredible podcast enjoy!

AndyMSFW,if anything you should be able to throw a flag on duck for that pass.   that is  how you get your guys killed.
AndyMSFW,have you been to the one at the d?  there's no doors.   it is  just a little cubby next to the sigma derby.
AndyMSFW,i think there's an easy joke in there about kentucky-folk not having to worry about their teeth getting knocked out during the game.
AndyMSFW,yeah  it is  tough that two basement-dwellers with upside that i like reside in the same divisions as last year's super bowl teams.
AndyMSFW,happy father's day weekend to all the guys with weak pull-out game!  i'll be celebrating by grilling every meal until monday.  #surfnturf #chopon

JoeyKnish22,well. bad opener therefore correlates to large steam yes? not sure were disagreeing lol. and i believe cris opened a juiced 3 yes?
JoeyKnish22,you should worry about getting the boot from the bowl pool for calling it the wrong name before worrying about a middle here.
JoeyKnish22,why yes sir that sounds delightful. hope it lands 47 so the live bets cash and those sitting on 48 or higher lose.
JoeyKnish22,you have to assault a police officer while smoking marijuana as your committing the penalty for a missed dpi call to be overturned.
JoeyKnish22,yeah his career has kind of fluctuated between average and above average but hes probably playing at a top 5-7 level this year.
JoeyKnish22,"yes. i see your jokes in my mentions. 

no as a professional i will not stoop to that level and respond to them."

Ccon8181,listening to former georgetown coach john thompson call this #wichita #templetuff game on #espn2 is almost as painful as backing his gt team
Ccon8181,could anything be more #jetsvsjaguars then the game ending in a tie?? with both teams with plays looking like they're trying to lose.
Ccon8181,it is  arizona or nothing but hard to back them with the way this game is being called. plus their the inferior team.

ToddFuhrman,these are the games where the house doesn't want to calculate all the  live moneyline liability that what was out there tonight #gswvspor
ToddFuhrman,hope those folks spend a lot of time in churches synagogues or mosques praying for their bankrolls to withstand the test of time
ToddFuhrman,exactly if multiple people tell you they hate the bet before a game starts often times a sign of good things to come
ToddFuhrman,in a truly efficient market you'd be correct but when you account for juice and the take back it changes the probability here
TheCousinSal,hey duck hodges in case youre wondering this is the ravens second string defense. go ahead and do your thing whenever youre ready.
TheCousinSal,today i am thankful for oblivious pats fans who have the nerve to complain about other teams and their whining. shaky tripping! ahahahahaha
TheCousinSal,my cousin  taught me that its always best if the in-studio talent hates you. i think this puts me on the right path.
TheCousinSal,dont want to jinx things but its looking pretty excellent for the cowboys.  (whats wrong with you sal? shut your damn mouth already!!)
TheCousinSal,hard to believe in this day and age one team can have 17 made 3s...the other 6...and its still a one possession game.
TheCousinSal,earthquake in l.a. seconds before the  blow a 5 run lead to the  unfortunately - no reports of the bullpen being swallowed up.
TheCousinSal,3 straight weeks in the black for me on  and i lose again to  because of another bullshit nascar race. march madness everybody!!
TheCousinSal,the ncaa playoff committee had better take a good hard look at the citadel - no college football analyst in america right now
TheCousinSal,of course i did - but if i give out -6.5 this am people will scream bloody murder. no matter...cheatriots in a rout.
TheCousinSal,only draymond green can pluck an opponents eyeball out of his head and then stomp around in disbelief at the foul call. #cavswarriors
TheCousinSal,tough dilemma for the houston crowd. if theyre too loud they run the risk of waking durant from his slumber. good lord. #game7
TheCousinSal,many have paraded through flushing over the years but michael conforto may very well be my favorite sub .200 hitter of all-time. #lgm
TheCousinSal,another complicated thought - good things seem to happen when you make your free throws and layups. more hard-hitting analysis to follow. #finalfour
TheCousinSal,i hate to disappoint everyone but my buzzer beater bet was for the thurs/fri games only. even im allowed to win sometimes. #ncaatournament
TheCousinSal,just witnessed a table split their $18 restaurant bill 6 ways. and none of the diners were even close to 93 years-old. sad!
TheCousinSal,i get sick to my stomach watching this. and yet i cant wait until sunday for it to happen all over again. #meateataday
TheCousinSal,wow - that 3rd and 1 hand off call from shotgun to your rb with no momentum is a bad one urban meyer.
TheCousinSal,i do. and it does not. explanation is that the change in temp. causes the alert. 67 degrees in la = chaos. #$grab
TheCousinSal,that is  right! brother bri's winning parlay was 7 teams. not 6. i  daily fantasy sports  count the unc fade pick. 2 easy.
TheCousinSal,incredible how the cavs tanking the final week of the regular season and blowing the 1 seed didn't make a shred of difference.
TheCousinSal,that creep  started 5th stringer bilal powell (16pts) vs me. this is exactly why everyone wants to boot him from our fantasy league
TheCousinSal,2 is a substantial amount. how many divisions will be won by less than 2 games? almost all of them. enough of you!
TheCousinSal,my week 11 recap on  + a chance 2 win a trip 2 vegas if your fantasy lineup beats mine. hint: it won't
TheCousinSal,a lot of bravado was set aside when taysom hill's backup decided to commit to another season but i'm glad he ultimately did.
12Xpert,never a good look calling people thick. a bit like members of broad church political parties calling dissenters scum and fascists. self defeating.
12Xpert,prices aren't that incorrect which implies bookmakers know how to make lines and hence then must be modelling them. if in doubt ask
12Xpert,what i am describing is the underlying neurochemical explanation for why people (all people) are motivated to gamble in some form or another.
12Xpert,the solution is if you know he's people think he's suspect you walk away and find someone else who isn't accused of cheating.
12Xpert,thats not something ive ever argued for nor would i. there was a referendum. parliament voted in large numbers to respect the result.
12Xpert,you haven't read my 'theory'. read it and then if you still think it doesn't add up come back and we'll debate it.

mschwimer,to be clear i calculate roi by amount invested/profit.  i do not calculate it as amount wagered/profit because that simply makes no sense.
mschwimer,only 1 play per week aka the game of the week. all other podcast picks are props. we dont post props on .
mschwimer,yes! watch the real vision interview. i literally go over it exactly step by step why we are doing what we are doing.
mschwimer,thank you. i really appreciate that! will be sure to let you know if rufus agrees to have a professional convo about this.
mschwimer,agreed. will continue to be fully transparent and answer all questions. just instead of my twitter we use  twitter. same transparency new location.
mschwimer,its been a bad start in  college football . thats for sure. however i am sure you understand the idea of sample size.
mschwimer,yes. this is more accurate. i am so used to saying subscribers. i need to do better and say registered users. thank you.
mschwimer,correct. if you are +1 unit you will be profitable after paying our fee. please read up on how our system works at
mschwimer,it does not require trusting me at all. it requires trusting bill miller marvin bush david ganek and steve duncker. look them up.
mschwimer,it is  finally here!  the best baseball glove in the world can be purchased via direct order for the first time ever.  (1/3)
mschwimer,i just checked on my comp... i couldnt see anything past 2013 either... looks like u r gonna have to get creative haha
mschwimer,ill give u 50 bucks. but you have to get everything from 2010 on. and write the date when each question was asked
mschwimer,of all the people i follow you are tweets r the most consistently on point. although you are twitter handle should be #smocktown
mschwimer,i think u should throw as many rackets as possible to get it out of your system then never throw another one again
mschwimer,i like the start of dexter so far... entourage sucks... homeland is like  big time potential but not sure where its going yet
mschwimer,not true... i will go through my followers list and randomly pick from there... if u already follow me u r already entered
mschwimer,do the current pigs have more players drafted by the phillies or have at one point been a member of the pirates organization?
RufusPeabody,"because i dont want to go broke. process  outcome.
congrats to the guy on his wins. hoping he quits while hes ahead."
RufusPeabody,i still have to engage what daniel kahneman calls system 2 to figure out whether fcs is the good one or not
RufusPeabody,for anyone who's been to burning man: what's something you'd really regret not bringing that isn't on all the checklists? first-timer here.
RufusPeabody,thats like saying imagine statistics can beat the market. regression analysis has made me lots of money. great tool for answering questions
RufusPeabody,every tout that messages me tells me theyre part of the 1 percent  of touts that provide value. what are the odds?!
RufusPeabody,love the idea. the problem is cost. there are a ton of sites and even more play types and they're not cheap.
RufusPeabody,so is that the burden of proof here? not that they're working together to make sure the lineups  daily fantasy sports  overlap.
jeffma,the king of props my parter and friend  aka dufus peabody shares some knowledge about betting props on the latest episode of
jeffma,by that logic teams should try to run fewer plays each game also since they dont have an infinite amount of plays
jeffma,latest episode of  follow  as he bets futures in vegas teaches  how to do math and teaches me about the english language
jeffma,i know fixing happens but you are grasping at straws here. i can't believe you legitimately think harden was compromised last night
jeffma,i honestly  daily fantasy sports  even understand what that means. you get paid for baseball analysis. why would you have save britton?
jeffma,i would have had the bears plus points and under.  but i wish i could always declare 25 minutes into game :)
SportsCheetah,was a great play to save  touchdown  and only lose 15 yards. db knew it did what he had to do etc.
SportsCheetah,settebello was in utah really like that spot  it is  never really crowded at the one here either flys under the radar.
SportsCheetah,per  today marks the first time in franchise history that the heat had multiple players with a triple-double in the same game.
SportsCheetah,lonzo 34 percent  on wide-open 3s last year and russ 32 percent . lonzo 50 percent  this year russ 25 percent .
SportsCheetah,right those seem like more viable points than past games h2h vs. a ville team under a different regime with different players.
SportsCheetah,martin the hero (for now) but freese placing one nice and easy oppo shift was a hell of an ab as well.
capjack2000,theyve done well with fanduel in nj. fds server issues on big volume days may or may not be gan related though.
capjack2000,as a participant in the contest he could not bet on it in nj if nj were to legalize wagering on it.
capjack2000,i once had a girlfriend who would say nice things about other guys to make me jealous and step up my game.
capjack2000,i noticed  now allows you to view lines and odds without logging in. good move. overdue but at least  it is  done.
capjack2000,i will gladly be the one to pay exorbitant license fees and high taxes if im allowed to be the only one.
capjack2000,very good interview with  on this week's gwae. a lot of broad practical advice that applies to every level of sports bettor.
capjack2000,id like them to cite their examples. im unaware of another league that gives information to sportsbooks ahead of the general public.
capjack2000,in other words very similar to the amount mgm resorts used to pay per year for plastic straws before they eliminated them.
dinkinc,i am having the same issues with hazel though not so extreme... pain meds....fish oil.... and pet releaf cbd has really helped...
dinkinc,candice and chuck taylor have to be on the list.. claudio as welll.  i would replace the last three with these three.
dinkinc,it is  now more of a minus than a plus.... i am a +ev kind of guy...  thanks for the kind words
dinkinc,[free match] a-kid vs zack sabre jr (triple with championship) - total rumb...  via     this is very entertaining... takes place in spain
dinkinc,i think you are trying to do the impossible.....   easiest race to pass for me but now i have a rooting interest
robpizzola,after watching all the star wars movies again i can definitively say that spaceballs is the best movie in the entire series.
robpizzola,3 bets on them 7 against them this season. 5-5 in those games for an roi of 1.7 percent . i'll live.
robpizzola,all things considered this was an awful showing from will grier today. colts secondary in shambles and completely unable to take advantage.
robpizzola,watching the euro 2020 draw... i dont know what it is about these draws but theyre more entertaining than the tournaments themselves.
robpizzola,i truly find it shocking that the patriots would get a call like that at home in a close game. truly shocked.
robpizzola,murray is definitely short because hes holding the ball behind him but nfl referees have no spine so this aint getting reversed.
robpizzola,couturier gotta be the most underrated player in the league. i dont think the average hockey fan realizes how good he is.
robpizzola,took a real hit to their forward depth and their goaltending is still an abomination. i think 95 is a fair number.
robpizzola,would much rather ceci 4.5 for 1 year than zaitsev 4.5 until 2024. dubas just continues to undo all of lous mistakes.
robpizzola,i think the point was that joe harris at his price tag is much more valuable than klay at his price tag.
robpizzola,"just asked customer service why my flight has been delayed twice.

response: ""the plane is broken"".

at least he was honest lol"
robpizzola,i  daily fantasy sports  understand how any blue jays fan can be upset with acquiring assets for kevin pillar at this point.
RASPicks,it is not only false but would mean we've hit over 59 percent  on our last 500 plays despite releasing worse numbers?
RASPicks,just have to give incentives to the market makers enough so someone will set a market big enough for the small bettors.
RASPicks,that is  what i thought.  and yeah that makes a ton of sense.  i'm sure you bet just the games we lose.
RASPicks,we only have nfl preseason up for now.  5 plays already released.  25 plays left to be released.  prorated price is $1045.
RASPicks,again  it is  just a baseline and a fairly clean/straightforward way to keep a record that can be easily evaluated by all.
RASPicks,haven't seen anything below -3 since this morning.  i wish we could play into overnight numbers but we wait for mature market.

ClevTA,when i used to constantly take texas tech overs in the 80s even then i never would imagine mahomes would become this
ClevTA,no idea why v tech just scored right there. take a knee and force a miami to then kick try and score

LeeSharpeNFL,colts should go for it obviously. i think i try for the first more than the  touchdown  though. still have a timeout.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm not sure why the series_success data isn't there. did you comment that out because of the running time from last time?
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah i was kind of confused by that too. is the idea that trubisky is bad supposed to be a conspiracy theory?
whale_capper,depends how much pull the big xii has in the committee this year but if thats what happens you nailed the rationale
whale_capper,he has a lot of leverage over million but im not sure he gets that deal elsewhere... bucks are in a pickle
whale_capper,i guess we finally have an answer to what happens to the human brain after a lifetime of drinking southern maryland wine
whale_capper,i guess with it being a two-way market they throw /participate in there so they wont have to pay juicy no plays?
whale_capper,dont hate it favorite look will be 2h under if we see 110-115 in the fh and they hang an inflated number
AndyMSFW,he's been taking a pretty bad team on a wild ride in fantasy this season.  hope we see him one more week.
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  really follow the uk politics but i did find this handy election guide in case you live there:
AndyMSFW,"going to be grabbing some positions today.  starting with one  that is  on the move a bit.

tampa/indy under 48.5 -105 (lowvig)"
AndyMSFW,"deep in my heart i hope that andrew luck is just gonna do a ""bruce arians"" and we see him back someday."
AndyMSFW,there's also the question of the usefulness of referencing an exchange that most of the listeners  daily fantasy sports  have access too.
AndyMSFW,"weary masses huddled around power outlets thinking about returning to the real world.  

 it is  real grim here in the d concourse."
AndyMSFW,lines are finally dropping for the tournies that start this week.  meac tonight mac early tomorrow with sunbelt and swac to follow.
AndyMSFW,"yesterday finished up 7-2 
only one play today:

unc-wilmington +11 -105 (5d reduced)

mac and meac outright bet articles out later today"
JoeyKnish22,i dont think hes fully healthy. was pretty ineffective last week. maybe better/improved this week but not willing to wager on him.
JoeyKnish22,well i dont think a lot of people had confidence to tail that considering you couldnt even spell the team name right.
JoeyKnish22,darren forgot to ask earlier. what size shirt? was gonna say medium but look like youve put on a few lately. large?
JoeyKnish22,i think army just jumped offside to fuck with the snap to cause a fumble and would have gotten away with it.
JoeyKnish22,i like where jaes heads at and this account is a few more lsu wins away from turning into nonstop burrow propaganda.
JoeyKnish22,somebody cant get enough b1g ten power football kool aid  i know whats coming next! laying it with jimmy and heisman shea!
TheKostos,there's an argument to be made  it is  the best sw movie.  it is  probably 2nd to empire but  it is  close
TheKostos,he's obviously never been an adonis (hasn't had to be) but this is ridiculous. he's legit fat and coming off elbow surgery
TheKostos,"right now on   is giving out nfl combine winners.

yes you read that correctly.

combine prop bets right now including 40-yard-dash times:"
TheKostos,and a great opportunity to have fun on a live broadcast instead of acting like youre reporting live from the jfk assassination
TheKostos,spend a shit ton of money at  and  this week and proud to announce the musical performances paid for all of it
LockyLockerson,. can you recap all your nfl bets real quick so i can put in the fade parlay after your 100-0 saturday
LockyLockerson,time to watch lsu alabama in a dark hole and forget anything else that happened or is about to happen today.   cheers!
LockyLockerson,monday overnight nba projections/analysis now available at the patreon page.  6 games on the schedule plenty of dicey injury news to decipher.
LockyLockerson,if miami goes to 8.5 -110 may play atlanta small just not sure we can say that butler is definitely this valuable.
LockyLockerson,on the show friday i think  was trying really hard not to say you are an idiot for betting on this team
LockyLockerson,haha i know i'm not betting either side tbh i rode baylor basically for a month and despise this situation for them
LockyLockerson,how on earth does the telecast not show a replay of the play at the goal line?!?!!! who cares about 4th down???
LockyLockerson,den sea: another home dog that shouldnt exist under this theory.  sea +2.5 -110 to win 1x and +125 for another 1x
LockyLockerson,i mean sure his knowledge of mental health is basically subzero and thats dangerous but the guy yells website names!! dot commmmm
LockyLockerson,only 3 things i want here: detroit cover deebo samuel mvp and for my wife's buffalo chicken dip to turn out ok
LockyLockerson,want to think friday night ivy basketball for reaffirming my belief that closing line value can eat a bag of dicks sometimes

DannyParkins,"35 x 3 / 98 = 1.07 points per shot attempt 

12 x 2 / 26 = .92 points per shot attempt"
DannyParkins,the eddy piniero experiment is officially over. i'm glad matt nagy didn't want any more yards for him a few weeks back.
DannyParkins,am i going to tweet out the bad boys trailer every time a new one comes out? why yes yes i am.
DannyParkins,richie you should hear what cdot says to me about him off the air. thinks dude is a product of the system.
DannyParkins,and i'm always available to eat deep dish or italian beef live on air for you guys  that is  what friends do

Gingfacekillah,never replace - the model is updating ratings as they move up and down over the season. simply add to the bottom.
Gingfacekillah,thanks! i  daily fantasy sports  have an excel based odds scraper. python is generally the way to go for that task imo.
Gingfacekillah,this test is for a player prop model that forecasts mean points scored for over under wagers. i was leaning towards mae.
Gingfacekillah,21 3pm. what are you going to do right. with their normal 3p expectation mia -1.5 cashes. it is what it is.
Gingfacekillah,no zach lavine for chi no bruce brown for det. total likely to go under now. not much value there either way.

logan_matthews9,toronto beat chivas in mexico so thats a really weird point to make here. lafc is significantly better than they were too
logan_matthews9,oh thats almost certainly the right choice. im just in a constant search of something different/more interesting much to my employers chagrin
logan_matthews9,if only there was a centralized figure who was in charge of things like discipline that could be held accountable for this...
logan_matthews9,just snagged burrow +1200 at betonline. not a huge fan of these markets typically but most places have him +500 to +750
logan_matthews9,and rufus would tell you that since the market doesnt respect your bets you dont have the edge you think you do
logan_matthews9,okay  - you can turn this around. step 1 put a 64 on the board today and lets get to the weekend
logan_matthews9,... if he gets the max. i think he probably will but it sure seems like hes not getting it from charlotte
PikachuBets,"12/14 ivy  college basketball  #nerdball

308307 princeton -2.5
309307 princeton -1 1h

season: 15-15-1

gotta hedge against potential 2h princeton collapse smh"
PikachuBets,cant. not even close. tos strips client of all legal recourse and forces arbitration only with an arbitrator appointed by jumbo dick
PikachuBets,this is actually impressive. the total score is correct but somehow all of the 2q points have been attributed to 3q instead.
PikachuBets,i do not know  about everyone else but i for one am ded and did not survive that  what the fuck fffffffff
PikachuBets,is he named for how gigantic his balls are so that they just dangle all day long as he swings them around
PikachuBets,looooooooool what if you just worked that hard for yourself and actually spent your time on betting your own fucking plays omggggggg
PikachuBets,"you: wow rufus you can get so much down im jealous

also you: betting online is a pita bc theyre all ponzis"
PikachuBets,jfc only day 3 of wnba regular season and im already looking at a huge polish middle. might have a gambling problem
PikachuBets,youre an idiot if you think others cant do this just bc you cant. p.s. dougs still not gonna fuck you bro
PikachuBets,lol following his dream to be a professional tout. wow! what a lofty dream what a stand-up guy what a model citizen.
adamchernoff,to an extent. i would say his solid 18 year track record before between college and pro go a long way though.
adamchernoff,i didnt say that was the case for me rating kc higher i asked the original poster how he rated that result...
adamchernoff,if it is white that means there is insufficient pitcher data for one or both teams. 30 starts are required to qualify.
adamchernoff,betting it quite heavily each weekend myself. but for pinnacle i am covering copa do brasil liga mx and peru each week.
Ccon8181,in todays nfl you always catch these backdoor with multiple plays inside the 5. not today with #panthers ... that one hurt
Ccon8181,"looking to build on a nice 2-0 day yesterday. no surprise here.. 

#jaguars +3.5 -110 

fade or follow but respect the #skininthegame"
Ccon8181,very true! posting a ticket or screenshot would eliminate any doubt about if the person really got in at the said number.
Ccon8181,wow if you had #bostoncollege full game +24 stay away from sharp objects. #duke ran them out of the gym 2nd half
Ccon8181,you know #nfl wants rams chiefs super bowl bad! the officiating reflected that in game one. lets see about this #kcvsne game
Ccon8181,"sportsbetting fund 

 investment  

#browns +6.5 risking 3.3 percent 

and

#niners +10.5 risking 3.3 percent 

 selective sides

46-52 season to date -32.3 percent"
Ccon8181,kids these days will never realize bsck in the day it took balls to go over the middle and make a catch.
Ccon8181,#louisville vs #fsu is a matchup of the most dysfunctional athletic but underperforming teams.both execute at 0 b-ball iq to close games
Ccon8181,#nfl such a poor product... more blowouts and favs covering large spreads. lucky to have passed on browns jets and ninners today.
Ccon8181,"this pkay just missed the cut for the fund. on it personally. #freepick 

#georgia #bulldog +3.5 

# college football ootball #sportsbetting #tennvsuga"
Ccon8181,new investors have taken advantage of 0 performance feeswhich won't be in place until september.minimum investment will rise from 1.5k to 5
Ccon8181,todd at the current fund goal of 2mil in advisement. it is  not unrealistic to produce realistic returns and not encounter limits
Ccon8181,sorry effort by #sooners .. embarrassing for them and #ncaa .. games just  daily fantasy sports  mean anything to these kids anymore.
kellyinvegas,im sorry. that loss to south carolina is worse than ous loss to kstate baylors loss to ou  utahs loss to usc.
kellyinvegas,lol i always tell my bf he looks like him. and no. women love to set themselves up for failure with athletes/stars.
kellyinvegas,we spoke about this on  on tuesday. auburn is the side we both like. today  said the books will need auburn big.
kellyinvegas,its actually the red that wore off on the yellow from being in the box. but thats funny. i always use blue
kellyinvegas,if you watch  i get more time to talk. social media is tough when they give you :45 for 6 games. lol.
kellyinvegas,i liked them early in the week. wont get to the window on with them. but interesting teaser potential through 3  7
kellyinvegas,i am? lol where was this bet prior to kick? i have two dimes on the game. yet im scared of $500
ToddFuhrman,im used to taking shit when i lose but asking for an apology on a 6-2 win is a new one bryan
ToddFuhrman,just heard joe burrow compared to jared goff on a pregame show...i'm not sure if  that is  a good or bad thing
ToddFuhrman,amazing you work with a guy for over a year and then   totally becomes a diva too good to make picks on
ToddFuhrman,one of my personal favorites and i think among maybe a handful that payne and i actually agree on over the years
ToddFuhrman,he was indeed my pick but for 1st  touchdown  on  but anytime scorer on  so while not the bonanza a nice result
ToddFuhrman,"pros vs joes nfl week 4

video: 

y touchdown  records and week 3 results

pros (5-21): lions  ravens 
joes (7-1): rams  patriots"
ToddFuhrman,the bears and broncos extra point might be the most bizarre sequence ive seen in some time where the line closed 1.5/2
ToddFuhrman,would you trust a man that looked like this to dispense gambling picks with any level of credibility? i didnt think so
ToddFuhrman,ha yep  daily fantasy sports  watch many but  that is  on the list along with billions suits and a few random others
ToddFuhrman,full disclosure larry i tried to do that and payne threatened me with bodily harm so i finally came to my senses
ToddFuhrman,indeed all win totals are only for 12 regular season games (or 13 where applicable) but not bowls or conference title games
ToddFuhrman,always get weird stuff happening in a 1 day sample size but everything evens out over the course of a full season
ToddFuhrman,it makes the west mildly intriguing but the only drama i see this year is in who comes out of the east
TheCousinSal,holy crap! stipe!  had the match in hand but those massive body blows that set up a great finish for  tremendous fight.
TheCousinSal,three years off and still as relentless a son of a bitch as youll find in the octagon.  good job by you
TheCousinSal,i turned away from the golden state game for 10 minutes.  what the hell happened? aside from the nba being the nba?
TheCousinSal,the ravens offensive play-calling suggests that they currently have enough points to win this game. i for one dont think they do.
TheCousinSal,congrats to all of the adoring ny giants fans. your teams plans to draft a qb has been pushed to april 2023.
TheCousinSal,im okay with a draw - except for the part where the ref couldve counted to 35 while fury was down. #yesihadtheunder
TheCousinSal,this is your week travis! i dont understand whats going on here.  i may have to head to london to reboot.  .
TheCousinSal,the bills are currently covering the spread by 32.5 points and yet i still feel its 50/50 that the +16.5 holds up.
TheCousinSal,who are we kidding? the browns will lose (and blow the cover) by 6 in ot.  but lets all watch anyway. #pitvscle
TheCousinSal,remember the time david stern blocked the chris paul to the lakers trade because it upset the competitive balance of the league?ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
TheCousinSal,fantasy update: heading into the 4th quarter im up 8 points on  he has drake and cooks. live line ...sportsish guy -175.
TheCousinSal,"let me go ahead and get this out of my system and into your bank accounts...
bills +2.5 (sal special)
pats -4.5"
12Xpert,one suspect that the methodological nuances contained within will escape the wit of the typical  journalist who's mission is simply to sensationalise.
12Xpert,if you're nearly 3 million up by the time bet365 drop your custom then consider yourself a very smart and lucky winner.
12Xpert,"no but i'll start now.

""should you put money into a betting fund?
no!!!""

 that is  all that needs to be said."
12Xpert,"extra leagues weekend results data added.
extra leagues midweek fixtures available (poland  usa).
main leagues midweek fixtures available (england  spain).
wocs available."
12Xpert,really fabulous debate about gambling. always pays to be able to refer to evidence based research when making moral judgements about it.
12Xpert,"love that fact that twitter blocked the image as ""may contain sensitive material."" 

are the joining the anti-gambling moral crusade now too?"
12Xpert,not to worry i've got a couple of seasons of data form github. i'll get to it in the next few days.
JambosPicks,picks are in! purchase a 1- or 4-week package at  today to see this week's plays and be eligible for our guarantee.
JambosPicks,"go to  register for free and click ""buy now"" to see our package prices and guaranteed payback if we are down units."
JambosPicks,oh cruel irony: dawel lugo launches a 5th inning  hour and both our under 5.5 (f5) and #tigers (f5) plays go down.
mschwimer,yes. 4 weeks for $900. if we lose you get $2000 back (including fee). its getting to be our most popular package.
mschwimer,i can. but then im yelled at for being a shitty tout! its better for people to see it for themselves imo
mschwimer,we believe. and our track record indicates a 6 percent  edge. and that is over 2500 plays that have been publicly available.
mschwimer,we use the market consensus line. so are you saying when we post a line the world wide market will instantly move?
mschwimer,picks are free for everyone at .  podcast picks are an unsustainable 30-8 right now. overall ncaa record is 833-590 (+175.7 units).
mschwimer,espn's daily wager starts tonight! excited to join the show a week from today. #freepicks are up on  right now. #gamblingtwitter #bettingtips
mschwimer,"way more of an insult to lambert.  is crock the all time saves leader in the acc?

he is a warrior though"
mschwimer,"how about erik ""bushes"" kratz tonight... just going off hitting balls into the bushes and throwing people out on his knees #bushes"
mschwimer,my girl  has started a blog about fitness and nutrition ... if u care about those things check out .co/gj touchdown ml4o
mschwimer,had so much fun at choooch's charity event to support local philly kids going to college.  and i bowled a 176  #illtakeit
mschwimer,"""  the guy who played omar is now on boardwalk empire!"" i know... i cant see omar being anyone besides omar though"
RufusPeabody,yes very different. i  daily fantasy sports  care about explaining effect on winning that game. i care about predicting future games.
RufusPeabody,i have that scenario only occurring in 0.6 percent  of sims so s touchdown  error in those numbers is relatively high
RufusPeabody,seems like a reasonable and respectful question to me. schwim only taking questions via dm. someone want to send it along?
RufusPeabody,that sounds about right actually. im guessing ill have it in the low 20 percent s when i run simulations tmw
RufusPeabody,the problem is i'll be in spain for the next 10 days. i need to be able to do this online.
RufusPeabody,re-read the wording of my original tweet. british open is considered a european tour event ( that is  the primary tour).
RufusPeabody,in the last week ive met two people with dogs named rufus one with a rabbit named rufus and now this.
RufusPeabody,wander around the center city. get lost (easy with the city layout) but not too lost that you miss your flight
RufusPeabody,i was making the point that it becomes a bigger and bigger issue because of low limits and banning winning bettors.
RufusPeabody,"which is more likely to occur:
(a) romo wins byron nelson
(b) romo struck by lightning during week of byron nelson"
RufusPeabody,that 300/1 seems off market. dropping from 300/1 to 20/1 based on an 18-13 start doesnt make a ton of sense
RufusPeabody,do people pay other people to tell them which buttons to press on the slot machine?  that is  what i'm against.
RufusPeabody,i remember when he told me cville would eventually be his biggest group of supporters. looks like that dream has died.
jeffma,"i wrote this for  last night. keep in mind it was late and it was post ""enjoying"" an incredible super bowl."
jeffma,i might go small with dlee for bogut and iggy for hb. they aren't getting boards with bogut in there anyways
jeffma,guess  it is  settled then. brady didn't do it. belichick didn't do it. must have been the cold weather. case settled.
SportsCheetah,my one piece of advice in 2020 is if youre working in the music industry writing songs performing etc.  watch songland.
SportsCheetah,3 defenders go to harden 37-feet away and they inbound it to harden with 1.2 secs left down 3. thabo man.
SportsCheetah,no it isnt if they dont meet requirement for games played or finish season etc. theyre no action win or lose.
SportsCheetah,anybody have a hypothetical live line thought for cards-braves if st. louis went the rest of the way pitching position players?
SportsCheetah,"1) pelicans-hawks at 4:30 today 

2) dodgers-nats

3) yankees-twins

4) san martin-comunicaciones mercedes 

5) the church video for fhe

6) browns-49ers"
capjack2000,this pic of the crowd watching the first legal sports bet being made in new hampshire pretty much sums it up.
capjack2000,"#infographicmonday here's an infographic sure to offend some. 

inspired by california's sportsbetting bill supported by the tribes which excludes mobile betting."
capjack2000,it really has become largely unplayable...and the commas persist! i dont understand how some of the operators are so tone deaf.
capjack2000,"looks like mississippi is going to eat new jersey's (and nevada's) lunch. 

mattress mack will make his big bet in ms."
capjack2000,when you attempt to bet $10/pt and they restrict you to $2.50/pt you realize why they didn't call them action points.
capjack2000,here's a good monday read...if you're like me you might need to read it several times to comprehend it. nice work
capjack2000,hey  i noticed i had to agree to new terms  conditions today at login can you summarize what those changes are?
capjack2000,hmmm...i have it on good authority they were being mindful of their liability on barkley. $5 max was told to many.
capjack2000,if you have action on the hounds division of the westminster dog show - hard rock ac sportsbook has you covered.
capjack2000,they're going to get a kid straight out of college. after all what's cooler for a 20-something than working for espn?
dinkinc,1-2 for the   1-1 mlb   0-1 ncaa football... i am pretty sure i have seen enough college football for this season
dinkinc,thanks.  thats very kind.   i lost two friends i really respect do to my anti-trump tweets.  i can handle the trolls
dinkinc,me too.... if i thought about it he had to have quads...i  daily fantasy sports  take enough time at the table
robpizzola,just looked at my edges for bowl games this year and i might just sleep through the entire bowl season fml
robpizzola,the steelers down two touchdowns with four and a half minutes left naturally just took a delay of game penalty lol
robpizzola,the best part about today is that there arent enough late games for me to lose all of my money back.
robpizzola,could potentially win 2 bets... or could potentially lose 2 bets on the outcome of this play. gotta love this shit.
robpizzola,from a pure entertainment standpoint (removing my displeasure with juve for being trash) this is best #ucl that i can remember.
RASPicks,reminder get all week 1  college football  plays from ras for free.  sign-up here:  .  three plays already released this morning.
RASPicks,one play was hit by another group before release had nothing to do with us.  didn't see any leaks at release.
RASPicks,that is just one step.  you also have to automatically publicly display every pick 10 minutes after start of each game.
RASPicks,would never encourage people to play against closing lines (ras their own stuff etc.)  goal is always to beat closing lines.
RASPicks,actually  posted on my forum that he doesn't move lines as much as ras.  wish he archived his plays  tracked clv.
RASPicks,kent st money is another example.  hard to adjust teams down much at week 7 that were already rated so poorly.
VegasRefund,"nfl comeback poy odds via 

who you got?

not a fan of leveon qualifying for this let alone the 2nd favorite."
VegasRefund,took the bait and its probably a trap.. but i cant live with passing up something like this and it hitting.
VegasRefund,unfortunate to lose the last  college football  bet of the year.. but it was a great season. recap it all tomorrow.
VegasRefund,every time i see chris tillman scheduled to pitch i assume it will be his last.. and then  it is  not.
VegasRefund,took tony finau not to make the cut at +200... maybe hell try and give it a go with that ankle.
VegasRefund,for what  it is  worth  figuring out rb touches for the pats is one of the hardest things to do period.
ProfessorShine,percentage of extra points being blocked then returned is ridiculously low.  if going to kneel just run backward for 2 sec
ProfessorShine,cant tell u how many times cabs from airport would try to take u absolute longest way on purpose.  then argue.
ProfessorShine,fun fact: he almost got penn st hc job before they hired bill obrien.   not everyone should be a head coach.
ProfessorShine,he wanted temple to drop to d2 and i vehemently disagreed but most of his other stuff were great to read
ProfessorShine,but sports books and sports book marketing people told me sports betting is the same as the investment industry. so confusing
suuma810,no common games tiebreaker comes before conf record. and there the eagles would have the edge with a win over nyj.
suuma810,that is  my assumption too. i guess it wasn't good for rivera when he mocked analytics a couple weeks ago lol-
suuma810,we  daily fantasy sports  really disagree - my point is that goff is much more valuable to the rams than gurley.
suuma810,the #bills had scoring drives of more than 50 yards in two of their five games this season vs. lac  min.
suuma810,i think i would rather watch hunter rushing against trent brown for an hour than flacco vs allen in week one!
suuma810,the #eagles need jason peters 100 percent  in week one. vaitai didn't show any progression he was awful during the preseason.
ClevTA,where did u see that? i know he passed on jets last  year bc he wanted to hire his own staff
ClevTA,love jimmy. really do. but hes horrendous at nfl betting and his game of the year is ravens -3.5. theres that
ClevTA,his head was touched before he hit the ground and way before his hand went oob. glad it didnt cost me
ClevTA,right bc kuzma is such a value add player. im sure his 8-25 from the field will be the big difference
ClevTA,in the last 10 years ne is 22-1 at home in october and have won half of them by double digits
ClevTA,but honestly u think an nfl team up 2 at half wants to quit? one of the oddest things ive heard
ClevTA,nobody says he has to be good. just not completely atrocious. im a bit nervous with him against seattles run gm
ClevTA,getting the jags in a tease that gets u over +7 is probably smart. hard to see a blowout either way
ClevTA,hes not being serious. the guy loves vertical shots. sets up play action deep shot to obj off the bat. brilliant

CizzlingSports,20+ plays/day season and ok yeah we're really gonna understand why  and  would apparently rather drink bleach than provide bankroll recommendations
CizzlingSports,"you're down -15.7 units in  college football  so no not the same at all actually

# worst of all time   

cc:"
CizzlingSports,"he has more than one. i understand his ""man book"" was the first one. excerpts can be found in this thread:"
CizzlingSports,you can see the running total of units won/lost here since the start of the 17-week program. -12.19u was on 9/20/19
CizzlingSports,"what happened to    and  (who seemed happier than a pig in slop that he signed a ""long-term"" contract with  last july)?"
CizzlingSports,hmm pokerstars full tilt and absolute poker were not named as defendants in their counterpart criminal action riddle me that gouks
CizzlingSports,-19.83 units over 2671 plays that anyone paid attention too since jambos starting selling picks on 8/27/19; nothing before that matters
CizzlingSports,fun is when  started hiding long-term records behind a pay wall at the start of the 2019-20 nfl season because well....
CizzlingSports,breaking news:  vs.  is def a fight we need but randy calling mraco an obese is really throwing some stones here
spanky,"to all betting partners. 
we shut down for next two days...we will be ready to attack first thing thursday morning. thanks!"
spanky,i speak my opinion.  sign up bonuses are cool. freeplays are cool. selectively refunding losing bets is a recipe for disaster.
spanky,once a game starts then i agree bets should stand.  this is clearly taking a shot at the customer. typical  bullshit.
spanky,ill be back again soon. hoping  or  could put me up so i can lose some more money in the sportsbook
spanky,back home to jersey tomorrow. you dont know how good you got it till youve lived without it for so long.
spanky,agreed. trust is everything in this business. references and reputation is what we base our decisions on who to partner with.
spanky,chris andrews is a gentleman bookmaker. he brings honor and prestige to the profession. pleasure being his customer and his friend.
spanky,thats a short term anomaly that cant last long term. guy will either stop turn it around or go broke trying.
spanky,the leagues can go f themselves.  being a nj resident my tax money was wasted on their legal battles for years.
spanky,appreciate the kind words dinky but mt rushmore is for legends like you that paved the way for guys like me.
spanky,whats really annoying is your garbage knock off version asi software. youll never come close to dgs quality.  know your roll.
spanky,my guess is if  shed light on all the shops that kicked me out they would be angering the wrong people
spanky,i could have personally cut that by about 20 percent  if  let me take a stab at that +3....  oh well
spanky,i've been banned from practically every sportsbook in new jersey - most i have video evidence.... check out my media etc...
spanky,i please guilty to booking bets that i placed back in 2012!  i know it sounds crazy but thats a fact
spanky,best jobber in history. i love how the imprint of the hand was on his ring jacket later in his career.
spanky,shout out to my man  . one of the hardest working and nicest guys in the bizness. always a pleasure pal
spanky,this is exactly how it was when i first started betting sports almost 20 years ago.  god i miss those days!
spanky,donbest being down is equivalent to me being in a shopping mall alone with a free sign up everywhere... its magical
DocBettor,bitcoin down 50 percent  unless you were sharp and deposited all of it into  and made 5 percent  cc  #gamblingtwitter #btc
DocBettor,at the end of the 17 weeks if they finish negative can you please share your experience collecting on the guarantee?
PlusEVAnalytics,there is no bigger waste of your time/energy as a tweeter than putting out a take with the intention of hedging
PlusEVAnalytics,in terms of in-depth conversations about the nfl between an australian and a german this is among the best ive heard.
PlusEVAnalytics,our roi is more meant as a measure of skill than as a measure of financial results. thats the big difference.
PlusEVAnalytics,so your analysts arent stealing the picks and betting them for themselves on the sly? hmmm i wonder why that is
PlusEVAnalytics,of course - otherwise how would the closing line value futures im going to sell you have a settlement value? :)
PlusEVAnalytics,ok why do people at a roulette table gamble? because they think they have some kind of skill to predict numbers?
PlusEVAnalytics,i got a 419 (nigerian prince) scam letter via snail mail today! this retro craze has officially gone way too far!!!
PlusEVAnalytics,lets define as something thats not priced into the futures markets. nebulous definition i know but thats how life is sometimes...
PlusEVAnalytics,go back 5 years in a time machine and tell someone clayton keyshaw is pitching today and the total is 12.5
PlusEVAnalytics,does anyone have experience solving f(x)=0 where f is a complex function that has to be evaluated using monte carlo simulation?
PlusEVAnalytics,ive never researched this but is the motivation factor so strong that the inferior team on the road should be -4.5?
aluckyaday,you too! mine will probably depend on how yan bingtao gets on in the uk championship snooker. have him at 125/1!
aluckyaday,what happens if you  daily fantasy sports  remove the margin. is the combination of 2 biases enough to overcome the margin?
aluckyaday,how do they calculate the insurebet price? are they just using standard each way terms or do they remove the filth?
aluckyaday,isn't this an issue with elo. in the early stages of a career it is more dependent on opportunity than ability?
aluckyaday,what you need is a similar diagram for recreational punters. i'm guessing mathews point is he has seen such a thing?
aluckyaday,actually soft books are quite important as they are how pinnacle gets access to the recreational money that feeds everyone else.
theFirmAISports,haha in the business world this happens all the time too... pay top talent to provide analysis and then its ignored...
theFirmAISports,so if the bills and jets are as good as people think then the giants will be at around 6ish wins
joeytunes2,"ok well i'm not gonna post everywhere in nj. soooooo i'm focusing on the bigger books.

joeytunes2,be more thrn happy to show u my accts if you want .  let us  see who u played. you cunt
joeytunes2,westbrook's is the funniest. looks like the biggest bitch who cant throw a punch. but tries so hard to be hard.
joeytunes2,ty my guyyyy. appreciate the love. never ask for shit either.  i ask for the opportunity to earn for mi amigos!
joeyisaks,couch  with no chiefs or niners fans anywhere nearby  and no random people shouting every play for their bet. no thanks
joeyisaks,take the bottom teams out - they are clearly tanking and its not thattttt bad everyone a world behind mystics though
joeyisaks,this deal is actually so gamblers get the lineups last. sportsbooks will get the info before gamblers to prevent inside info
EdMillerPoker,well duh tho i dont think theres anyone betting seriously who needs that explained to them... a weird rant this one
EdMillerPoker,(of course what they do then is revert to using results and therefore throw many babies out with the bath water.)
EdMillerPoker,this is the best argument for not betting both sides actually bc u will get that bad bet every damn time
EdMillerPoker,i dont think so i think theyll be comfortably positive after 17 weeks. season 2 is where things start getting weird.
EdMillerPoker,caucus is quite the euphemism. they should call it spend half a day at an elementary school sitting in tiny chairs
EdMillerPoker,you can either bluff once on the flop or check-fold depending on how many preflop calls and how table plays postflop
EdMillerPoker,if you make ppl login to unsub your email list you are a bad person and you should be feel bad
EdMillerPoker,not sure how near. for sure we want to do it. not at top of the work queue at the moment.
EdMillerPoker,if ppl like this book enough we might write another and i imagine some of that stuff would go in it
EdMillerPoker,think alun is mostly right. large number of americans know almost zilch about europe and also have no problem with that.
EdMillerPoker,no. the idea is that its a more advanced concept than the bare minimum that you need to win a 1-2.
EdMillerPoker,seems obv to me both are real and also that most ppls attempts to measure and predict them are total garbage
EdMillerPoker,his schtick is to be loud and dumb about everything right? shame that seems to be such a profitable media niche.
GolcondaFund,not high on texans o-line but watson looks composed eyes down field feels pocket well runs and is fearless. bright future.
GolcondaFund,great line -160 live michigan after tipped defensive  touchdown  gators. getting bought up -185. so far o-line/d-line mich outplaying gators #trade
nonrandomalpha,unc has played uva and duke to the final shot (and should have won both). unc doesnt get near enough credit.
nonrandomalpha,this is actually false. using the same analogy finding suitable or superior alternatives has forced the price of oil secularly lower.
nonrandomalpha,the trading desk podcast is live! hear our preliminary thoughts into how we may construct the  nfl sportfolios for week 15
nonrandomalpha,a meaningful added weapon for a team on the rise and accumulating confidence with their mono-free qb back at the helm...
nonrandomalpha,do you hear yourself/can you read? lol how many times have the skins lost by 40 this season...at home? ill wait...
nonrandomalpha,ole miss was projected to be the worst team in the sec so not surprising. memphis doesnt look impressive either tho.
nonrandomalpha,indeed and the nfl openly admitted the bucs undue scheduling burden was actually an oversight they wish they could take back.
LeeSharpeNFL,read this   daily fantasy sports  make a terrible mistake and turn mitch trubisky into a long term signing we'll immediately regret.
LeeSharpeNFL,something tells me your love of ties is entirely dependant on the tiebreaker rules impact on them in the current scenario.
LeeSharpeNFL,expected points added is a bogus stat because  it is  for teams.  that is  why i stick with  touchdown :int ratio.
whale_capper,new deep dive is live... enjoy our recap of week 16 and the assessment of early market numbers for week 17
whale_capper,through the f15 games luka is the clear mvp and hes 20... only giannis has higher trade value at this moment
whale_capper,daily fantasy sports  feel like i can enjoy game 7 without knowing who mattress mack bet on... anyone? does anyone know?
whale_capper,deep dive into the nfl week 3 slate breaking down every angle on the board with  one of our best enjoy!
whale_capper,very fair point nothing like seeing social media posts of jags partying in london 8  hours before they play the eagles
whale_capper,marathonbet consistently the first euro book to open tennis and  it is  one of the weirdest books i've ever come across
whale_capper,there is plenty i wish we did differently but mostly just interested in re-igniting the conversation... any and all feedback welcome
whale_capper,fair point im cool on the #4 pick and high on how important playoff experience is and thats coloring my perception
whale_capper,can't even say how many minutes he'll get but a during the reg season he slowed down their pace a lot
AndyMSFW,"recapping-
: 1-2
: 4-1 (plus hou from yesterday!)
tomorrow-
: georgia state +8
: green bay +4 (nice number andy)"
AndyMSFW,i can't recall who screenshotted this to give them credit.   it is  not the headshot i send for modeling gigs though.
AndyMSFW,like trying to buy a 2019 ford fiesta with a plinko chip because i saw it on the price is right.
AndyMSFW,let us  all take a moment to be surprised that the guy from this photo was short with a reporter today.
AndyMSFW,yeah i played them smaller essentially spending all my futures winnings if they all lost.  was nice to come out ahead.
AndyMSFW,"maybe the ""girl takes shirt off"" prop is more wishful thinking but  it is  a double win if it cashes. #womeninfootball"
JoeyKnish22,yeah those poor people sitting on kent +10 or +9 or +8.5/+8/+7.5/+7 must be crushed with this news. very sad. #maxwisdom
JoeyKnish22,those 2* kids and preferred walk-ons are gonna be sooo hype before they eventually decide to go to alcorn state instead.
JoeyKnish22,the crew at  saying fuck cris and posting their own set of numbers after market was up is big dick energy.
JoeyKnish22,huh. i typically like fading the ivy league in non-con or fading ivy league bettors cause theyre so overrated. gl tho.
JoeyKnish22,you might end up jobless spending years training a japanese guy on how to play baccarat and never seeing a dime.
JoeyKnish22,when i was there i asked to see the risk room and got escorted out by security with no drink tickets.
JoeyKnish22,i love food network and the cooking channel around thanksgiving. content is just absolutely phenomenal. late night food porn for hours.
JoeyKnish22,dealing -140 each side? son you need to leave circa and come work for knishypph i like how you do business.
JoeyKnish22,lol. well not sure who had it but that is a great speech. very motivational hope you took it to heart.
JoeyKnish22,"*pretends to be shocked*

he didnt wanna play another season for a liquored up holgo thats alienated half the team? huh."
JoeyKnish22,hi junkyard! heard you on the radio other day. have some browns futures at  will you guys be refunding those? thanks!
JoeyKnish22,its pretty shocking it hasnt gone up in flames but theyre alright. has been relatively good developing the younger players too.
JoeyKnish22,lol yup id say last years colts sauce was mostly (maybe completely) financially driven. pour one out for 25/1 division futures.
JoeyKnish22,just wait until you hear who he likes in the big ten better get some ramen from costco for the fall.
TheKostos,fun show today lots of good stuff on totals this weekend in conjunction with the fantasy semifinals. thanks   for having me
TheKostos,the best moment of 2020 for me will be when the seahawks lose in the playoffs. nothing else will come close
TheKostos,to slapdick steve hauschka and brett maher my venmo is open guys. feel free to refund me for my over bet
TheKostos,there have to be better kickers than these clowns that miss xps and short  field goal s on a weekly basis.
TheKostos,was actually thinking it'd benefit psg lol because the fans won't be there to audibly gasp as they choke it away
TheKostos,how great would it be if the rock got the dem nomination and wasn't the wwe hofer in the final two
TheKostos,my excitement level is ridiculously high for real/city. can we please fast-forward these next 15 minutes and get to 3pm et???
TheKostos,imagine not being able to watch a leo messi champion's league game on television in the year of our lord 2020
TheKostos,capped tonight's nba card and i've currently got five sides i like. can't wait to go through it from 6-7pm et
TheKostos,since you're a good looking dude  it is  a strong decision. if you were an ugly looking mfer it'd be bad
TheKostos,also going to take me time to get used to  going with his real name and pic of himself for avatar
TheKostos,imagine being a dipshit moron that thought the halftime show was too sexual. lol. what a bunch of clown ass prudes
TheKostos,"holy shit what an end to that eli press conference. ""only a giant."" legend. my all-time favorite athlete. next stop canton."
TheKostos,didnt want jason garrett as head coach. fine with him as oc. apparently this is very difficult for people to comprehend
TheKostos,hope is a team that wants either tua or herbert trades up. i think you're probably right. but tua declaring helps.
LockyLockerson,"first 3 quarters: why didn't i bet the suns even without the edge i needed?

4th quarter: oh.   that is  why."
LockyLockerson,to be fair we had a phenomenal end-game go our way with charlotte last night so i can't be that upset
LockyLockerson,when was the last time a player won the heisman in a year where they missed a regular season game entirely?
LockyLockerson,those same people max bomb-ed north texas when d'eriq king was redshirted and need to get all their money back somehow.
LockyLockerson,it is  at least a more fun game on paper (in terms of implications) than we had all of last weekend
LockyLockerson,if the blazers win outright after the way today has gone i'm declaring myself clairvoyant for the rest of the weekend.
LockyLockerson,that might have been the most i've cheered for the cavs since lebron left.  what a great team.  they're going places.

DannyParkins,there's zero chance the bears get trevor lawrence next year. everyone is gonna be tanking for him and they're too good.
DannyParkins,of course but who is suggesting there's never a time to shoot the mid range? this isn't a conversation involving absolutes.
DannyParkins,the joker was an intense movie-going experience. the tension in the theater was palpable and joaquin phoenix gave an incredible performance.

DannyParkins,carton might be going to prison but hes a helluva radio talent. this from the penn state tragedy is an all-timer.
DannyParkins,i am blown away by how many people on our text-line are claiming the yankees colors are also black and white.

Ccon8181,they lose today and dont need to worry about the 12th man. be playing away. but might be best playing eagles.
Ccon8181,i like the titans in this one at 2.5 or better.. henry is out so you can wait might get 3.
Ccon8181,yea they were calling ticky tack all game... in penn states favor but then miss the blatant one at the end.
Ccon8181,true. but they spent all that money up front on the defense line and dont dominate very poor against the run.
Ccon8181,playoff #harden is like a guy forced to work overtime. puts in minimum effort until hes finally sent home. #rockets #warriors
Ccon8181,yea they did. your boys hate putting teams away. good thing pitt is so bad they couldnt get the shot off.
Ccon8181,looking at the 2nd half line #wizards -5.5 is correct side imo but i'm going to let hawks  field goal  ride.
Ccon8181,i'm more pissed at myself for backing them. they continue to be the worst coached and lackluster energy team in d1
Ccon8181,#clemson registered as a pkay up to -10.. won't back them! right side but just like maryland statistical anomaly.  gotta pass
Ccon8181,i love the #bucs today but the group i consult for is on #broncos heavy so best to pass for me.
Ccon8181,that is  just not right... rosen smiling and laughing after the game. they didn't put them away when they should have

kellyinvegas,in vegas tonight? come down to  and hang with   and i. football. drinks. food. cash. doesnt get much better than that.
kellyinvegas,seems too easy. im not rushing to back the lions but no chance im laying points with jameis on the road.
kellyinvegas,wearing a  sweater to the  game. couldnt decide who to root for. but that +185 got me to take the bait.
kellyinvegas,correct. but i cant control the plays the call the flags they throw (or dont). i cant control qbs kickers etc.
kellyinvegas,this weeks show... we touch on a lot. but  helping me get through the first 4 minutes is absolutely the best!
kellyinvegas,never flown to asia. only trip to europe was private. so guessing no matter what im not going to be pleased

TheCousinSal,after watching the chiefs and this vikings defense play today im  starting to think matt moore is a top 5 qb.

TheCousinSal,i wouldve been apoplectic had he signed with the red sox or yankees. on the other hand this seems so unsatisfying.
TheCousinSal,bad call to kick here vance joseph.  you have to at least line up to try to draw the browns offsides.
TheCousinSal,if youre in a giving mood the  is a worthwhile charity. also give the 4 points in tonights nuggets/lakers game. #givingtuesday2018

12Xpert,ranked like this liverpool are away and clear manchester city are third bottom and arsenal are basically just crap all round.
12Xpert,if the market was fully efficient the blue line slope would be 1 and the orange line slope would be 0.
12Xpert,it is  just easier. path of least resistance. especially in highly regulated markets with taxes to pay and rules to follow.
12Xpert,"but you thought wrong because you say ""they are all (i think) right wing."" you're just confirming your own confirmation bias."
12Xpert,the actual electorate on 12th december should be big enough which is when the wavefunction collapses and one reality is observed.
12Xpert,narrative fallacy law of small numbers outcome bias all rolled into one. people love stories especially if they are fairy tales.
12Xpert,yeah that is quite interesting. although i know not to be fooled by variance even over samples as big as 10000.
12Xpert,if you could give me a more detailed example of what you are suggesting then perhaps i can understand it better.
12Xpert,i see. so it would be understandable if their model got beat since others have more opportunity to access more information.
JambosPicks,"a pretty ugly football game to open the #nfl season and a very ugly night for our #bears -3 play.

JambosPicks,they were huge road underdogs but the #tigers have shut out the #rays 2-0 and provided jambos subscribers a big-time winner!

mschwimer,we dont offer any parlays. only straight bets. all 1 unit. no one has ever had an issue with this before.
mschwimer,a lot of things. again. that is part of our ip and a reason i think we have been so successful.
mschwimer,every single pick is 1 unit.  we post plays from 11amet - 10pmet in order to accommodate subscribers from each coast.
mschwimer,if thats what you really believe then get the money while its hot!  take the 10k!  any reason why you wouldnt?
mschwimer,this is how vegas does it. not nj. look on my feed. a follower posted the rule directly from the site.
mschwimer,"i wish the tv would automatically mute itself or change the channel whenever these directv string people commercials come on.
#absoluteworst"
mschwimer,my team has the 2nd highest points in teh league... neals team has 40 points less than mine after two weeks.
mschwimer,understood.  best fantasy book series ever written in my opinion.  i'm gonna need mr martin get 6 done sometime next year
mschwimer,that is the worst tweet iv seen... im upset i even clicked on that link... i should unfollow u for that
mschwimer,not unhappy with this virginia start... defense looks good... need to create some big plays on offense... big second half #hooooooooooooooos
RufusPeabody,it is  a matter of time. and patience. neither of which i seem to have a lot of these days.
RufusPeabody,but i have 5 years of data. granted the composition of the committee changed a bit from year to year
RufusPeabody,definitely. beating oregon is not as impressive of a win as if they had come in undefeated in pac-12 play.
RufusPeabody,of course! to properly quantify it you need to know how much a move from -3 to -3.5 is worth.
RufusPeabody,id be a much better bettor if i bet more on my winning bets and less on my losing bets.
RufusPeabody,no because betting with a random stranger on the internet is not +ev. i have no idea if youll pay.
RufusPeabody,have you been living under a rock? i waited till after all the major media outlets had broken the story.
RufusPeabody,traveling east to west and  it is  not a super long flight. honestly dallas to ny isn't that much longer.
jeffma,hey just saw you present at phocuswright. would love to connect while here. follow me and i can dm you
jeffma,so can we agree the dolphins peaked somewhere between 15-35 percent  to win the afc east? does that equal might?
jeffma,ill give lebron credit but he was not the reason the celtics shot 7-39 on pretty much wide open 3s
jeffma,may i take this opportunity to remind you how dumb it is that we only have a 4 team playoff?
jeffma,thanks bear and apologize for the senseless trolling. was just trying to engage you in a discussion on the point
jeffma,red sox are doing their best to remind us of what  it is  like to be a red sox fan
jeffma,we live in a world where our president is publicly concerned about being made fun of on saturday night live
jeffma,got it. so you think the oddsmakers who made the futures market believe warriors true odds are 49 percent  cc/
jeffma,it is  a pragmatic view. where do they lose advantage long term? either i am missing something or you are
SportsCheetah,there was a shop offering the blazers +1700 here in-game. down 11 going into the 4q but come on now.
SportsCheetah,huh? and bama in over both! lsu beat 4 better teams. that was the point. its about rsum they say.
SportsCheetah,may pull this out anyway but almost choked it away shooting 52 percent  from 3 to utahs 17 percent .
SportsCheetah,wrong +$ now across the board after dame missed the bunny and gs went the other way for a bucket.
SportsCheetah,i gave chase young one tweet as many as i gave an in-game nuggets-pelicans bet last night. youll be okay.
SportsCheetah,rough tyrell sequence on two different passes that put oak in minimum chip shot range. he dropped both of these.
capjack2000,sorry to see this. familiarize yourself with twitters block function - as that is how journalism is done at lsr.
capjack2000,"hey  remember when draftkings testified that a single operator monopoly would be bad for legal sportsbetting in a jurisdiction?

 does."
capjack2000,"seriously don best?  

is 15 minutes before tip-off really the best time to see how injury alerts work? 

ps: #getwellsoontomsun"
capjack2000,dude you're on the ac expressway. i'd consider it more of a sign if you didn't see a rutgers logo.
capjack2000,im sure everyone at betamerica has become a huge 49ers fan. probably very little exposure on them in that promotion.
capjack2000,in vegas they  daily fantasy sports  use these lines. their user interface in the desert is far better as well.
capjack2000,how does a small bank with one branch get a lucrative contract for a state-run sportsbetting operator...in a different state?
capjack2000,"sounds like a display error at the book. according to donbest william hill iowa is dealing:
o23 -115
u23 -105"
capjack2000,"hence the quotes around ""exchange architecture."" 

 it is  still big imo. might be bigger for those in europe than us."
capjack2000,congratulations. i'd much rather see a two-sided prop market but you were probably forced to set it up this way.
capjack2000,i like it. who will take the first snap for the colts in week 1? seems like a good #nameabet
capjack2000,"and then what about indiana? where it seems penn has sold the ""2nd skin"" to both thescore and pointsbet concurrently."
capjack2000,i've got an audi and bmw both manual...the upside is my two teenage kids never ask to borrow my cars.
dinkinc,doing the best thing for the horse.  to many people with different views. at least maryland took some steps ..
dinkinc,he won't.... too embarrassing when he can't get close to the catcher and you know he won't work to improve
dinkinc,which of the four starting pitchers today will falter ??? who will shine ?? such a cool day for baseball
dinkinc,you would have hated the boston tea party .. i would have gone 1-4 in soccer if that didnt happen
dinkinc,that was fascinating and extremely sad to learn..... i am sure it is accurate as it was so well presented...
dinkinc,yesterday 2-0 mlb    lost caps series in overtime ...... baseball making a turnaround... perhaps...  4 in a row at pompano.....
robpizzola,youd think that after this many missed field goals you would just stop kicking field goals. the clapper strikes again.
robpizzola,everett running open down the sidelines with no one within ten yards and goff missed him by a nautical mile.
robpizzola,so will everyone else in your pool i hope youre happy splitting with everyone at the end of the year.
robpizzola,i've seen most of his accounts and he's actually a $50 wnba capper if you want to get it right.
robpizzola,im glad you got something for it but dont make a habit of cashing out. youre killing your expected value.
robpizzola,it really is especially when considering how teams that are down 0-3 in a series consistently underperform vs. market expectations.
robpizzola,tv broadcast is saying that dybala is out injured. looked like he hurt his foot late in the first half.
robpizzola,i think i like all three but pls god dont let this be what pushes you to place a bet.
robpizzola,i honestly  daily fantasy sports  know how  that is  possible. i just had the best nfl season of my life.
RASPicks,so  evaluated everything you were doing and agreed this was the best path to take with your information? truly epic.

RASPicks,will be up on the website in a month or so.  feel free to e-mail any questions in the meantime.
RASPicks,without question this is the best resource for college football injury information on the web and it is free:  .co/hh4uita9

ProfessorShine,there was a time nj didnt even give casino table players bottled beer.  not surprised by them being cheap half-asses
ProfessorShine,my podcast with whale and andy was pretty popular.  ill go on again soon.  fufus and  need more good guests
ProfessorShine,id hope on this stage coaches making 9mil annually wouldnt be treated differently.  this isnt a non-league game vs stetson
ProfessorShine,not one serious bettor pays attention to kellyinvegas. its like having a cooking show  having ronald mcdonald as a guest
ProfessorShine,cant have 900 followers and tweet at others for being dime a dozen.  thats only reason i pointed it out.

suuma810,"week 11 recap:

4-4 -0.51u

started poorly finished strong but ate some juice. on to week twelve!"
suuma810,kenny stills once said that he has a special relationship to adam gase. wouldnt be surprised if jets call first.
suuma810,my tweet referred to cj mosley. but yeah rumors are that barr is going more edge-heavy. maybe a hybrid role.
suuma810,havent seen such a poor red zone performance by the pats in a long time. they didnt deserve to cover.
suuma810,because he looks extremely good for a backup qb but will go back to the bench when jimmy is back.
ClevTA,im prob light on that but sea was missing half their d in that gm. maybe its closer to 7.5-8
ClevTA,this was such a dumb mock. ol te and lb are such bigger needs than b2b wrs in round 1.
ClevTA,strength of schedule prior to penn st. any win at michigan i think is considered worthy to stay at 1
ClevTA,guys i found the one person in the world other than garrett who thinks kicking the  field goal  was smart
ClevTA,how many times do defenders have to think a shovel pass is a fumble before they figure it out ?
ClevTA,hilarious. how the browns arent at least 4 point favorites at this point is beyond me. allen has no chance
ClevTA,im the one who posted poor goff road splits 2 weeks ago. im just talking general perception on the team
ClevTA,i said a top option not the top option. also looking ahead is almost as important than the current week
CizzlingSports,card counting is remarkably easy. not getting flat-bet 86'd and trespassed from every place with a decent game is not.
CizzlingSports,"current fees (pending 10/14/19 results):

two 4-week packages: $1562.00

one 17-week package: $3000.00

 it is  fine."
CizzlingSports,"wrong.

all plays for 9/21/19 were released at 11:03 am.

and jambos directs its subscribers to bet them all immediately."
CizzlingSports,"just when u thought it was over  hits u w/another one

this guy as your client-facer is not helping    cc:"
CizzlingSports,it means they purposely elected not to release any more picks to lock in a  +9.99u w/l on the package
CizzlingSports,.(11/x)on 12/30/19 the last day of 17wk01   were sitting at +10.74u. anything  +10.00 would have required refunds of some sort
spanky,"good for you man. 
you sound very happy. 

ill no longer consider your application to model for me. 

good luck!"
spanky,of course the better question then becomes how many subscribers have that kinda money set aside as a gambling bankroll?
spanky,50 3k subscribers. he said he has a lot more of the lower packages that do not offer the guarantee.
spanky,good to hear.  i have no experience in public speaking. im glad i was able to pass on some knowledge
spanky,in nyc it can be a fully secure bond no 10 percent  option. i have first experience of that rule.
spanky,i do my best to exalt the bookmakers and expose the dressmakers all from personal experience. i wont be bought.
spanky,great questions but the one thing im sure of is the investigation took place after he was up 90k lol
spanky,can't argue with you there... you should see the guys in my office.  they come into work in pajamas sometimes....
spanky,i hear ya joe.  this time of year i focus more going over 142 on a total that closes 148
spanky,believe it or not is was bobbys burger palace black and blue burger. im guessing the blue cheese was funky
DocBettor,just did my best  impression and played back live over 251.5 -110 at the 5:24 timeout in the 4th quarter
DocBettor,reduced is capped at 2k for me but they let you bet more if they reset or change the line
DocBettor,good start to 2020 / this live betting thing from these sports books are from the devil confirmed #risephx  #phxvslal
DocBettor,thanks honestly i have a pretty rudimentary model that takes into the usual stuff like players team ratings pace etc.

PlusEVAnalytics,this inside/outside thing and will there be a back door cover yes/no are two gold prop bets    free of charge
PlusEVAnalytics,unfollowing  until jan 1 had to be done. its like a machine gun of rapid fire uninteresting content right now.
PlusEVAnalytics,crossed a line man. youre not blocked and youre not muted. youre ghosted. dead to me. have a nice life.
PlusEVAnalytics,cris is currently dealing a flat 3 so thats a one way ticket to hell for everyone involved in this
PlusEVAnalytics,fully expecting jambos to post like +5 units and then we get to fight about closing line value all day
PlusEVAnalytics,remember that scam they pulled at the end of office space? thats breakage and youre the victim! happy breeders cup!
PlusEVAnalytics,anythings possible but id say its unlikely. and if he does this is a pretty bad way to monetize it.
PlusEVAnalytics,i think he is sincere. hell burn a lot of peoples money (mostly his investors) but it wont be intentional.

PlusEVAnalytics,pffffft. the best case ceiling on people watching a major who have money on it is what 3 percent ?
PlusEVAnalytics,at least when obama criticized the derby stewards for political correctness (?) he spelled kentucky right on the first try.
PlusEVAnalytics,heres a fun one to think about - what if 2010s capitalism earns the same retroactive outrage is 1930s racism?
PlusEVAnalytics,anyone disappointed that  is not posting winning 1p picks today its all good - im still posting my losing ones!
aluckyaday,took me a long time to accept i++  never mind all this new fangled stuff. bring back pascal i say!
aluckyaday,pinney take positions in just about every market they take bets on. their traders have confirmed this in twitter discussions.
aluckyaday,true. but the same applies to not removing it. guess its because  i'd rather compare to a 100 percent  line.
aluckyaday,all i know is we need to stop eating cheese to save all those poor people dying from bedsheet tangalation.
aluckyaday,they get pretty protective when it comes to spam. if their ip addresses get on blacklists it causes them problems.
aluckyaday,nope tour de france. although esports is probably going to give it a run for its money in the future!

joeytunes2,does anyone have ace23 if so nyg +7.5 is a ridiculous price. get me some if you do. max plz
joeytunes2,and  are truly good humans. i'm in.. i'll bet raiders plus 7.5 for him. and if loses i'll still donate.

tough problem. easy solution."
EdMillerPoker,really appreciate what vsin is doing to deliver the las vegas experience and perspective to a national audience every day.
EdMillerPoker,my vote is to ditch all the apostrophes in all the possessives but pretty sure im on an island there.
EdMillerPoker,every single time someone sent me this phrase in an email what was said on the phone was badly misrepresented
EdMillerPoker,wow right out the gate two amazing questions with complex and interesting answers and relevance to both bettors and operators.
EdMillerPoker,i accidentally followed someone with the word polymath in their bio. oops that ones a 100 percent  tell i think.
EdMillerPoker,def def. gonna go add every pimpley washington and lee polisci major i can find to my list called gemzzz
EdMillerPoker,if you're in las vegas for wsop imo go hang out with the sheep for a while they're always there
EdMillerPoker,i think business models in nj are still too much in flux these companies are still building out basic infrastructure
EdMillerPoker,feels like pitchers are gonna get better faster than hitters do for a few years. maybe insane k rates coming.
EdMillerPoker,winning (e.g. arbing/steam chasing) is essentially trivial. winning in ways that books will tolerate for substantial action is much harder.
EdMillerPoker,normally i would assume in such a circumstance that it absolutely is not. here im only like 75 percent  sure.
EdMillerPoker,was wondering why my sandwiches lately have been derivative insipid and cliched. thanks no thanks for the brain drain bro.

nonrandomalpha,how did it even start near 50 percent ? eagles should have opened around 85-90 percent  right off the bat.
LeeSharpeNFL,the saints can do the voiding yes. but as you say they have to have the incentive to do so.
LeeSharpeNFL,"maybe if you have a top 5 qb you should not be ""a team that wants to run the football""."
LeeSharpeNFL,wow  is gonna not punish rodgers for that fumble in dakota can't believe he's so biased in favor of rodgers.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""i think we should improve society somewhat.""

""and yet you continue to exist in society as it is now. hmmmm."""
LeeSharpeNFL,jags should miss the extra point on purpose so the raiders play conservatively and try for the  field goal .
LeeSharpeNFL,other people using ron's stuff that he provides openly and for free does not create an obligation of his time.
LeeSharpeNFL,... so the packers are 6-3 in the other games? sounds like they  daily fantasy sports  need him that badly.
LeeSharpeNFL,the best possible outcome now is that cowboys/eagles tie in week 16 and cowboys limp into the playoffs at 6-9-1.

LeeSharpeNFL,"i worry that the answer is the worst possible option: ""yes in the playoffs but not in the regular season."""
LeeSharpeNFL,people love to attach narratives to bad decisions as though  that is  the only team that is making bad decisions.
LeeSharpeNFL,"if we  daily fantasy sports  know when they fall into a ""good rhythm"" how can we attribute anything to that?"
LeeSharpeNFL,what? we have a #2 overall draft pick at qb and the #1 defense last year this seems highly unlikely.

JoeyKnish22,i can see why holgo had king redshirt now he had an elite qb in his son ready to go.
JoeyKnish22,cian fahey had mariota ranked 7th among all qbs and called him an emerging stud in his preseason qb rankings.
JoeyKnish22,havent played one of these in a while but took the longest  touchdown  over 57.5 yards prop (-115) in fsu/clemson

12Xpert,weekend results coming in an hour. 1st/2nd jan fixtures will be added too since i'm away for next 3 days.
12Xpert,try using tonights performance to explain mean regression from the home leg to certain pundits they still wont get it.
12Xpert,"""the polarisation of politics makes fertile ground for an anti-gambling doctrine that appeals to both marxist ideology and right-wing moralism."""
12Xpert,it is  already heavily regulated more than most other countries. would you ban the advertising of gambling in horse racing?
12Xpert,here it is. could you still believe in your system after a 2000-bet long underperformance most of it making losses?
12Xpert,it would also make him britain's first ever grand tour winner ahead of #bradleywiggins. pro cycling you gotta love it.
12Xpert,he does it not to get under the umpires skin but his opponents. frankly i think it verges on cheating.
12Xpert,if you want to argue about something else then do it in another context. and  daily fantasy sports  be insulting.
12Xpert,one early final portuguese playing tonight which is also a woc. remainder of weekend fixtures will follow friday as usual.
12Xpert,again if we try to use 538 predictions as a measure of truth (betting opening pinnacle odds) we get this.

mschwimer,either way. no need to buy anything. registering is free for everyone. you can see everything we do for free.

mschwimer,very interesting. im going to look at the 3-5 most prominent us books and see whats up. will report back.
mschwimer,had under first 5 in rangers game. line was 7. was 1-0 heading into the 5th inning. and wull cya

mschwimer,we pay and find our own housing... im staying in a hotel for the season... not happy about it haha
RufusPeabody,it is  cooper allen robinson lockett boone and sanders for 4 spots (2 wr 2 flex). you'd bench coop?
RufusPeabody,i just want to hear comments from his parents on this relationship. can someone please reach out to them?
RufusPeabody,i wouldn't say that. if i had a time machine i would have looked into it 10 years ago.
RufusPeabody,wont be looking for a bettor per se. care about data science bona fides problem solving skills and creativity.
RufusPeabody,i actually really enjoyed it too! just a lot of time for no discernible reward other than writing practice.
RufusPeabody,if youre not following  youre probably not in the loop on the legal sports betting landscape in the us!
RufusPeabody,length has mattered a lot in past events there...but length matters a lot in every champions tour event ever
RufusPeabody,that is  what i had seen before as well. the faq link on your home page does not work.
RufusPeabody,obviously there will be parlays and futures also but i'm just highlighting how ridiculous at 15 percent  hold is.
RufusPeabody,i know we're all in this together. would've helped if our government wasn't a month late to the party.
RufusPeabody,sometimes you have to realize your opinion isnt the most important in the world. (by you i mean me)
RufusPeabody,had a fantastic experience betting props at  was pleasantly surprised with the limits  more than any shop in vegas.
RufusPeabody,this opens a huge can of worms for them and the timing isn't exactly great with the merger upcoming...
RufusPeabody,i've talked to people who know and i  daily fantasy sports  think  it is  what you think it is.
RufusPeabody,sanders could have caught it but he wouldnt have been able to run after the catch if he did.
jeffma,say 1000 picks id probably tell him to stop giving picks on espn or get out of the business
jeffma,the long awaited definitive interview with 2nd runner up  find out whether he plans to get litigious and shit
jeffma,was pointing out listening to podcast because i literally reference you your work and your tracking of their picks
jeffma,thanks for everything! was great to work with you! i guess this means no one on one tomorrow :)
jeffma,this makes little sense to me. do you think he had a conversation with showalter about what he learned?
jeffma,i'm partial to the great brain series... also enjoy the three investigators. fancy myself a modern day jupiter jones
jeffma,i personally just pick the team that will win and then bet them. 23-0 since i've been doing it
jeffma,sorry. that last request was from my team's twitter account. can you follow me so i can dm you?
jeffma,my favorite line is the one about hogan's heroes... nobody laughs so my guess is it wasn't a joke
jeffma,"i think carroll was also confused about belichick not calling a timeout hence the gnarly ""waste a play comment"""
SportsCheetah,kentucky +250 probably the nuts here after vt had 3 chances to end it after getting gifts and whiffed.

SportsCheetah,you also went from 9-11 to 9-14 somehow anyway even counting the jets game i said i didnt bet
SportsCheetah,tobias harris has missed his last 20 3s over the sixers last 6 games. he makes $32.7m this year.
SportsCheetah,its easier to get rolling against prevent d and o down 21 in 4q. i liked the 2 try.
SportsCheetah,i prefer never to see a montrezl harrell floater from the free throw line straight away bank attempt again.
SportsCheetah,wazzu was 3/8 in the red zone converting their trips to  touchdown s really should have won that one.

capjack2000,i agree. much more content on the screen when you drill into games as well. same bets better layout.
capjack2000,nv properties weren't mentioned in the press release. my guess is the m and tropicana become kambi managed books.

robpizzola,bills should go for two here to know where they stand. they wont though. none of the coaches do.
robpizzola,jake also had a run of 5 games where he gave up 3 goals or less mid-november last year.
robpizzola,yes greiss should get more starts imo but  it is  not like varly is a complete sieve like allen.
robpizzola,they should give jason garrett that stupid galloping gobbler trophy for gobbling up the last decade of my life.

robpizzola,quintana +135 is about a 1.7 percent  edge if you're into betting games where market wholeheartedly disagrees with me.
robpizzola,tb #1 ranked penalty kill strikes with the shorthanded goal. unbelievable how good their special teams was this season.
RASPicks,obviously we accentuate the positives just like you accentuate the negatives. our service record is never hard to find.

RASPicks,what ras expected value looks like for $1000  $2000 bettors after 200 plays when factoring in cost of service.
RASPicks,yeah the fcs football has really padded our record last two years.  not sure where we'd be without it.
RASPicks,even if you are moving for winners doesn't mean same lines and/or success will be realized for your followers.
RASPicks,you should expect win rates to go down as volume goes up if that is what you are asking.

VegasRefund,gesicki was one of my favorites coming into the draft and is still sitting there going into rd 2.
ProfessorShine,its very very inportant to adhere to our values.   also were sorry for those values please dont be mad
ProfessorShine,my money is on my teeth. send me the games and ill gladly send you $ back. cmon fam
ProfessorShine,maybe 2 worst boxing decisions ive ever seen were ramirez-whitaker and chavez-whitaker.  guy was untouchable for a long time.
ProfessorShine,id watch just to see her to insist on buying off dead numbers and  saying ill take those bets
ProfessorShine,"crawford is over a 90 percent  fav to win tonight.  no one should care ""where the money is going""."
ProfessorShine,being allowed to use the media to spread lies about business practices is about as slimy as it gets.
ProfessorShine,small sample trends quantifying focus gut feelings fades cliches ignoring prices....just every awful poor betting strategy you can name.
suuma810,wenn teams einen franchise-qb in ihm sehen werden sie den cards bestimmt auch ein entsprechendes angebot machen oder nicht?
suuma810,the titans will be without dt jurrell casey but the colts will be without c ryan kelly. two blows.
suuma810,sometimes it seemed like merging zims willingness to run into the weekly gameplans resulted into weird situational play calls.
suuma810,and that is extremely bad when you face 3rd  long because you run for 2 yards on 2nd  10.
suuma810,i will probably pass that game and just enjoy watching it. can make arguments for both sides right now.
suuma810,r=0.23; r2=0.053. the slower the pace the more points defenses give up. but  it is  only 5.3 percent  though.

ClevTA,zero effort on that gl d from the browns d. thats what u show to get your hc fired
ClevTA,u want a daguarantee? ill give u one. obj 70+ yards and at least one  touchdown . its a
ClevTA,im starting to get interested at 9.5. that niner d still exists and eventually cards turnover regression is coming
ClevTA,wait was this the browns saying kiss my ass or realizing their first round pk is potentially top 10?
ClevTA,5-7 for 63 yards and one sack fumble on first down drop backs. obv pass situations he looks bad
ClevTA,dont agree with that at all. hes a monster and has already shown it in preseason. 20-8 wins it
ClevTA,wednesday. the contest line is 1.5. thats why i posted that id still take it at -2 -120 yesterday
ClevTA,yikes. i guess higgins but is that all thats left? brown could have upside too but its josh allen

DocBettor,thanks! i use a model so its just based on the outputs. theres a lot of room for improvement
PlusEVAnalytics,thats where bayes comes in. if he didnt have a track record of selfishness nobody would care about this.
PlusEVAnalytics,sum (p_i * log(x + r_i)) = log(x) solve for x as a function of the p_is and r_is
PlusEVAnalytics,what odds can i get on our inflated sense of self-righteous moral superiority to win  person of the year?
PlusEVAnalytics,thanks. i have some crazy ideas about better ways to price tickets but nobody will listen to me :(
PlusEVAnalytics,what kind of stuff is he betting? its almost statistically impossible to be that bad over that sample size...
PlusEVAnalytics,this is one where the mean (what you posted) and the median (what really matters) could be quite different

PlusEVAnalytics,you just said the subs dont care if hes a winning bettor theyre in it for the friendship lol
PlusEVAnalytics,g3 was tor -2.5/221.5 g4 is million -2.5/216. does vegas know something about kawhi status that nobody else knows??
PlusEVAnalytics,brb venmo-ing $1 to every tout out there labeled gambling money for gambling. i do it for the culture.
PlusEVAnalytics,good one thanks id never heard of hierarchical poisson regression but that seems pretty close to what im doing.
aluckyaday,maybe just maybe its because these european books know what they are doing when it comes to recreational bettors.
aluckyaday,what about the west coast would then not still be in bed? or do they not count as americans
aluckyaday,remember you have to factor in the probability of not getting paid if he loses in to that price.
aluckyaday,that is not a good look. would be interesting to see the distribution of starting points for those opinions.
aluckyaday,for all but the very few who have the ability to make it pay with sharp books then yes.
aluckyaday,not in a single document but spread over several with precedents on how those documents are to be interprited
aluckyaday,again you are assuming closing lines are individually efficient which they are not. they are only efficient on average.
aluckyaday,bahrain totally messed that up but i guess that is what happens in national championships unless you are ineos!
aluckyaday,that is why you need to pick a tout with a long term 36 percent  roi at level stakes
aluckyaday,is it really on eurosport or just the player? uk schedule says tennis on 1 and superbikes on 2

joeyisaks,anyone losing 1bv skins at an odd rate this week? lost 6 cause they have a new alert system?
EdMillerPoker,cmon man cut the vegas guys some slack. theyd get steam shoved up their ass all night every night.
EdMillerPoker,the nfl already works the way it should and you shouldnt ever see it flipped like that in nfl.
EdMillerPoker,i watch a lot of history videos and agree theres a lot of very well done content on there
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  its tricky bc i think most of the benefit is in the upside tails
EdMillerPoker,the smaller books trying to run the euro model without the branding will struggle. high expenses. no competitive advantages.

GolcondaFund,i think mitch vs dak is on par. jimmy g. has the upside of the heir apparent to brady.
nonrandomalpha,. its a long offseason hopefully they have a change of heart or at least bring in some competition.
LeeSharpeNFL,bears/packers games are a long source of misery i  daily fantasy sports  know why i do this to myself.
LeeSharpeNFL,this is the nflscrapr model. if you have a suggestion for an alternative model i am open to it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"saints should enforce the personal foul on the try and go for 2.

enforcing on the kickoff is meh."
LeeSharpeNFL,"bears twitter thinks i hate the bears by saying trubisky twitter is bad.

the internet is a rough place."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""you got your football tweets in my politics tweets!"" 

""no you got your politics tweets in my football tweets!"""
LeeSharpeNFL,sounds like a bears representative did go to the nfl workout but did not attend the one actually run.
LeeSharpeNFL,wouldn't be shocked if they were throwaways either. you can verify that by seeing if receiver_player_name is na also.
LeeSharpeNFL,the critique works both ways though: data analysts  daily fantasy sports  know players' mental states. neither do tv pundits.

AndyMSFW,i hate green bay as a team but would take +3.5 at home vs anyone in the nfc playoffs
AndyMSFW,ahhhh... that.  well the timeline was just full of it and i wasn't getting the sports info i wanted.
AndyMSFW,it does seem like a waste to not make some poorly thought out parlays tonight... do the titans play?
AndyMSFW,this is a super underrated aspect of what the proper use of play action can do for your offense.
AndyMSFW,that 4th down play calling decision will be a ton easier for the chargers once melvin gordon is back.
AndyMSFW,been a while since i've been here but they still know how to take care of a guy. #moremoneytobetwith
AndyMSFW,only guest to ever get up and just take a bathroom break in the middle of a podcast recording
AndyMSFW,""" it is  a copycat league"" and these two teams are bound and determined to emulate february's super bowl."

JoeyKnish22,"phil steele on uab eh? 

*sprints to bank to empty whats left in savings account on more southern miss*"
JoeyKnish22,holton ahlers has cost me more money in his career than if i had been a bernie madoff client.
JoeyKnish22,joey potatoes  likes jk dobbins under 149.5 rushing (-110) at  think this nw defense can mash the run game
JoeyKnish22,not sure if theyll change it cause spot reviews are a roulette shit show but murray is obviously short.
JoeyKnish22,definitely helps having a more competent coach. player pool is a bit thin but definitely a better product atm.
JoeyKnish22,all kidding aside. have to feel a bit better about his midyear dip in form yes? bullish for 2019.
TheKostos,also jones could have run that for 20 yards or  it is  a  touchdown  with a better throw. sigh
TheKostos,imagine starting raheem mostert in the fantasy title game and tevin colemans corpse is getting carries inside the 10
TheKostos,two dumb coaches right now in tennessee. one playing for a  field goal  the other allowing a  field goal
TheKostos,finally watched el camino last night. it was good not great but worth checking out if you loved bb.

TheKostos,lol the giants just snapped it with negative time on the play clock and the zebras let it go
TheKostos,dave hate to break it to you but the entire scenario goes kaput when the chargers win on thursday
TheKostos,had dallas and over before the game and doubled down on both 2h.  that is  a good monday night
TheKostos,"denver has the second-biggest sf in the league behind utah

(i'm changing pf to sf for ""slapdick factor"" fyi)"
TheKostos,no better way to get prepped for the tournament (and this weekend's slate) than checking out ken and  tonight
TheKostos,most jealous of you being there when the crowd sings jericho's theme song after the music cuts. so good
TheKostos,never like betting against my own team but hornets -1.5 against the knicks looks like a probable play tonight
TheKostos,guys that wasnt a vick run by mahomes. hes awesome obviously but it was pathetic defense more than anything
TheKostos,after flying back from chicago this morning i will do my best to stay awake for the entire show

LockyLockerson,"if your rationale was ""the coin landed heads"" you'd be already at the level of 99.99999 percent  of us"
LockyLockerson,kinda makes alabama lsu this year a big game for the voters to watch that literally may decide it
LockyLockerson,want to thank ohio state for freeing up the 3rd tv for a different game as soon as possible
LockyLockerson,have watched none of this tournament until now but havent they reviewed a lot of plays like that handball?
LockyLockerson,just when i thought i might have a great championship week tonight happened.  i'm looking at you central michigan.
LockyLockerson,refs in byu are so bad that this game will almost certainly end in the most entertaining way possible
LockyLockerson,imagine being in a game with the best players in the world and your offense is lowry fadeaway jumpers.

DannyParkins,pretty nice effort by contreras framing the final strike of the game cuz that definitely was off the plate.
DannyParkins,every bernie brewer fact you ever wanted to know which is not how i expected the show to start:
DannyParkins,this is well played. i didnt quite consider at the time just how forever meme-able that stunt would become.
DannyParkins,"gronk scored 79  touchdown 's in 115 regular season games which averages to... 

.69  touchdown s per game. 

nice."
DannyParkins,so the padres offer was clearly better. 550 plate appearances when you're 34 years old is no sure thing.

TheCousinSal,i bought the half point to +3.5 and i demand that jabroni dan bailey reimburse me for it. #vikingsvsseahawks
TheCousinSal,the greatest single season slugger in  history  delayed his bar mitzvah to pose with me. what a guy! #kimmelinbrooklyn
TheCousinSal,"step #12...if an old man turns down your shitty whiskey slug him upside the head.

TheCousinSal,archies chair!!! congrats to the cast of all in the family/the jeffersons on a spot on live performance. #liveinfrontofastudioaudience
TheCousinSal,nice to know that no matter how many innings this  game goes it will only count as one loss.
TheCousinSal,the absolute best thing about the texas tech run is knowing how jealous this miserable bastard must be. #ncaatournament
TheCousinSal,"my best bet of the week...

bears -6.5 over eagles 

30-10 final
youre welcome
go pay your christmas bills."
TheCousinSal,i guess we can ditch all that this ravens defense is only good because they havent played anyone chatter.
TheCousinSal,against all odds goes off at 50/1 to win this. theres never been a more important time to vote.
TheCousinSal,harry had him at 28/1.  and we both took blount at 18/1.  i currently have a $30 lead.    #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,hang tight panthers fans.  your team is only 11 field goals shy of losing this game by 3. #carvsno
TheCousinSal,be still my heart attack.  and i enjoying a katzs pastrami sandwich at dekalb market hall in brooklyn. #dmheats
TheCousinSal,sam bradford out now. maybe  daily fantasy sports  bet the house on my first pick. just the tool shed.
TheCousinSal,pretty atrocious 20 minutes.  there's a chance both teams are too embarrassed to return for the second half. #marchmehness
TheCousinSal,if you haven't already i highly recommend attending a spring training game with huey lewis  my friend harry. #mlb
TheCousinSal,i've picked 70 percent  right over the last 2+ years. think about that. here are my week 13 winners
TheCousinSal,9-3 against the spread in october on  here are my week 9 picks + a chance to win $1000.
TheCousinSal,another winning week on  9-3 this month. i'm ditching tootsie rolls + giving out lobster rolls this year. #trickortreat
12Xpert,if they do then that is another story to this one and again one that can be legislated for.
12Xpert,what i am is what dr tamsin edwards ( is. have a read of her thoughtful piece to understand.
12Xpert,that is  reassuring to know. let me know what you think of the pinny article once they publish it.
12Xpert,in low or near zero validity domains like stock picking and sports betting intuition can easily lead you astray.
12Xpert,apparently there's a simple equation  that is  existed for hundreds of years that will save them from the ignominy
12Xpert,just turn the lays into backs. laying 3 is the same as backing 1.50 for it not to happen.
12Xpert,"""1xbet has become one of the most trusted brands over the years."" still stand by that self promotion?  #1xbet"
12Xpert,full credit goes to  for proposing the idea to utilise maximum likelihood estimation to find the optimal betting model.
12Xpert,unfortunately i can't help the code is provided by  so you will need to speak to him about it.
12Xpert,either the bettor has been lucky or the closing lines are not accurate (the odds are still too long).

RufusPeabody,i agree they  daily fantasy sports  have much of a shot. wisconsin and florida are very comparable teams.
RufusPeabody,kinda funny how  thinks 140 plays is a large sample and  thinks 1400 plays is a small sample.
RufusPeabody,closing line value is a proxy for having the right side (at the price you got it at)
RufusPeabody,this is a first for me.  it is  monday and there's not a single nfl side i like.
RufusPeabody,would agree with that? he and i disagree though. im not smart enough to beat the stock market.
RufusPeabody,can someone cc randall busick on this. i dont know his handle. hed be so proud of us.
RufusPeabody,guessing you havent listened to our pod. we havent had any pick-sellers on with the sole exception of

jeffma,think putin is behind it all?  will tell you in his new book #onceuponatimeinrussia get it today: .co/dgt4cjinuc
jeffma,i have a feeling i'm late to this game but reggie miller is literally terrible as a commentator
jeffma,not sure why everyone thinks kentucky is so good. they are 0-2 in this tourney by my count
jeffma,if this flight to phoenix is any indication this is going to be a very pro seahawks crowd
SportsCheetah,i just wanted to make this as morbid a turn as possible now to cool some people down
SportsCheetah,just uga +7.5 we banked on daily wager but left it off article since it went to 7.
SportsCheetah,part of this made me laugh part of me respects the hustle setting cash bonus bars so low.
SportsCheetah,the lakers won without a single player having a positive +/-.  that is  what champions are made of.
SportsCheetah,that has to be one of the most odd foul calls i have ever seen in the nba
SportsCheetah,seeing achilles speculation already so chalk that up to another #cheetahjinx and i apologize to the caldwell-pope family.

capjack2000,looks like they bet the side moneyline and total in the new england patriots game...yep they're in nh.
capjack2000,yep. failed to recognize the mack effect. expect an article next month about how november numbers dropped precipitously.
capjack2000,that seems pretty extreme. care to share what the proposed bet was? have you experienced limits there before?
capjack2000,for those curious heres the fight. schultz got 5 minutes for fighting. rolfe got 5 minutes for receiving.
capjack2000,"daily fantasy sports  forget:
1975.
xanadu las vegas. would have been donald trump's first casino hotel (minority partner)"
capjack2000,actually i'm just spacey enough to prefer a sports book when i want to do some sports betting.
capjack2000,it is  your streams. here in nj 3 of 4 commercials during a sporting event are sportsbook ads.
capjack2000,"crazy day of sports betting action right?

i can't believe  missed out on this. 

seriously. can't believe it."
capjack2000,saw this one at bellagio the other day. the theme is a horny latin guy who chases women...
capjack2000,the allure of contests hasnt quite reached the nj marketing desks yet. theyre still focused on promotional money.
capjack2000,reading between the lines: draftkings didnt have many fsu bettors...and nobody they allowed to bet more than $25.
capjack2000,short answer: no chance. let it be motivation to you to build a better don best for yourself.
dinkinc,man.  all sorts of crap gets thrown your way.  glad you have the determination to overcome it all
dinkinc,i hope someone eith a $42.99 purchase says no .. how dare they say they give anything ?
dinkinc,i am hopeful they will change when  returns.. i still support them and like everyone behind the counter...
dinkinc,how many active customers does bet cris have ??   you  daily fantasy sports  have to be exact here
dinkinc,how awesome will this be......  if i stick my tongue out can i be in the match ??
dinkinc,have fun you too.  racing still has a few great days like this.  enjoy them while you can.
dinkinc,0-2 and another 3 unit loss for the  horses...embarrassing and very sad... no longer time to be funny
dinkinc,kent was in protection mode. may as well take the shortest journey even if the rail is dead
dinkinc,i know of letters to cleo.   aurora boreallis as i recall.  been awhile since their name came up
robpizzola,i cant imagine what could possibly be going through adam gases head to attempt a field goal there?
robpizzola,it is what it is. three red zone picks almost impossible to overcome with a total that high.
robpizzola,i stream most of my games using the american feeds. i find them to be more tolerable usually.
robpizzola,it is  scary to think about how good this patriots team could be if they had a quarterback.
robpizzola,the difference between those examples is that in one of them you still have a chance to win.
robpizzola,i dont know if you are agreeing with me or not but im going to assume you are.
robpizzola,i almost exclusively use uber unless i walk out of my hotel and theres a cab already there
robpizzola,wow rufus is not only a dogs name it is also a hawks name. the more you know!
robpizzola,really wondering if there are still lingering issues with crawfords health. this one is out of left field.
robpizzola,fvv says that dray got a piece of lowrys game-winning shot attempt. i sure as hell hope so.
robpizzola,i wish  was still alive to see his favorite nbaer kyle lowry turn in great performances this series.
robpizzola,"you wouldn't believe how much ""he did exactly what he was supposed to do"" i got last night."
robpizzola,dont know of a sportsbook on the planet that would be offering first three teams to get eliminated.
robpizzola,ferrari has had all the pace all weekend. if they can avoid any bullshit they should be fine.

RASPicks,sorry we haven't released any free picks in a while.  may start it back up at some point.
RASPicks,significant changes to the ras  college basketball  service this year should add even more value than before:  .co/ig2xseetjr
RASPicks,you took to twitter before i ended further discussion because you didn't think i e-mailed you fast enough.
RASPicks,what are you talking about?   no one doing this is waiting for anyone else without a reason to.
RASPicks,starting today will post free  college basketball  plays here on twitter  the .co/lijtncycek forum during month of march.
RASPicks,bookmaker opens week 1 college sides but only taking 2k max.  it had been 5k in previous years.
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  worry there will still be plenty of sharp  college basketball  action for them to tail.
RASPicks,sorry did not see this before.  i would have stayed long on the -2.5 unless you overbet it.

ProfessorShine,id like to know the real story from a reputable news source.  or at least a news source

suuma810,brian schottenheimer loves running on 2nd  10 but they throw a fade on  2nd  goal from the 6
suuma810,yeah i do! each week i post some write-ups and go through the whole card on the podcast.
suuma810,as soon as someone says we want to run the football its always a big red flag. #cardinals
suuma810,incase you missed it : write-up on the #broncos / #ravens game with a pick on the total
suuma810,that is  fair. but it needed just two goal line runs out of 11 and they win 19-18.
ClevTA,browns bring in philip next year to challenge baker. id give up a lot to see that happen
ClevTA,they showed holes v penn st and moved up. theres not much precedent for what u are saying
ClevTA,whoa why are u trying to jinx this? did brendan pay u to tweet this? way too early
ClevTA,look at u using pro football reference queries. someone had to of done that search for u lol
ClevTA,yessir. at first i did a double take then when u dig into the numbers thats extremely fair
ClevTA,whoa i had no idea morey was in hot water. crazy if this is how his tenure ends
ClevTA,u cant risk that u have to keep him as far away from a  field goal  as possible
ClevTA,just drove by the muni lot and there has to be 50 cars already lined up. insane #browns
CizzlingSports,hi rob any interest in seeing clay's actual  college football  betting records over the past 3 seasons? lmk
CizzlingSports,actually what's false is that  is at 52.4 percent  on the picks he sells to his vip subscribers
CizzlingSports,"how many playz does  have today? 

another required buy-in very possible for 17-week 01 and 17-week 02 subs"
CizzlingSports,"17-week packages are both down around -13 units

overall down around -5 units if you include all weeks"
CizzlingSports,and yet there you are congratulating him on the fake bets that dont matter like everything else apparently
CizzlingSports,"lmao so the picks you do for   are...worthless?

but we already know this

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,crazy right? i mean why doesnt an want you to see  and  all-time records?  i do not know
CizzlingSports,"i do not know  but worldwidewob is apparently now an  nba ""expert"" and his pick is tor +2.5!"
CizzlingSports,actually i was trying to think of the few good lines that  daily fantasy sports  need any editing
spanky,i personally dont handicap props. i have a few prop guys who work that part of our betting.
spanky,free plays offered on deposit are clear.  refunding bad beats arbitrarily depending on their chart will cause mayhem.
spanky,"i love the enthusiasm.  ass flash was hilarious. 

dodger houston parlay win. houston dodger parlay win.  

very entertaining..."
spanky,an auto mover (pinny and cris both have) will solve that issue.  i cant even bet online there.
spanky,"what are the ""regular limits"" for mlb money line?  need to know how much i should bring. thanks!"
spanky,vegas of yesterday is very different than today. to make a living betting sports betting offshore is required.
spanky,im not surprised in the least. ive been limited and kicked out more than it rains in seattle.
spanky,november  october seems surprising just by the number of betable options being far greater in november than october...
spanky,good to be at  - a place that wont ban me for winning or betting a good line
DocBettor,worth it at that number! the book where i bet it is down to +49500 i'd pass there

aluckyaday,2 out of 10 is quite impressive. its just as hard to be bad as it is good
aluckyaday,ok that does it for me. you have just shown you have no understanding of probability at all.
aluckyaday,as marco has said he does not judge his traders on the closing line because they set it.
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  think there is one. eurosport italia showing france. its on rai 2 from 2.15

LockyLockerson,good thing i got 3.5 points of closing line value that will look sick on my balance sheet.
EliHershkovich,not like houston's offense is helping but washington's 3-pt shooting failing to regress in this tournament is mind-boggling.

RufusPeabody,i'm 100 percent  with you on that. just not sure the committee will view it that way.
RufusPeabody,so it sounds like the limiting factor to his upside is his decision-making pocket management and accuracy.

RufusPeabody,im actually watching this game (well the last 20 minutes of real time) and its quite exciting
RufusPeabody,zero chance i could beat james holzhauer  or the worst contestant ever for that matter  on jeopardy.

SportsCheetah,he said last night to keep it open for mlb next season so we'll fire something up

SportsCheetah,definitely not that. each team 5/18 from 3 and pacers 33 percent  overall. pace has been there.
SportsCheetah,he may be valuing win against okie state's backup qb as significant enough to leap utah tuesday.
SportsCheetah,i made a similar bet on northwestern 1q -7 as well which was also surprisingly cheap imo.
SportsCheetah,hahaha austin rivers just told his dad hell call him as doc was ejected from the game.
SportsCheetah,the rockets averaged 14.9 seconds per possession last season. through the first half tonight they're at 11.3.
SportsCheetah,just 3 points or not that was nearly 7 minutes of the 30 remaining. well done kid.
SportsCheetah,the aztecs are averaging 3rd and 9.8 yards to go nearing the end of the first half.

capjack2000,and the people setting the betting limits have to wait until 1am for the games to start!
capjack2000,could you provide proof of that? afaik the calculation is (tickets written) - (tickets cashed) = (revenue)
capjack2000,hmmm...that doesn't seem right. line hasn't been better than 55/1 anywhere i've seen. 100/1 is easily scalpable.

suuma810,cj mosley out as expected. total in the ravens game 45.5/46. will be decent closing line value
suuma810,patriots/lions total opened at 46 has been bet up to 53.5/54 now. move of over a touchdown.
suuma810,probably too early yeah. but i didn't like the giants pick at all at the time though.
ClevTA,i found 2 but they werent 20 degrees they were 30 degrees. top 2 on the list
ClevTA,pretty sick over here so there wont be a  thursday night football  preview. i took under 45
ClevTA,this isnt the nba. trading or letting a star go in mlb is the only correct answer
ClevTA,how the hell did we miss out on this?? id watch every game if we had ja.
ClevTA,totally agree they should run more.  it its not bc cinci has the worst rush d lol
ClevTA,its more about potential baker hand issues + browns motivation questions than anything about the bengals imo
ClevTA,my tweet was if i was in the committee and had to make the argument for osu.
ClevTA,my guess is shes calling herself a star and hoping it didnt rain while doing pregame reports
ClevTA,somebody plz send me clay travis dumb blood bank picks. i need something to fade today thx
ClevTA,only booger would think a black cat on the field is the funniest thing of all time
ClevTA,hopefully u arent going to be doing this every night. i dont even bet the nba much
ClevTA,something doesnt feel right about damion ratley leading the browns in *rz targets last week with 4
ClevTA,u are able to isolate the differences right? one move could be trash and the other brilliant
ClevTA,least u could do is run it back with a monday night football  dk tourney. redeem yourself
ClevTA,yeah tampa can stop running up the middle on every first down. its nauseating and not working
ClevTA,rams certainly helps that overall number but yeah with browns talent at wr 75 percent  sounds right
ClevTA,i barely watched the game but is malzahn allergic to 2 point conversions or what actually happened

12Xpert,mind you given that it was ladbrokes pretty much anything they say and do is horse shit.
12Xpert,1.95/1.95 for example are the same. for this exercise favourite was simply the player with shorter odds.
12Xpert,sorry for late reply. the latest fixtures were there. maybe you need to clear your browser cache.
12Xpert,no favourite-longshot bias. here's a bit more explanation for why it might not be present at exchanges.
12Xpert,i market might be inefficient if the bookmaker can make more money by having it that way.
12Xpert,if i knew those trends and no one else knew them i'd be a very rich man.
12Xpert,"for football yes. explained here longish read:

other big sports/leagues probably yes too.  offer a subscription package."

JambosPicks,the #cubs and #phillies went a combined 1-17 with risp tonight. so much for that over  #gamblingtwitter
mschwimer,nope. the 17 week subscribers would be extremely profitable right now. they would get 10k from us.
mschwimer,not at all financed by bla. financed seperately. as i have said several times. completely different companies.
mschwimer,i have done this successfully with minor league baseball players. visit  if you want to learn more.

RufusPeabody,hasn't he already been exposed? also he blocked me so can't see what he's up to
RufusPeabody,his answers arent as long. and no candidate attacks him so he never gets the rebuttal.
RufusPeabody,you know who did show up? cornell which knocked off unbeaten dartmouth as a 30-point dog.
RufusPeabody,and are we forgetting that mclaughlin made the higher pressure kick at the end of regulation
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  think there's a standard way. that was the point of the poll.
RufusPeabody,this is why it makes so much sense for small cap bettors to attack smaller markets.
RufusPeabody,even if the stake is out of line with the edge. but  that is  just expectation.
RufusPeabody,i have heard will hill in jersey is much more accepting of action than in nevada.
RufusPeabody,is the market inefficient enough that you can win (or lose) just based on that though?
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  remember winning any via a collapse like any of those i mentioned.
RufusPeabody,yes i know the case very well seth. it was a money grab. pure and simple.
RufusPeabody,im also 7 feet tall have an iq of 300 and can bench press 400 pounds
RufusPeabody,when not an independent podcast? that way he doesn't have to help you grow your audience.
RufusPeabody,imagine how good the seahawks offense would be if they treated every play like third down.

jeffma,this implies hrc with roughly a 69 percent  chance to win according to the gambling markets
jeffma,i love that bob costas is surprised that mark reynolds has struck out 4 times #justanotherthursday
jeffma,i love this so much  rip to matthew dellavedova and his terrible beautiful lob passes .co/nftpkmozdw

jeffma,xavier/st. johns game screwed up... and this one cannot be chalked up to the obscure category
jeffma,selective memory huh? spread was 7.5 and i had the pats -6.5. check the tape :)
SportsCheetah,62 percent  from 3 vs 13 percent  from 3 on 26 and 22 attempts is wild
SportsCheetah,the wizards just shot 81 percent /100 percent /100 percent  in the 1q against the pistons.
SportsCheetah,i really had to rewind it because i didnt understand how kcp suddenly had the basketball
SportsCheetah,1h under 110 take a lap... 3 made 3s the 50 seconds before this one too.
SportsCheetah,prob better next week with more teams already clinched or not more rivalry game variance etc.
SportsCheetah,are kids practicing taking grounders in the outfield these days for shift purposes later in life?
SportsCheetah,turns out it was postle that shut the lights off late in the 4q of temple-ecu.
SportsCheetah,i bet the bengals but not at the current number. would pass on the game now.
SportsCheetah,i'd wait on it still -4 a lot of places so your book may go back.
capjack2000,by that logic if draftkings didnt have to pay kambi massive overhead you wouldnt be limited.

dinkinc,nah...  i'm funny ... he is serious ...i ask questions.....he gives opinions ...i'm more gilbert gottfried
dinkinc,going to try to do the impossibe and bet a lukas firster ...saratoga race 8   #5
dinkinc,he is one of those guys who get overlooked and there is no explanation for it
dinkinc,that was sad.... when a trainer hopes his horse will run third you kinda know something
dinkinc,he was a legend in his field.... never heard a bad word about him.... game changer...
robpizzola,daily fantasy sports  let the door hit you in the ass on the way out shane.
robpizzola,even when adjusting for schedule their opponent yards per play and success rate numbers were elite.
robpizzola,thx for watching. i hope you can look back on these periscopes fondly when youre homeless.
robpizzola,i think shes referring to your looks and maybe not your character  i do not know
robpizzola,might need to use my one time on a bengals backdoor to salvage the early games.
robpizzola,obj with such a smart play after this int. brilliant even though it didnt work out.
robpizzola,whenever youre down two  touchdown s with three minutes left you gotta keep the defense honest.
robpizzola,whenever you can throw eight yards short of the sticks on third-and-10 you gotta do it.
robpizzola,he was known as the billy walters of wnba until  recently went on a 69-0 run.
robpizzola,now who's going to tell us where every player on every team played their junior hockey?
robpizzola,wait... you think baseball is dying in part because managers are allowed to argue with umpires?
robpizzola,dybala is completely wasted at both club level and national level and i cant understand why.
robpizzola,pens won the cup with one d-man two years ago. people are very quick to forget.

robpizzola,if you didn't place a bet on it i  daily fantasy sports  want to know you.
robpizzola,donskoi just took the biggest hit ive ever seen in my life. this game is insane.
robpizzola,i think  is the only market maker that still is betting on hockey through the playoffs.
RASPicks,the market currently doesn't believe a word the guy is saying. that much we already know.
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  believe that was a real line or something you could have bet on.
RASPicks,cris/pinn are obviously great books just not for following ras.  typically both are the fastest movers.
RASPicks,"you can ""take a bet"" without agreeing on terms and conditions.  none were ever agreed to."
RASPicks,it can be a challenge for all levels of bettors.  service is definitely not for everyone.
RASPicks,almost exclusively 1.0 but on very rare occassions (about 5 percent  of plays) 1.5 or 2.0.
RASPicks,hoopsedge wnba service has beaten the closing line (+1.93 average) on all 44 releases this season.
RASPicks,#1 rule:  anyone selling picks that contacts you by phone should be stayed far away from.

suuma810,"got titans at +121 and they are currently -117 at pinny.

LeeSharpeNFL,"love the bears went for that 4th and 7 in packers territory.

wish it had worked."
LeeSharpeNFL,no that would be fairly straightforward to do. obviously  it is  hou/ten and pit/buf this week.
LeeSharpeNFL,this. strength of schedule is the first tiebreaker for draft picks (this is different from playoffs).
LeeSharpeNFL,"obviously you and i know this to be true.

i'm not convinced pace has accepted this."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i've made this joke about like 10 qbs.

but god i hope  it is  not mariota."
LeeSharpeNFL,why would you line up like that on 3rd and 1? not even threatening the run?

RufusPeabody,i can understand people getting banned for betting blatant mistakes  for what  it is  worth
RufusPeabody,wins are a predictive stat too. but i wouldnt use them in building a model.

RufusPeabody,tom brady and i have combined for 6 super bowl titles. also true. also misleading.
RufusPeabody,that was exactly my point.  that is  why  it is  so simple in this case!
RufusPeabody,i'm not talking about what he has done. i'm talking about their relative expectations now.
RufusPeabody,i literally wouldn't have money left to bet while i waited for my huge refund.
RufusPeabody,going forward we're going to try to get the podcast out on wednesdays every week.
RufusPeabody,nice win! and i sincerely hope you keep feeding money into the golf betting market.

capjack2000,"fair point. replace ""regulators"" with ""legislators"" in my tweet. the sentiment is the same though."
capjack2000,im having trouble visualizing how this helps smaller companies or consumers. maybe im missing something?
capjack2000,yes on gross gaming revenue. in pa they can subtract the promotional credits before tax.
capjack2000,at least if sports ever falls through well both be welcome back to play blackjack.
capjack2000,the dw game is 99.73 percent . the bonus poker deluxe is 99.64 percent .
capjack2000,i dont think the world needs more gambling buzzsaws. give the people a fair gamble.
capjack2000,sorry no. part of the value is that nothing would be shared from the event.
capjack2000,great...now the nj dge is going to be tracerouting my ip for the next year.
capjack2000,let us  say for every million you win there's this guy betting the other side...
capjack2000,since dk will probably delete their tweet...here's the screenshot for posterity (they forgot a 0):
capjack2000,that reminds me i need to campaign for a nj book to offer if bets.
capjack2000,good point. those futures arent necessary. they dont change enough to warrant the real estate.
capjack2000,better than the other two outs you have in the state so far. solid shop.
dinkinc,yes. yes. no.  yes.  yes.   i just dont get the fiend.  supernatural wrestling is crap
dinkinc,i agree.   with  its sad . nothing after that.  first time i agree with you
dinkinc,idiot.  worse than those that were assassinated .. probably doesnt know that bit of history
dinkinc,this is the new way of watching raw.. asking people if you should watch it...
dinkinc,yup. never know what to do with those clunkers.  tampa has them too.  bettors nightmares
dinkinc,rams came back to st.l for a teams reunited and the falcons have no defense
dinkinc,i bet the 5 because caton left him out.... also he is live in exotics
dinkinc,you forgot a word... so hard for trump supporters to write a complete sentence ...
dinkinc,tap his head a few times then tap his but once.  that works for hazel

robpizzola,yeah it was shit flag. doesnt change the fact that this was a great throw.
robpizzola,i prefer to note the fact that this is steam chasing at its absolute finest.
robpizzola,my laptop is two floors about me right now. id imagine i need -4.5 +100.
robpizzola,"these guys traded up for trubisky

...in a draft with patrick mahomes and deshaun watson"
robpizzola,the ghost of tony is getting wrecked with jags texans and titans futures right now.
robpizzola,can't leave those losing tennis plays up when you're gearing up for a tout run.
robpizzola,from the looks of those win totals they are assuming the rfas get signed yeah.
robpizzola,sad thing is that there are people so desperate that they will actually do this.
robpizzola,gonna give up on sports betting (i stink anyways) and become a full-time nature photographer.
robpizzola,if anyone wants side bets on this hop in my dms. i need the action.
robpizzola,wholeheartedly agree with this. my first thought went i got downtown today was oh boy....
robpizzola,totally worth a rewatch and as crazy as it sounds i will like rewatch again.
robpizzola,i'm scared that you'd drive us one sixth of the country in the wrong direction!

suuma810,great breakdown of the browns offense under freddie kitchens by  you will enjoy this piece.
suuma810,todd haley calling a league-high 48 percent  runs on 2nd  10+ isn't helping him either.
suuma810,you would assume that 10-23  5-19 against the spread gotta regress in the near future.

PlusEVAnalytics,this is the pre-match version of what ive been neglecting to work on in-match.
PlusEVAnalytics,real or not every sentence in that article is more repulsive than the last.
PlusEVAnalytics,all english at t shirt time. i thought you guys had laws about this.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah some combo without explicitly prescribing weights is the worst thing it could be.
PlusEVAnalytics,(british accent) this meeting of the dubious goals committee will now come to order
PlusEVAnalytics,really? that seems pretty exploitable (as youre likely finding out). what are the bonuses?

aluckyaday,detecting that something exists is very different to predicting a close to random event.
aluckyaday,a lot more if you had got him to turn around before taking it
aluckyaday,scrap that. it is. should have been comparing that to the first chart. doh...
aluckyaday,looks like there will be no selections today. my betfair api has stopped working!
aluckyaday,have average margins changed over time? might be worth showing those if they have.
aluckyaday,amazing results. baseball betting must be so easy. surprised there are any bookmakers left
aluckyaday,or much worse they may have crossed the fine line between entertainment and  addiction.
aluckyaday,actually i'm only looking at your last one. did any of the others survive?

mschwimer,we are more than a $100m company. please please please do you me research.
mschwimer,they are quoted in the bloomberg article. its not me saying it. its them.
mschwimer,if we open up an escrow account for you will you 100 percent  subscribe?
mschwimer,true. which is sad because the majority of the public doesnt understand sample size!

RufusPeabody,also this is record dating back to february before they started selling picks.
RufusPeabody,favorite part of my monday morning routine: listening to  and  on  nfl podcast.
RufusPeabody,""" had 1 goal when started.  to provide financial value for our subscribers."""
RufusPeabody,yep. recorded it this morning. waiting for our producer to get it up.
RufusPeabody,are you sure you're the right person to be commenting on this jeff?
RufusPeabody,i picked a helluva week to be off the grid. gambling twitter was
RufusPeabody,oh i missed the part that they can only bet on the exchange
RufusPeabody,more than just smells funny. this is old fashioned corruption plain and simple.
RufusPeabody,it is serious. lets just say i get a lot down. mostly matchups.
RufusPeabody,well id hope the podcast is moving them toward that way of thinking
RufusPeabody,nice of you to say dinky but i am in no way deserving.
RufusPeabody,using a more normal variance estimate it came in under half a percent
RufusPeabody,4 percent  over thousands of picks a year is a pretty nice living!
RufusPeabody,can't be a for-profit entity. plain and simple. has to be a nonprofit.
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  think ras and i have interacted in many months
RufusPeabody,does that change the point i'm making. i'm making a very general point.
RufusPeabody,highlight of #ssac20 so far: my fiance discussing wedding planning with mike leach.
RufusPeabody,hey i diversified today and tweeted about his comrade in arms vegas dave.
RufusPeabody,do the ravens know they can't use their timeouts in the second half?
RufusPeabody,subs that are not happy with the service are not reading the emails!!

capjack2000,nor was i. i'm glad to see the evolution for future bettors though.
capjack2000,then its odd that theyd update their tc and highlight that now no?
capjack2000,its not quite jack buck calling kirk gibson but this was pretty funny.
capjack2000,spent all game 7 refreshing my timeline looking for the answer to this...????

capjack2000,where is ? can't forget nj's only casino branded after a strip club.

dinkinc,adam fox on fire....last time i saw him he was two years old
dinkinc,good to see you too. looking forward to watching some games with you

dinkinc,is it true you will be an entry in todays battle royal ?
dinkinc,if you can consistently lose to the closing line you can consistently lose
robpizzola,possibly. but when looking around the league hes still in the upper echelon.
robpizzola,really can't believe that another questionable patriots player is going to suit up.
robpizzola,i hope fortunato takes you for a deep drive out into the desert.
robpizzola,saints defense will trade five yards for for 40 seconds all night long.
robpizzola,will definitely make it easier to swallow the rest of todays losers lol
robpizzola,i think maybe after the ravens drive the field for a  touchdown  here.
robpizzola,you know who has a worse o-line? the guy he just lost to.
robpizzola,kershaw full blown piss pants in a playoff game? who would have guessed?
robpizzola,i wish i loved anyone as much as scott hanson loves hollywood brown.
robpizzola,do you give them 25 percent  of the losses if the pick loses?
robpizzola,lol these guys fly private jets they spend 30 seconds going through customs.
robpizzola,i dont have the slightest idea who is a market maker right now.
robpizzola,leclerc doing all he can... such a shame that the ferrari broke down.
robpizzola,i could watch spieth piss his pants on that back nine 100x over
robpizzola,archer -118 because losing money on weekday afternoon baseball is an absolute must.
RASPicks,yeah it was our first overall losing season in 20+ years very disappointing.
RASPicks,"you said ""flooded"" assume that puts it at over/under 25ish?  will try under."
RASPicks,ncaa thursday:  735 mich st/delaware over 150.5  (one more in a few minutes)

suuma810,imagine having the future mvp but kicking the  field goal  on 4th  1.
suuma810,you are mixing up qbr  passer rating which are two completely different metrics.
suuma810,dazu kommt dass sie die bolts und eagles mit miesen injuries erwischt haben.
