ClevTA,th against the spread a diff topic. i said from the beginning as long as u are ok going for 2 and the win its smart. if u dont like that then no u wouldnt like going for 2 down 8.  but understand theres years of data and math that has been analyzed here. its n overtime a decision on a whim
ClevTA,wasted a pick on tyrod the  waste two picks on callaway. keep doing that and see where it gets u. the point is he was a shit head at florida and he was off many boards but u still decide to n overtime only dra free throw  him u trade a pk. this isnt using a 6 on tyreek. its bad business
ClevTA,den 3rd best in nfl v pass in 11 (5.7 ypa 39 percent  success rate). against the pass in 12 den has allowed 8.5 ypa  49 percent  success rate.this screams more 12 from browns. i get freddie is trying to prove he deserved to get hired with fancy plays/em point y sets but this is the gm to grind out a w
ClevTA,im wary of about 90 percent + of all trends bc they are mostly data mining unless there is solid reasoning behind it. a) id want to know this exact situation where the team is also favored in that gm off  monday night football . b) also is this negated bc gb is off a short week vs team off a bye?

aluckyaday,i like simple  i've heard the 4 percent  losers being restricted is more a trader thing than a book policy. watch lists get too big. the easy way to remove people from  years old you are list is to restrict them. also when you have a 7 percent  hold bonus target a high staking 4 percent  loser is no good to you!
aluckyaday,this is the kind of analysis you need to do on  years old you are own models/picks n overtime those of a tout. when you go to a doctor do you ask for all the supporting evidence to back up their diagnosis or trust their opinion? if you  daily fantasy sports  trust the tout (probably correct for most)  daily fantasy sports  buy!
aluckyaday,you have only given 3 years of results. 1 of 88 monkeys would do as well as you over those 3 years. if you have more data then fine. but we can only go on what you show. the fact that you thought those 3 years data justified  years old you are ability when it does n overtime is a little worrying.
aluckyaday,anyone know how long boris has to call an election a free throw er the 14 days. could he just sit on his hands until a free throw er the 31st october? opens a constitutional can of worms. i would think if that is the case i hope someone would be able to enact jezzas plan if it can't be him himself.

12Xpert,but if zoom in on the k's that matter then you can see more clearly the impact of having a bit of skill. in this monte carlo run the 50 percent  bettor had a probability of 38.4 percent  of seeing a 10. for the 48 percent  bettor it was 44.1 percent . for the 52 percent  bettor it was 28.1 percent .
12Xpert,that is  why they were top class with you.  it is  a lesson punters should learn. if a so free throw  book doesn't restrict you and you are doing nothing to disguise  years old you are activity then this implies they think you are an idi overtime and a cash machine for them.  that is  fine if betting is just for fun.
mschwimer,"great week 1 in the books! even a free throw er paying o you are $250 1 week fee subs would have been +$2297 (using jambos system)

sign up for week 2 today to get the money back guarantee plus! signing up a free throw er 6pm subs n overtime eligible for money back plus! will have to wait until next week."
RufusPeabody,sorry if i'm being too general for  years old you are taste. can understand why you take issue with it. but exce point ions in this industry are few  far between and bettors make the mistake of paying for negative expected value picks from a losing tout faaaar more o free throw en than passing on a pick-seller who has value.
capjack2000,"i thought my post was a rare compliment to kambi. use the teaser+ to identify both good and bad teasers. 

teasing through the 0 is the cardinal sin of teasing. fair price of that teaser is about -115.  years old you are so free throw ware has a respectable 5 percent  hold on that at -129. -150 is awful i agree"
ClevTA,i dont know u from a hole in the wall but if i gave u unlimited cap space and the most valuable dra free throw  capital in nfl history u could win 6 games in the nfl as gm. he added some talent but was a terrible team builder. he wanted to give freddie one more  year which is a joke
ClevTA,huh? godwin without evans l assit week had 5-121 in one half before he g overtime hurt. all the st against the spread i tweeted shows the value add from the wr. most tackles avoided in the nfl top 10 in yac per rece point ion and first downs per target. most of that is wr doing it on his own.
ClevTA,i mean they can still win 9 games have a nice season and n overtime make the playoffs. brees wore down at the end of l assit year. who knows if that was precursor of his downfall but its a risk. they lose their c in unger  have zero wrs outside of mt. 2018 dra free throw  is far from proven
spanky,"well said. there is no easy path.  

compare it to cooking. you can try it yourself but youll never create top quality food. instead give the ingredients to a chef sit back and let him expertly pr expected points added re  years old you are meal. 

give me  years old you are outs sit back and watch the $$$ roll in."
spanky,hi eric. thanks for  years old you are contribution.  a books hold at -110 is 1/22 = 4.55 percent  .  (2 bets at 11 to 10   - book makes a buck with 22 in action). i think adding the players breakeven percentages of 52.4 and subtracting from 100  (52.4 + 52.4 -100 = 4.8 percent )  is quick and dirty method
aluckyaday,i would think 10 places each way is a loss leader for them even at 185 percent ! looked at the top 48 on datagolf yesterday (at best price from the 10 places bookies) and using datagolf projections 32 out of 48 were + expected value for an each way bet. backing them all an expected roi of 50 percent !!!
aluckyaday,if sharps could bet with them they would bet so free throw  books as well! the props are easy to pick off and as a collective they o free throw en offer less margin than sharps. but their terms and conditions  daily fantasy sports  let sharps bet. it is the most profitable way to run a book and losers are happy.
EdMillerPoker,take 2 bets -150 on one side and +150 on the other. sum of positive expected value of those bets is 0 by def. therefore also by def one is + expected value and one is -ev. if you can do any better than random at picking the + expected value one out then  years old you are strategy is +ev.
nonrandomalpha,we sound stupid ripping o you are rivals when we g overtime o you are own serious issues. look how well run bama is; th against the spread how uf football should be and used to be. we are a powerhouse school that continually falls flat on its face. oh but in all kinds of weather right? stop blaming the weather
LeeSharpeNFL,"one of the famous players in the game i work on said (i'm paraphrasing) ""a l overtime of success in this game is having the discipline to make the 55 percent  decision even when it hit the 45 percent  the l assit 3 times you were in that spot.""

adamchernoff,on the cin game i know that arz is n overtime going to be a huge draw in the situation so considering what could come in on cin off of an extreme result i'd need to go high enough to make arz appealing to sharper players. likely a 5.5 or so or -6 off a really extreme  monday night football  result.
12Xpert,"n overtime as smart as you at obviously.

mschwimer,"if a bettor bets at mgm and wants to know his closing line value for that specific bet. should he

c) use the mgm line and compare that to pinny close?"
RufusPeabody,milo can have a model that wins longterm that has +7 -110 as a 1.5 percent  edge. coco can have a model that wins longterm that has -7 -110 as a 1.5 percent  edge. they dont both have an edge on the game (obvi) but th against the spread n overtime logically inconsistent with models that win lt generating both
capjack2000,"worth pointing out that if given a free money wager like this you  daily fantasy sports  want to bet it on a heavy favorite anyway.

aluckyaday,sports betting is n overtime new. the rest of the world have been doing it forever! there is n overtime going to be a disru point ing force just because the us has joined the party. as it is going to be a highly regulated market i would expect it to follow europe and become so free throw  book dominated.
aluckyaday,if you want to test how likely  years old you are returns are due to skill you can use this excellent calculator here  set f2 to average odds f3 to zero f6 to number of bets g10 to  years old you are actual roi and f10 will give you the chance of  years old you are roi occurring by chance.

TheKostos,"remember the old nfl record  fact book that came out a free throw er every season? i used to read them front to back.

DannyParkins,"yea i have no problem with that conce point ually the ""until you get somebody better part"" is where i'd wanna talk. bc if you have a qb you have to be that conservative with you can't pay him big $$ like eli in  years old you are example imo so id move on from a guy like that asap."
Gingfacekillah,really depends on  years old you are starting point and how hard you work at it. the first time you look at a coding console it can be intimidating. just start trying things and running bits of code in help files and examples from github. i whipped this up about one month into r  for what  it is  worth .
Gingfacekillah,you'll notice a l overtime of people happily post forec assits but you  daily fantasy sports  do much analysis when they lose. i watch every game i select. i analyze the data a free throw er each game. i try to find ways to correct model deficiencies as a result of this new info. there's a lesson in there somewhere

PikachuBets,you are all talk and no bite. if we didnt point out  years old you are horrific mistakes then  years old you are tos makes no of the guarantee and keeps all liability claims to a bare minimum. $500? gotta be joking. that wasnt a typo. that was an attem point  to scam and you g overtime exposed. credibility? 0
PikachuBets,name a fucking price for  years old you are -800 bet and i will send you a screen recording of me clicking through the links i sent to him from my dms and show you the tabs that open up. then you can google the two places and see for yourself then publicly owe me money youll never pay. deal?
PikachuBets,pika voice of reason:  daily fantasy sports  rip sammie for losing. if you wanna make fun of him so many other great targets e.g. $500 tout no market knowledge wrong closing line value formula fading steam late etc. but  daily fantasy sports  give him shit for such a short losing streak. bide  years old you are time. lol ty ty
adamchernoff,i think judging by how gruden shut down the game yesterday at 6:00 le free throw  in the 3q there is probably a l overtime of game planning that has been done already - and will be put in this week too. but 50 runs at 5.0+ ypc into the weakness of the kc d wouldn't be the worst idea.
adamchernoff,well i would say that teams  daily fantasy sports  control who they play but do control how they play. vanity metrics show smu is 0-3 against the spread  vs three bottom 120 opponents but in each low handle game with an inflated price on smu they g overtime out to leads that exceeded the closing price late in the 2h.

VegasRefund,its wild that the decision to move the mex game should be a no brainer if the game was actually what mattered when it probably wont cuz of money and the teams will suffer. both teams have byes next week but since its on  monday night football  moving the game back a week deff isnt an o point ion.
ClevTA,the net success rate during that stretch is just as bad. the yds/play is all i had at my finger tips. totally get that russ is a diff animal but sea was down 26-14 w/5m le free throw  in the 4th v sf. its pretty fluky time even get to that l assit second play with chance to win
ClevTA,then the bottom half of the league plays each other in a s expected points added rate bracket.  it is  n overtime perfect but i like the idea that guys  will play hard bc u can move up in the standings with each win. also obv some $ incentive involved as well. some random mid season trophy is meaningless
ClevTA,eh to say something like he likes the skins line of attack im n overtime so sure considering jets run d is best in the nfl. also maybe its bc im an osu grad but i know haskins inside  out  he shouldnt be on an nfl field right now. making skins throw bc of the run d was ideal
ClevTA,9 times out of 10 based on circumstances the browns would be a an obvious sp overtime to win but this short week from the west co assit travel vs a team playing on  thursday night football   really screws things up for them. its too bad bc this is typically an ideal sp overtime vs an overrated seattle tm
ClevTA,"every time i think ive seen every crazy hue stat i find a new one :
when hue was fired the browns had a to margin of +11 but went 2-5-1. since 1990 there have been 42 teams that had a to margin of 11+ thru 1st 8 gms. any guesses to what other teams were also under .500?"
CizzlingSports,".upd8: l assit 2  years clay released  college football  picks to subs on sun night  then to the plebes on wed. tracked  posted l assit 2 years above. clay obv saw bc he then responded to q's re: his real records.

 college football  2019 wk1 released to subs on 8/18. cant seem to find the public release now tho?"
spanky,i could see that happening here and there but n overtime for 3000 bets.   years old you are tipped odds has a higher yield than the closing line so you are beating the closing line.  as  years old you are following grows and more money gets pumped in the market the closing line will yield a near 0 earn
spanky,"if youre n overtime betting and just a tipster then  years old you are point is mo overtime as the market is unaware of  years old you are presence.

if youre actually betting these for limits at posttime pinny would eventually catch on to  years old you are success and move hard and you would beat the closing line."
spanky,i hired an employee 9 years ago right out of princeton university. sharp as a tack. he was into competitive pi reciting.  i never even heard of that till i met him.  he le free throw  my company a free throw er a few years and moved out west to work for some joint named google. happy pi day!
spanky,many moons ago i used to play into a local in la and he always inflated the lakers/clippers line.  same conce point  with a local here in ny with the knicks/nets. if consensus was lakers -5 vs knicks - i would be able to bet the knicks +6 in la and lakers -4 in ny. i miss those days
aluckyaday,that really is the point! we have no way of telling if that statement is true from the published records. i bet a l overtime of people would be surprised if you were to say i used to tip soccer but i was so useless at it pychio deleted my tips! imho deleting tips can n overtime be defended.
aluckyaday,i have n overtime looked at it but... over round is dependent on time before race and the race makeup so even if you have valid data it is very difficult to compare races. at the most competitive time in the uk you can o free throw en bet close/better than 100 percent . does that happen in australia?
EdMillerPoker,so for a -110 bet its 110/210 = 0.524 or 52.4 percent . th against the spread how o free throw en the bet has to win to break even. then say the  moneyline is -180. that break even is 180/280 = 0.643 or 64.3 percent . so theres 64.3 percent  - 52.4 percent  = 11.9 percent  between these.
GolcondaFund,the bills with peterman have no chance. with j. allen fits what they want to do. poor passer only second year needs legs and big plays to be worth  years old you are qb. he is literally tebow 2.0 but he will get 3-5 years to test if he can improve - organization bought in + n overtime polarizing
GolcondaFund,"""lock of the week"" on a line 4-6 points over inflated because a team looked good having all off season to pr expected points added re for the worst team in the history of the nfl. come on now. browns sweep their division and are at 7 wins + tie breakers. and dolphins 8 cardinals 9 den buff 10.."
GolcondaFund,"curious if you think you and the team g overtime #mcvayed by over thinking the l assit two weeks of gold contest. 
#georgeking had 3 losses down the stretch. titans -9.5 wk 16  years old you are weak sp overtime 38.1 percent  on year was home favorites. almost sucked out with pick 6 but bad sp overtime and #.."
JoeyKnish22,yeah its n overtime the worse decision ive ever seen. but the combo of only 4th and 5 in the redzone the wind bowl game yolo. a  field goal  there sets you up best case to tie with 2 more scores. i personally would have went for it but ive seen much much worse game mgt decisions than that.
JoeyKnish22,"couple house cleaning items:
1) if youre n overtime paid by the first game youre out and we delete  years old you are entry. period. 
2) if you miss/forget a pick th against the spread on you. dont ask. no exce point ions. you should pick every game right away then you can go back and change before kickoff."
DannyParkins,yea i disagree a threat of what? that happens all the time in sports that mitch gets feedback on stuff we say from teams. its his job to shield us from it or admonish us if we stepped over a line that he deems to be o you are editorial standard. teams reach out to bosses all the time
DannyParkins,i gave 2 to a father/daughter on the train in a sox hat so i only le free throw  a pair to this saturdays #whitesox game near dearborn  polk on the bar louie deck... however i le free throw  $20 cash so  years old you are first beer is on me. its a jose abreu bobble head game. go!
logan_matthews9,"a little birdie told me he might just pick old lines but yeah even if he was truly picking every current line at best hes even on a majority of games. 

but to  years old you are point yeah you arent doing this at $200 a game. youd need to be maxing bonuses and they mostly top at $1000"
PikachuBets,did you just compare jumbo bozos to billy walters. they  daily fantasy sports  move the market. they  daily fantasy sports  bet their own picks. there is nothing to fucking middle if you  daily fantasy sports  move the market. lol. dude you can't read espn chalk articles  use these fancy words when you  daily fantasy sports  know what they mean
PikachuBets,i learned this the hard way. used to live bet to chase  lost slightly vig. but i looked back at how much of life i missed out on by uselessly sweating those plays and the answer became clear. if  it is  n overtime clear get someone to help you see it thru.  daily fantasy sports  live this life alone
PikachuBets,yes as always its the non-gambler on his high horse laughing at smart bettors taking advantage of so free throw  markets. go ahead and judge all the sharp movers who steamed lmu -4 to -7 and saw them demolish brown by 18  points . theyre making much more money than you ever will at  years old you are job
PikachuBets,get a clue guy. situational trends have no predictive value. none zilch. but even if they did betting anything blindly without considering the price or positive expected value will make you lose  years old you are ass off. if trends were useful you wouldn't have to use a new one every other week for  years old you are plays.
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  think so. it was my first chance to be on a national show which i think is pretty neat considering where i started. i did my best to present the games my way and hope the listeners gained some value from me and g overtime the chance to think about betting in a different way.
adamchernoff,land based sports books which is what i think is the perce point ion for many in the us based off of las vegas. they are creating web shops. the biggest issue is their web based product is even worse and they do n overtime push that either. in my eight hours there i did n overtime get one...
adamchernoff,"they do n overtime know the odds? everyone in the ""restaurant"" must lean over the bar to try get a glimpse. forget about it in vip. to make things even worse the place does n overtime have sound! i have never been to a sports book that does n overtime have sound and it is baffling. you can hear..."

mschwimer,o you are system is based on subscribers betting $300 per play. they can do whatever we want. but o you are system is based on that number. $300 is easy to get down on the plays we post. feel free to check all o you are plays on o you are site. everything is available to the public.
mschwimer,great question. we are using market consensus lines and we have a full write up on what to do if that happens in o you are faqs. we also have o you are record vs. closing lines and its very similar to o you are market line record. something like +177 units vs. +145 units over almost 3000 picks.
SportsCheetah,ive hardly even touched baseball since football began so im sure as hell n overtime laying the big faves -140 or higher and i didnt even bet wnba yesterday. youre confusing who youre going a free throw er bud. saw a tweet the other night from you weds on a day i wasnt even on the show lol
capjack2000,"if you had the under 6.5 in the tor/phi nhl game well you may just see  years old you are bet on

capjack2000,pa g overtime operators to sign up...almost 5 months a free throw er they made the licenses available for sale it became a fomo thing once one signed up.  daily fantasy sports  forget the l assit 8 words of his quote. pa is the 3rd largest gambling jurisdiction in the us but they lack any innovation so far.
RASPicks,"with o you are ""set up  go"" release system you get 45 seconds with play in hand to set up  years old you are bets. all you then have to do is submit the final confirmation to beat the line move. here is a simulation of what monday's release of 253 indianapolis +1 (now -2.5 -115) looked like:"
ClevTA,if u asked me before bowl season which teams had the best chance to lose or n overtime cover purely based on lack of motivation i think the list would have been- utah miami pitt and bama. the first two looked awful and lost and pitt barely beat a bad mac tm. lets see if bama shows up
ClevTA,imo the ideal situation is the hc is a respected leader who is an adult and can be the ceo of the tm. pay up for innovative oc and dc and work with a beefed up analytics d expected points added rtment who can help steer the hc to make + expected value decisions. is that too simple?
spanky,everyone on that chart loves to play gambling twitter police. youre all so smart but most if n overtime all of you are just a bit shy of being good enough to bet for a living.  so you instead relieve  years old you are frustrations pointing out how stupid or wrong others are. you all can do better
spanky,pay  his money and  daily fantasy sports  even wait for a ruling from gaming.  going forward put a sign up at every teller window and a big banner of  years old you are max odds.  you bullshit the public on  years old you are treatment of winning sports bettors and now you try and rob the horse bettors.
spanky,"in the per head era we're in anyone can be a bookie.  mostly young broke college kids try and take a shot.  problem is they  daily fantasy sports  have the ability and/or honor to pay off winners.  to all you wanna be bookmakers: 
1.) its illegal to book offshore
2.) pay  years old you are debts or gtfooh"
spanky,im n overtime being arrogant just being real... im just tired of all the touts out there saying how great they are at gambling.  now you a media personality shout out  years old you are 60 percent  record on a radio show.  i bet real money with real bookmakers.  i really have to win to support my family.
spanky,tommy when i bet the line moves. i bet alot.  i  daily fantasy sports  ever see a situation where telling people what i am going to bet before i bet it as beneficial since i can lose my desired line.  the sports market is very thin and very limited.there are only a handful of line sets out there
PlusEVAnalytics,they did grind out a profit they were the original advantage players. when i said on the  podcast that if id been born 10-15  years earlier id be on an island they are the guys who are on that island. they are lucky the judge didnt know enough st against the spread to realize what was going on.
aluckyaday,definitely not. is the regulator being lenient or are the regulations n overtime up to scratch? maybe they need to be rewritten so there can be no ambiguity. a rule that can n overtime be enforced is n overtime a rule at all! or are you saying the regulator is n overtime enforcing perfectly acce point able rules
EdMillerPoker,"in two months hes going to have picked a zillion  college basketball  games won obv given his silly rules for his silly game and have a shiny double digit positive roi number (in just 17 weeks!) per this convo to take to every media outlet in america.

a free throw er that he will have subs for real."
LeeSharpeNFL,"if i were starting from scratch probably but given there's value in stability i'd stay with nagy i think.

nagy definitely does things i  daily fantasy sports  like but moore does too. i  daily fantasy sports  think the bears' real problem is nagy  it is  trubisky. i'd like to give nagy a sh overtime with a real qb."
LeeSharpeNFL,"that is  awesome good for them!

it does suggest they aren't worried about n overtime using ngs data for that reason though.

may be a core competency problem. they  daily fantasy sports  know how to use data. they  daily fantasy sports  know how to hire someone who is good. non-ado point ion is an easier path/use of time."
LeeSharpeNFL,"buf/ne was significant for both could have given buf a sh overtime at the division over ne.

gb/ minutes is in a same sp overtime  minutes still *can* take the division with a win  it is  ruled out if they lose.

no/ten matters no is chasing a bye still ten is still fighting pit for the #6 seed."
LeeSharpeNFL,"buffalo is the only team i think i put too low.

there are multiples (including sea) thst may be too high. i think sea is probably between the tier i had them at and the one below and ""rounded up"". their in game decision making is bad but they dra free throw  well with all the trade downs."
AndyMSFW,the shading is to just all-together keep you from betting a wong teaser. below you can see the middle book prices the giants at a pk rather than +2 taking it out of the zone where the teaser is o point imal.  n overtime only that but you're paying the same price to essentially move 4  points .
JoeyKnish22,"put together a low risk maybe zion gets hurt  nba roy card:
- garland 20/1 .25u
- white 25/1 .25u

- clarke 100/1 .1u
- grant williams 100/1 .1u
- pj wash 100/1 .1u
- goga 200/1 .1u

1.25u. this will n overtime win. but ive spent money on worse."
DannyParkins,the only way running it once and spiking the ball at the end of the first half or kneeling instead of trying to gain more yards at the end of a game makes a lick of sense is if you have zero trust in  years old you are qb. he's coaching scared because he's justifiably terrified of trubisky.
DannyParkins,i  daily fantasy sports  get why you'd extend jim boylen before the lottery. you're telling me if you get zion or ja this job isn't exponentially more attractive to the best and brightest? there's no rush. if you  daily fantasy sports  want boylen to be a lame-duck fine. extend him a free throw er you lose the lottery.
logan_matthews9,so this is how i set this up: i built the model on all matches that i had sh overtime data for (i believe starting in 2011) up until the end of the 2017 season. i built running xgds for both teams as well as home attendance and used that as the input. then i predicted on 2018
PikachuBets,but the school g overtime them there 1000 percent  easier. as a cu grad you must know this. if two guys are equally hardworking intelligent and n overtime entitled ceterus paribus the guy who went to elite school has a gigantic leg up. i  daily fantasy sports  see how you can refute this unless you're out of touch
PikachuBets,im trying my hardest. i cap during wee hours of the night a free throw er my busy day job while my cat runs all over the keyboard messing up my formulas. i watch every game on dvr at 0.5x speed in order to catch every little derailed nuance. the picks are fire; they are n overtime sarcastic
PikachuBets,years old you are hope is to tout 60 percent  in tiny sample nfl then sell a non-market tested first year mlb model for $500 and quit  years old you are job to be a frigging tout? if th against the spread what inspiration is to you then you really need to set the bar higher for yourself.
adamchernoff,"mindset of what was mentioned above or do a bulk of those people stay away falsely assuming this is the fictional ""trap spot""? the 49ers are also featured in a  monday night football  game at home vs seattle. how does perce point ion carry over and how do people view sf on a short week? for me these..."
adamchernoff,"most telling point is that nobody knows which ""sharps"" are on which game. if you do n overtime know which bettors were betting at which price and  years old you are goal is to blindly tail those bettors how can you risk money on the crutch of  years old you are reasoning being entirely unknown?!  it is  insane!"
adamchernoff,on a game at 3.5 (for example) and the favourite is at the high end of their range and the underdog is at the low end of their range it allows me to circle an entry point within the market better as the market tends to respond to what l assit occurred if it was an extreme result.
Ccon8181,haha classic   .. i cashed out a nationals bet for 18k and he came to the counter and asked if i wanted to bet it. i said no i g overtime killed today down 40k done for the day. he said you still have the night games to get it back then gave me a fist pump. lol

but thanks for making me think."
mschwimer,spoke with rufus on the phone. to clarify he subscribed to jambos during  college basketball  and saw some of those picks come in. he never unsubscribed but also didnt check the emails when he g overtime them and therefore cant verify o you are record. he had all the means to verify but did n overtime do so.
SportsCheetah,"while this was 0 percent  to ever get replayed anyway and i  daily fantasy sports  think the game should be replayed ""they had sufficient time to overcome the error"" is a strange stance to take on it. if it had happened with 0.2 seconds le free throw  in regulation to put houston up then they'd have agreed?"
SportsCheetah,huh? they were showing shots of the wind the entire time. look up a weather report. it was 16-21 miles per ho you are throughout the half. i quoted the over under numbers historically when winds are 12mph+. oregon also caught a bomb off ute dbs back and blocked a punt for 10 points. goes both ways.
SportsCheetah,"at the very le assit this can be used to  years old you are advantage betting in-game. i'm going to put together a ""cheat sheet"" of sorts with nuggets on every team that based on the data we have a quarter of the season in are causal: player/rotation extremes that fly under the radar a la jp."
SportsCheetah,"hawks led the nba in pace l assit season with 104.5 possessions per game.

24 nba teams in the preseason played at a pace of 104.5 to 112.8. 

now this was a preseason trend that started two years ago but n overtime at the level we just saw. 

may god have mercy on an under bettors soul."
SportsCheetah,if you dont get why the l assit 5 years stuff can be misleading i dont know what else to say. even using  years old you are won by an average of 20.7 ppg l5  3 of 5 were in clemson (and one was the we quit ville team)... theyre laying 24 on the road this saturday.
capjack2000,"i give him points for going outside the box and choosing a prop instead of a futures wager. $20 is weak sauce though. 

best wager imo is still gov markell of de who bet on the phillies to win that night as a +210 dog (won). ron jaworski a close 2nd for betting $100 on his bet."
dinkinc,then about an ho you are later joey posts a flyer for a halloween show with christina's picture..i realize  that is  the day before the breeders cup which was on my radar.. i went for the trifecta and lo and behold there is a kings game on the 30th.. hope to meet you and casey at bar...
dinkinc,so when i saw that bar was  years old you are first show i thought to myself that i haven't been there in quite sometime and wondered what would make me go { i live in las vegas }.. thought it would be only if he booked  or  since they are friends and never work vegas 1/2
dinkinc,what's to stop the books who copy lines from copying this... i know  it is  a short window of time... also if the square takes to these and starts making hundreds of bets instead of twenty he will go broke or get fed up pretty quickly. for me  it is  too f assit to understand my edges
dinkinc,there are a ton of good players even in the so free throw er events.  i g overtime to a final table in a bracelet event and there were two players there even worse than me. you are a high level player in a very variance driven game where weak players o free throw en get rewarded
suuma810,"gordon was on pace for 1400 yards once he g overtime the full time role. he's g overtime two full weeks before week one. bb is sold on him.

thomas went for 59-677-5 l assit year with 8 gms keenum and switching tms. i'll take that.

both guys have a catch radius brady dreams of at night."
suuma810,"i would argue that they can also play man with the fs hovering closer to the first down marker instead of back pedalling even deeper. a slant seems like an easy touchdown with the fs that deep.

i would expect the fs to be at le assit a threat to take away the middle of the field."
suuma810,it is  the market's confidence. chicago was a few plays away from going 16-0 and dvoa-wise they g overtime the best d since '13 sea. they have a good hfa which is also increased in the playoffs.  let us  say 4 points for hfa.  daily fantasy sports  you think they should be -2.5 on a neutral field?
ClevTA,th against the spread n overtime true at all. u dont understand how dead money works. hubbard has almost $10m alone that theyd eat if they cut him. u also are n overtime factoring in all the extensions that are coming up that u need to account for- myles chubb baker etc. but i appreciate the lesson
spanky,"back when i used to bet in vegas i had a few veterans betting in the casinos for me.

these guys knew the business and were always on time.

most importantly they were 100 percent  honorable; n overtime a dollar was ever missing.

thank you to all the veterans out there for  years old you are service"
spanky,he took on all comers and always paid. sweat the game n overtime the payout was his modo.  im n overtime ashamed to admit that my lifetime figure as a customer is big time negative.  he is one of the best bm ever. if there was a bookmakers hall of fame spiros would be first ballot. (2/2)
spanky,when bob stewart was still in business  years old you are guys and many others ripped out the code and stopped paying him. i code autobettors and know knockoffs. i never heard one person leave dgs for lack of quaility.   years old you are crap is a knockoff and dgs is number 1 plain and simple. #fridayfacts
spanky,"ask every tout ""why do you sell winners when you can just bet them yourself?""  i have the answer that no tout has - they won't let me bet them myself! however truth be told i rely on betting partners to get me accounts to bet offshore. i  daily fantasy sports  ever foresee that well drying out."
spanky,lots of you guys asking me wh against the spread the secret behind success.  i always respond by saying we outwork everybody.  i'm n overtime the sharpest i'm n overtime the smartest but no one works harder than my staff and i.  no matter what you do in life there is no substitution for hard work. (1/2)
aluckyaday,the fact that they pay him tells you all you need to know about the direction of the us industry. if some books manage to stick to a sharp model good luck to them but the business case for a so free throw  books is much stronger. in the end if corporate types are pulling the strings....
aluckyaday,its pretty simple really. sharp books are best for sharp players so free throw  books for recreationals. if you are an aspiring sharp start at the so free throw  books. if they restrict you you are doing things right time to move to a sharp book. if they let you play enjoy  years old you are betting!
aluckyaday,that is only correct if you are a losing punter. it works opposite to that if you have an edge. you are compounding the edge in  years old you are favour. for + expected value punters multiples will give a higher roi than singles that is a mathmatical fact. but the price you pay is larger drawdowns.
aluckyaday,n overtime that i've been in the uk for a while but i believe all written tickets are scanned in to a settlement system. it used to be a manual process someone at the back of the shop calculating returns for every ticket. you had to wait until  years old you are ticket was settled before collecting
aluckyaday,beating so free throw  books is easy. beating sharp books is close to impossible unless you have information they  daily fantasy sports . anyone who claims to be winning is most likely doing it with so free throw  books. if they are beating sharp books they should be doing it very discreetly and n overtime telling anyone!
aluckyaday,if what i am assuming is correct you could beat them by feeding better data to  years old you are model at opening but i doubt it would be because you had a better model. i think models are more useful to indicate when pinny may have moved away from the fair price to maximise their profit.
aluckyaday,if there is some truth in this then i'm sure william hill will be investigating. uk so free throw books have a history of trying to avoid paying out on third party bets. online tcs generally forbid it. is bearding legal in vegas? would they have to pay out if it were found to be the case?
joeytunes2,yes  years old you are 100 percent  right. but they beg for picks. so  that is  fine. if its entertainment purposes. so be it. but i'd rather be wrong and have an opinion then listen to anyone else. it feels good to win on  years old you are own. these hammerheads you pay for arent winners anyway.

anyone offering you a bet thinks they have the right side. you have to learn as much as you can about what makes them tick and why they think that. if you can figure out why theyre wrong you might have a bet."
EdMillerPoker,"i think the infrastructure will get there (esp for nfl  i do n overtime know  about  college football ...) and at that point ""up between plays"" will make plenty of sense.

nonrandomalpha,great stuff  very helpful info even for betting purposes n overtime only  daily fantasy sports . i still gotta dig into the st against the spread and game tape over the course of the week but love hearing hardman may be sneaking under the radar now and shocked cousins threw the ball only 10 times - wow.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah this is the real problem. my model doesn't have a conditional qb setting so i  daily fantasy sports  have the granualarity to say ""sim with rg3 if bal locks up #1 seed in week 16 sim with jackson if not"".

all these sims were assuming rg3 starts week 17 even though  that is  n overtime reality."
LeeSharpeNFL,"a year ago i posted this to facebook:

 i've made a l overtime mistakes in my life but it helps to remember that at le assit i've never kicked a field goal down 4 with 4:30 le free throw  in the game. 

no idea which coach it is referring to. it could have been any of them."
LeeSharpeNFL,"the r^2 between  expected points added  models is going to be very high. either is more predictive than any/a.

chase likely has a good reason for using any/a instead (comparing across eras when n overtime enough data exists to determine  expected points added ) but  expected points added  models are going to be better at measuring efficiency."

DannyParkins,daily fantasy sports  regret it i can take it. the people mad clearly weren't even listening. white sox window is wide open. my only thing with them is they're so young it'll be tough to project what they'll do. some sox fans think i hate them bc of a sign prank. which oh well take a joke.
DannyParkins,yea man  it is  free radio. the trade off is commercials. i get that  it is  a l overtime but  it is  how we make money and what keeps it free entertainment for you. if  it is  too much you can listen to the podc assit that posts a free throw er every show. i feel ya.
Gingfacekillah,adam these personal attacks are getting sad. i wrote a book to help bettors. i le free throw   years old you are discord channel because i dont like the way you talk to people. sorry if either of those things hurt  years old you are feelings but try n overtime to engage in libel. youre embarrassing yourself.
Gingfacekillah,i just liked the program honestly. it seemed like the most comprehensive and you're able to do it at  years old you are own pace which is important for me as there are times in the year i have to focus on studying for law school.  ultimately chose jcu so i could learn both r and python.
logan_matthews9,my first suggestion would be to hit lines early. you are losing a l overtime of value by waiting until the day of. secondly the way you win long term is by getting better odds than available at tip off. i know youve been tracking that - it will be a better indicator than one bad week
PikachuBets,annual circlejerk of equal pay for womens sports again. beyond the gross ignorance of sports finances by ppl who dont know shit they also dont get the best way to help out: by spending  years old you are money on womens sports! cant pay $ without $. put  years old money where  years old mouth is idiots
PikachuBets,i see we have moved from substance to full ad hominems. no biggie. we heard each other already and i  daily fantasy sports  have any beef with you. i'll leave you with this tho what does it say about my transparency that you found my losing streak so easily? how many twitter guys do that? good day
PikachuBets,its n overtime unique.  best of luck posts $250/$500 openers for every major market before any other book opens. the lines are so free throw . they have no influence over wa lines. the fact that you dont know this about the markets is very alarming. if you sell plays you need to learn basics like this.
adamchernoff,if you listened to the show with    on friday and bet a free throw er you'd be 3-2 (lar pk cle -7 and bal -5.5 with sf no 1h u22 and bal buf o43.5). personally i took cle at a worse number earlier in the week so i will grade my friday appearance as a 2-3 loser.
adamchernoff,i learned a simple way to calculate a baseline for nfl totals during my first bookmaking job almost a decade ago. i still use it today to sp overtime numbers on the board at open which may be too low or too high. i thought i would explain today in a thread below to offer some value.
adamchernoff,team that is currently viewed as a -4 but can play up to a -8 but now lower than a -3. at that point i can begin to evaluate the current market and sp overtime opportunities based on the specific matchup for that week. for me it is always important to look at a game multiple ways.
adamchernoff,i didnt delete it i just muted  years old you are tweets so i dont have to see them. had saints -2.5 in my large teaser of the week which covered in addition to -8 for half of the stake. thanks for taking the time to listen. good luck next season with  years old you are team.
Ccon8181,to be fair ive deserved every bit of criticism. its been a bad run for the p assit month. if i was getting butt hurt from some randoms busting balls on twitter then wh against the spread the point of being on twitter. losing real money hurts having ppl on twitter shit talk n overtime so much
Ccon8181,i am n overtime uncertain #niners wire to wire. end the week how we started it with profit. mix in some winners over the weekend and what do you have? the cream rising to the top.. all for free. but keep betting on advice some bozo with no skin in the game gives out haha. all good
Ccon8181,ben i believe the browns were favored more than that. i have the browns favored in 3 games l assit year and 1 the year before. ik because they opened as favs verse jets the p assit two years and i had them each time (however ended a dog verse jets in 2017). still point well made.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  bother s expected points added rating home draw and away.  it is  entirely conceivable that bookmakers deal with draws differently. i'm under no illusion that the methods i've used to remove the margin are n overtime the ones they use. have a look at the record and see how the draws have done.
JambosPicks,the beautiful part of this is we post all o you are records. good and bad. if you care about the 17 week package that record is on o you are site.  if others care about o you are history that record is on the site as well.  that is what being fully transparent is all about.

mschwimer,"man you must think we are the greatest cappers of all time if from the beginning lines will jump like crazy. thank you!

 for what  it is  worth  i agree.  this business model is n overtime sustainable.  the market will catch up when we cant beat the close we will shut it down.  very small window here."
RufusPeabody,fun thought exercise. worth noting that kyle allen was the #1 ranked qb out of hs in 2014 which says he has more potential and upside than his dra free throw  position (undra free throw ed) would indicate. how much stock do you put in dra free throw  position (college play) this  years play  hs recruiting
RufusPeabody,will do a full recap of my attem point  to bet some nfl futures in new jersey.  it is  my first time betting in nj (n overtime counting the dk contest). biggest frustration so far is the apps freezing all the freaking time. and i've been surprised (in both good and bad ways) with the limits.
RufusPeabody,the existence of a subset of bettors who perform at a level worse than 45 percent  (on bets where no-vig implied probability is 50 percent ) in no way implies that there are bettors that are so bad that fading them would be profitable. there will be bettors who hit 45 percent  over a large sample...
SportsCheetah,haha its going to be hard for him to be super accurate with everything th against the spread covered when there is discussion in games that arent actual bets. ville is another i said ramsey news must have broken because its moving and -7 would be a small bet now etc. but counts as full l.
SportsCheetah,den u53.5 -110 - only because my projection is 53 + jokic just played the most basketball of his life this p assit year (80 in reg season + playoff run + fiba). his kid picture looks like me growing up. mpj is a big wild card either way. west g overtime better in general. toss-up.
capjack2000,"my point was they flashed up 6.5 and 50.5. being someone who recognizes value i said ""oh i have to check this out.""

-6.5 -129 is equal to -7.0 -116 n overtime a very attractive value. i  daily fantasy sports  mind shops that manipulate vig i just had an issue with the clickbait. show the vig."
capjack2000,n overtime sure  years old you are point billy. i never said these were derivatives. theres no underlying straight wager these are based on. however there are a l overtime of books that put up hundreds of derivatives and act like they were only meant to lure you in so youd bet a higher margin product.
dinkinc,you forget that you are an elite handicapper.i sit with paul and duke for a short period of time every summer and i leave knowing i can never be as talented as that and happily go back to sports.. but i do like to handicap and limit my losses to $196 by playing a live tournament
robpizzola,years old you are students must be ecstatic that they're paying to get an education from someone who wouldn't bet a +10000 underdog if he had their win probability at 49.9 percent . at le assit you have a job though; at this rate you can work yourself out of that gambling debt in 69 years.
VegasRefund,see all this win totals intrigue and i will never get it.. why lay juice for it to just sit there for months? 16 games of unpredictable factors.. when the profit is the same as any single game bet. zero interest unless theres some crazy edge or it has a plus sign in front of it

the best run game (#rams) on runs:

5.8 ypa
64 percent  success

draw  years old you are own conclusion."
suuma810,cards are a mess. they  daily fantasy sports  have the roster to compete and a defensive-minded hc who wants to run the ball behind a bad ol. we all knew that back in may. steve keim just needs to admit that he was wrong and plug in an offensive-minded head coach to help josh rosen long-term.
suuma810,my reasoning in a nutshell: sea were 9-7 l assit year with 2 gms vs hoyer  beathard. lost several key starters who are tough to replace in one off-season. super low on schotty. et holding out  wright missing time. rams are the superior team sf have a qb.  daily fantasy sports  see them at 9-7 again
ClevTA,hes 34  years old starting pitcher who in his l assit 24 starts has an era of 4.3. goes all the way back into june of his cy young season. his velocity is down and  ho you are rate is way up. n overtime sure i would make the case hes one of their best players
ClevTA,i know it sounds silly to us but  for what  it is  worth  the stock volume was double yesterday than avg and nobody knows for sure yet if the ad will actually effect sales. id like to think (have been taught my whole life) the mkt is efficient  any dip in price would be corrected immediately
ClevTA,colts outgain tennessee 5.8 to 5.0 yds/play with their top 3 wrs out and mack out at rb. indy has one missed  field goal  and 2 others blocked with one returned for a  touchdown  on the go ahead   field goal  to potentially win the gm. but all of the sudden the titans are sleeper contenders lol
ClevTA,3 days later and i still am pissed i didnt take jets +2.5 vs skins. everything told me to take the jets and the matchup was ideal. but the line somehow went from  -1 to -2.5. it baffled me  that ke point  me off of it. i want to know who and why hammered the skins
CizzlingSports,"this is 100 percent  a lie.  g overtime worked in  college football  in 2017-18 g overtime worked in 2018-2019  will likely get worked again in 2019-20.

spanky,the truth struck his nerve backed him into a corner and he had nothing else to come back with but call me a rat.  he threatened to show discovery and i dared him to show it which of course he couldnt cuz it doesnt exist. he is a nobody in the business - just another tout.
spanky,a common misconce point ion is sharps get kicked out for winning.  ive been kicked out of joints a free throw er going 0-6.  why? cuz i beat the closing line on all 6 plays.  winning is a byproduct of beating the closing line.  forget the win loss record. show me a detailed closing line record
spanky,g overtime a chance to meet kristian nylen ceo of kambi. real nice guy. i relayed my concerns about being limited to 10 bucks on nfl sunday and being kicked out of dra free throw kings.  he listen and we exchanged business cards. hopefully things can get better n overtime just for me but for everyone.
spanky,when i bet mayweather to beat mcgregor i wasnt happy that i won. i was happy that i didnt lose.  most bettors have limited bankroll and could go broke. no average joe should bet 7 times their normal unit to win 1 unit but instead bet their normal 1 unit to win 1/7th of a unit.
aluckyaday,agree. but loss of closing line value will indicate to the modeler that has happened. closing line value tells them quicker than any results would inform them. the issue for a capper without closing line value is it takes hundreds if n overtime thousands of results to be sure they are n overtime just getting lucky.
aluckyaday,there may be a large error but it does n overtime mean the predictions are useless. a 400/1 sh overtime won a stage in the vuelta today another 400/1 sh overtime (annoyingly i was on that one) finished 3rd. but bookmaker predictions on cycling are n overtime useless just hard with a l overtime of variance!
aluckyaday,in reality they would n overtime be putting him in no. 10. i would think the national unity government would just be put in place to ask the eu for an extension to allow for a general election. a free throw er which the temporary pm would stand down to allow the election to take place.
aluckyaday,maybe but maybe the line movement is because the tipster is finding value. you are assuming is the line would n overtime move if the tipster did n overtime put the bet up. you can n overtime prove that but you can prove that the closing lines are on average the most efficient whatever the cause.

EdMillerPoker,"been a few of these in the gambling world lately but really every two-bit gri free throw er in this world falls back on ""debate me"" when someone tries to call them on their bullshit and i want to point out what an illegitimate demand that is.

EdMillerPoker,ha. congrats. the moment i finalize the dra free throw  of the manuscri point  is the second-best moment for me. the moment a free throw er that when i realize i now have six weeks of shit work ahead of me before publishing is the worst. hitting that publish button on amazon tho is pure joy.
LeeSharpeNFL,"related to this i really like this look at qbs from  with respect to qb types. he does a 3-axis look at qbs by int/db sacks/db y/a.

qbs can be great if either of the first two are bad. but if  years old you are y/a is low  it is  hard to make up for that."
LeeSharpeNFL,"no flex. dal/phi was almost certainly protected by fox. n overtime a ton of great games but if i were them i probably flex to no/ten as it has playoff implications for both.

but chi is a huge media market they want prime time games in it if the bears are even ok because of ratings."
LeeSharpeNFL,this is fair. if we have enough data from the p assit to calculate more advanced metrics like  expected points added  i think we should use it but if we're just looking at box scores trying to make a better any/a that can be derived from that to help contextualize that era makes sense to me.
LeeSharpeNFL,for incompletions you can always think of it as air_ expected points added  imagines they caught it where tackled and yac_ expected points added  imagines a free throw er catching it the receiver g overtime confused and ran the wrong where where he was tackled at the line of scrimmage by an angry offensive lineman :p
whale_capper,fo you are years ago you could blindly plug i pace and it improved  years old you are total projections relative to the market by about 20 percent  (which is huge) nowadays  it is  somewhat built into the opening totals and when  it is  n overtime the market corrects the total before limits go up generally

JoeyKnish22,dont think hes a p5 qb tbh or a lower tier p5. more of a g5 player. pretty small (under 6  free throw ) and n overtime an incredible athlete (good n overtime great). for instance think eric barriere is a much better player. think hes a little over hyped cause of the l assit name.
JoeyKnish22,its n overtime nearly as key as 10. i should clarify in a normal tease i would never pay an extra 10c to get 11 over 10.5. this was more of a yolo tease and it coupled with getting 11 and getting a couple games down to pk instead of -1 and -1 instead of -1.5.
LockyLockerson,"pretty interesting 1p action in tb-bos.  in very small sample both teams scoring and allowing high  percent  of their goals in the first.  hence a 1p total  that is  juiced out of whack with ""standard."" if you see total is 6-6.1 and think 1p is going to just be 30 percent  of that you'd bet under"
DannyParkins,i think hes a 3/4 starter at this point in the al with clear upside. ill be interested to know the details on what itll take to vest to a 4 year deal. i think his value is gonna be huge on the intangible side for the young starters and youll begin hearing those stories early.
DannyParkins,man tony romo really has a chance to make a cut in a pga to you are event. still -2 through 23 holes. bogeyed two of first 3 today and goes birdie-birdie to get back on the right side of the projected -1 cut line. if he makes the cut boomer esiason calls bears/vikings with nantz.
DannyParkins,or ya know you can take a joke? if you honestly think a tweet about a 2nd inning at bat means the team is back in the big picture is my true feelings than you might take this whole sports thing a bit too seriously. just having fun watching a game with a beer my man.

Gingfacekillah,yeah i agree. i  daily fantasy sports  find a ton of games with value in an nfl season but usually post a cash positive season. l assit season was 14-6 for me in nfl. i've been focusing on nba and mlb to try and get as many games as possible. both leagues are very efficiently priced.
Gingfacekillah,basketball season is coming to a close for me. i  daily fantasy sports  bet playoff games and garbage time/ wonky lineup changes are starting to make these l assit handful of games a losing proposition. 3 straight months of nba profits though its been a good run this year. shi free throw ing to mlb soon.

adamchernoff,well i am n overtime associating with or endorsing anything? i g overtime a call from fox sports yesterday to go on a national show to talk nfl. i went on for 15 minutes and presented my best stuff for sunday. my hope is that it sounded better than the usual content and listeners enjoyed it.
adamchernoff,people mistake isolation for solitude. solitude is slots (different topic). isolation is the connection between you and  years old you are bet. what do you hear what do you see? because the tv's are all in the same sp overtime and elevated you can sit and n overtime move for hours and hear the main game.
adamchernoff,only issue i see is that the eagles are in the nfc east. in order for an nfc team to win the super bowl they must beat the afc champion and the jets are in the afc. so it would be difficult to bet on an nfc side considering the upside the jets present at 2500/1.
adamchernoff,what i am saying i have an issue with is using john harbaugh's 67 percent  against the spread  record which includes data from cam cameron calling plays for troy smith in 09 as why baltimore has a better chance to cover vs jacksonville next week - which strangely o free throw en dictates the preseason market.

TheCousinSal,well i dont listen to you ever but would still like to know how backing a guy 3rd in scoring 4th in rebounding a dpoy contender and does it all playing 5 fewer minutes per game on a team that has the best record in the league is a dumb take. maybe you should start watching.

mschwimer,gotcha!  if o you are model says a football team should be -2.5 (+100) and the market line is a pickem (+100) we believe the actual edge percentage is 6.2 percent .  if the game closes at -1.5 then o you are edge over the closing line becomes 2.8 percent . that what you are asking?
mschwimer,so does that mean you dont we will beat the market? if so you are the #1 person that should sign up. put  years old you are money where  years old you are mouth is. if you are right you get 10k if n overtime you lose 3k. dont play any of o you are recs.
mschwimer,to drastically over simplify. mlb owners are faced with the decision. do i make $200m in profit and have x percent  chance to win ws or do i make a $150m profit and have 2x percent  chance to win the ws. recently most owners have been choosing o point ion 1. fans should hold owners accountable.
RufusPeabody,because you are paying more in extra vig than its worth. 48 for example is ~3.3 percent  push rate meaning buying onto 48 3.3 percent  of the time you turn a loss into a push. so instead of .5238 (-110) you now have .5238/(1-.033)=.5416 (-118). this case buying on 48 from -110 is worth 8c.
RufusPeabody,im n overtime asking you to change an industry. im asking you to display actual records rather than cherry picked *h overtime streaks* you get by dividing  years old you are plays up into all these different categories so when you filter by play type unit and day of the week something is always hot.
RufusPeabody,of course there are. but also know that my dms are flooded with messages from touts and guess what? they all claim to be the 1 percent  that are an exce point ion to the rule. for  years old you are average bettor trying to find those true exce point ions is a fools errand.
SportsCheetah,told the guys this could be a positive thing. but these seem like clear errors (uva 1h ou buy point bet that never exited jets game i said i didnt bet etc) and none of us are going to want to have to babysit every pick from every person every day as you update. gl.
SportsCheetah,"the side i would bet if i had to take a position in every week 4 game on the current board:

iowa st -17.5
ohio st -38.5
charlotte +42

SportsCheetah,i haven't bothered to go back and check but i wonder how o free throw en a team has had to pr expected points added re for the air raid in one week and then turn around and pr expected points added re for the o point ion the next (and then how they fared).
capjack2000,"looks like a decent promo at first glance. you get 5 percent  back up to $100 each nfl gameday in playoffs. the 5 percent  issued as free bet on the super bowl. 

wager $2k on saturday nfl action get $100. 

they count pro bowl though wagering $2k on the pro bowl?!? 

all nfl wagers qualify."
capjack2000,i get it. youre incentivized to talk nice about them. it enables you to put out good content about sports (which you do). i just hate to see an independent site whos n overtime afraid to speak truth to power take an overtly shill approach and talk up an advertiser in a story like that
capjack2000,"i think the us market is all just a high stakes gold rush. 80 percent  of the operators are in this just to get acquired by a bigger company. 

the sad fact is being an operator is nearly impossible to profit at without economy of scale. there are only 4 or 5 of those worldwide."
capjack2000,"the app may look like it was designed by children but it is n overtime used by children. 

im guessing the integration will be like thescore where there is a little bet icon next to each game that links to the betting site. you still need to pass age and geo verification to get in."
capjack2000,"picking at le assit 3 of 5 coin-flips correctly is actually 50 percent  probability. 

probably too much math for a saturday night but there are 32 permutations of 5 coin-flips. 16 of them result in one side coming up at le assit 3 of 5 times. betting against him would be 50 percent  too. +100/+100"
capjack2000,"i'm sure dk will pass around a hat if letting me bet $500 on an nfl game will bankru point  the company....the company that currently has a $1.5 billion valuation. 

if the hat isn't enough they're screwed. that online casino they run and the  daily fantasy sports  with 11 percent  rake won't pay the bills."
dinkinc,too much confidance is much worse than lack of it... i have seen far too many good gamblers go broke n overtime appreciating how hard this game is..i am lucky to have learned things from the best but i know i can only be a recreational horse player and serious sports bettor at this time
RASPicks,i'm on record stating that what we release is less than 10 percent  of o you are total volume in a year which includes other play types/markets that we  daily fantasy sports  offer a service in. my point of contention is the notion that o you are unreleased stuff is better. that would be something.
ClevTA,minnesota (stefanski) has utilized playaction at the 3rd highest percentage of total drop backs in the nfl. baker was terrible this year but was really good using pa. his comp percent  diff btw pa  non pa was highest in the nfl at 10 percent   a yds/att diff th against the spread 3rd highest. great fit
ClevTA,been reported by multiple reporters over the l assit few years so th against the spread never been disputed. even when they interviewed those guys at the time it came out who he recommended. sd thing isnt great but if haslam doesnt bother to listen to him or give him power i dont blame him
ClevTA,man l assit summer when i said teams were nuts for n overtime signing teddy i g overtime a l overtime of backlash. i begged the browns to just sign teddy for peanuts rather than trade a 3rd for tyrod  pay him big $. he keeps proving himself. he's perfect for chicago with that d
ClevTA,a bad ol trying to run up the middle in heavy formation is a horrible idea at all times. all u have to do is throw a 3 yard pass to  years old you are rb instead if th against the spread all u want. but  years old you are way really works out well
ClevTA,look at the hou sked.funny thing is where the texans are going to struggle this  year is defending great offenses in the nfc south + ne  lac n overtime protecting the qb. so they trade a good pass rusher for a lt. its backwards. deshaun is responsible for many of the sacks he takes anyway
spanky,"bout 10 years ago a big russian group i was friendly with bet big money. they had really sharp c against the spread on their crew. they asked me to come to their posh nyc office to teach their guys how to use donbest and analyze lines!?!

handicapping and betting are two very different skills!"
spanky,"sheep just called me.  he told me hes out of the business and is no longer associated with you. he told me everything about you. who you deal with and how you get  years old you are info. 

youre a professional bullshitter who claims to know people that you dont know.  youre a scam tout."
spanky,so we started betting on  l assit week....  we tried to get a dime on the lions about 1 ho you are before game time on sunday and they gave us $10! this is an nfl side! we tried to bet miami ohio earlier today and they gave us $5!  sports betting in america 2018
aluckyaday,i was going to ask you what  years old you are sim shows but thought as its a paid service now i better not. my recency bias saying leicester are better than they are given credit for and man city worse. have  years old you are ratings for those 2 changed much over the season?
aluckyaday,when will the government learn a paradox is something that can't be solved. the red lines of no irish border no customs union and maintaining the union is a paradox. you can have any 2 but n overtime all 3. pretty simple really. the uk must decide which one goes. if it can't no brexit
aluckyaday,bookies annoy me a lot! but i do think they are o free throw en fairer than most give them credit for. the real question is n overtime really this case but what happens to the unknown winning singles that never get collected? as rufus put it the rule does create a freeroll for them.
aluckyaday,but you are n overtime looking at the probability of the single you are looking at the probability of the related double. if he wins the man of steel then the probability of salford being in the top 5 would be quick guess about 1/10. so the odds of the double should be only 28/1!!!
aluckyaday,n overtime if you want to push people off nfl sides where the margin is small on to props where the margin is much bigger. what is the hold on nfl sides? does that cover the acquisition cost? a 2 percent  losing better is n overtime profitable for a marketing intensive so free throw  book.
aluckyaday,yep. but it is the job of the business to minimise the chance of that happening. having a palp rule does that. yes that rule can be abused and o free throw en is. but it would n overtime be in the regulators interests to ban them. the more casinos make the more tax revenue.
aluckyaday,"personally i think the press are reading far too much in to it. they are a team doing a job. cycling is all about sacrificing yourself for the good of the team. quintana understands that fully he is n overtime been ""sha free throw ed"" at all. has he said he is being treated unfairly?"
aluckyaday,n overtime sure how true it is but i have heard of traders restricting punters with small percentage losses because of the effect on their bonus targets. if you need a 7 percent  hold to get  years old you are bonus punters with a 2 percent  hold are n overtime going to get it done!
aluckyaday,to me personally it makes no difference if the uk leaves or remains. i'm a legal eu resident and will still have the privileges that brings. so its n overtime really a case of me acce point ing it. i will think it is a bad idea for the to leave until hindsight proves otherwise
aluckyaday,according to the st against the spread portugal's economy is booming. no its not! its chugging along at the same rate as its always done. its just the government's initiatives (like you get entered in to a lottery every time you ask for a recei point !) to get more of it declared are working
EdMillerPoker,"it wont tho. there are fewer than 100 games per week the ball is dead 80 percent  of the time and the game has an extremely predictable cadence.

n overtime saying there wont be edge cases but the idea that someone is gonna beat you all over the place courtisiding football is n overtime real."
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  want to go back and forth too much about it but yes i know books o free throw en  daily fantasy sports  think of it that way and also from time to time they get kicked in the teeth on parlays as a result of n overtime looking at it this way
GolcondaFund,"you  daily fantasy sports  say?...
just n overtime sure what was ever #sharp about an avg qb without top 2 wrs..laying  touchdown .. the thing about being #sharp is being able to point out likely future outcome n overtime rely on p assit performance to handicap. but you do you take the chalk and prosper."
GolcondaFund,"2/3underdogs  moneyline this a free throw ernoon.
if betting unit on ea  moneyline up 5+ units on going 2/3
now that my friends is sharp  raiders browns skins
raiders -3.5  also took at +350
skins pre-season i said this team would quit by wk 5 then play 2 wks in a row trust macro handicap"
GolcondaFund,"to be fair to #colts fans booing they were sucker punched by the timing of the news of his retirement.

nonrandomalpha,"it wasn't pretty but bucs +7 was the right side all night .  thursday night football  can be a dumpster fire but i like what i saw from the bucs d...have shown flashes two weeks in a row now. cam doesn't look right; every decent throw is followed by at le assit 2 duds...

#tbvscar"
nonrandomalpha,miamis self sabotage so early in the season seems unprecedented and n overtime sure if this team has pride or not. either way you will look pretty damn silly if you lose taking p against the spread -21 or dolphins +21 so will likely pass as well...but still expect number to creep higher til kickoff
LeeSharpeNFL,"ok of my 50k sims prior to week 12 there were ~10k where seahawks won today and then went on to get a bye.

of those 10k simulations 47 percent  had the packers winning tonight and 53 percent  had the 49ers winning tonight. so maybe this game doesn't actually matter to seattle all that much."
LeeSharpeNFL,if scoring on the l assit 2 drives made some qbs more confident but n overtime others -- and the increased confidence led those qbs to play better -- we could see it in the data that recent scoring creates better play sometimes. we  daily fantasy sports  have to seperate the groups. math is powerful!
AndyMSFW,p against the spread have bengals bills dolphins le free throw .  should be able to still have the #2 seed despite having pretty much zero tiebreakers.  i  daily fantasy sports  think he'd throw away the #1 seed to scout but i also think he's likely as surprised as us at how good baltimore is.
TheKostos,has anyone ever seen stat corrections with yahoo? i'd prefer n overtime to risk a potential loss given that i've won the matchup and  daily fantasy sports  need to play either guy but also would want to set the world on fire if there was a stat correction and i lost by half a point
TheKostos,im someone who makes a living talking about sports and i dont understand why people are so appalled by things being postponed and canceled. who gives a shit about it in the grand scheme. get this virus under control at all costs. th against the spread wh against the spread important n overtime a tournament
LockyLockerson,"back from an 8-day road trip down the e assit co assit with the kids and the 3 trending stories on my twitter are the tony awards big papi sh overtime in the leg at a dominican club and a new season of ""claws"" one of the worst shows on tv.

great to be back!"
DannyParkins,ok grownup... clays tweets referenced are n overtime from a single day or even single month. he disregarded that adidas  reebok were also down the day a free throw er kap signing because of a tariff but only pointed out nike and kap. so he claimed victory on kap hurting nike stock with no evidence.
DannyParkins,guys dont blame nagy for throwing the ball on 2nd and goal from the 3. th against the spread an easy touchdown if mitch doesnt throw a fade route that didnt even reach the damn goalline. hes trying to build his qb up and pad his stats. th against the spread 100 percent  on trubisky.
DannyParkins,didnt mute you. mccarthy had a hof qb and didnt evolve and keep up with the changes to the game around him which if youve read the redem point ion pieces he admitted with the work hes done while hes away. so n overtime sure what gotchya moment you think youve pinned me in here.
Gingfacekillah,these were all the available o point ions for me when publishing. n overtime quite sure why but canada and australia weren't available to me. i would suggest ordering it from the closest amazon site to you. i'll see if i can contact amazon to find out if its possible to include ca and au.
Gingfacekillah,i agree with much of what rob said. especially his tips on getting started. low limits and off markets are what you want to focus on. too many get torched by starting in a highly efficient liquid market. give  years old you are skills a chance to catch up to the competition before firing hard.
logan_matthews9,"fun thought exercise: with just the national championship le free throw  im tied for 17th with fo you are others in the #knishinvitational. i think my outcomes are probably down to this:

get both right end up around tied for 10th
go 1-1 cash in the top 20
miss both fall out of the money"
logan_matthews9,interesting day for dj. started very strong (-3 thru 5) then was a roller coaster with 2 ob tee shots. is the injury still playing a part? or just some unevenness from a lack of competitive play? hes those two shots away from being tied for second so n overtime sure id fade him yet
logan_matthews9,i think the most telling thing about this interview is how o free throw en he says something along the lines of how hes always learning and trying to get better. it is such a change from jk and arena who seemed to think they had all the answers  looked externally when things went wrong
PikachuBets,but go on keep selling the dream and making people believe that paying you to enter their shitty ass picks into a guaranteed monies contest is worth their money and time. also keep showing off dat wad of cash on tv in  years old you are car! keep buying hooks keep hanging with lv touts
PikachuBets,hi denny big fan. great research you here. did you also look at what color jerseys bos wore in those games? what about game attendance numbers? could be something there you  daily fantasy sports  wanna miss those angles. i heard that celtics are also like 8-2-3 against the spread  when  it is  sunny in milwaukee?
adamchernoff,pardon the hijacking of post. when you li free throw ed  years old you are ham off of the grill on thanksgiving what adjective would you use to describe the texture of it? im hours in and have a jello-ish boob like he free throw . trying to decide on when to drop the glaze...
adamchernoff,there is no speed there is no isolation and there is no continuity. people do n overtime know what they are betting on they do n overtime know what the odds are everyone is looking in a different direction there is no sound and there is everything but an ease of process to bet (cont...)
adamchernoff,"isabella  touchdown  if we were to parse that play from the 50 arizona ran the box score reads:

sf - arz

ypp: 6.0 - 5.4
ypa: 8.2 - 5.0
ypr: 3.3 - 6.7

all of the sudden the game looks completely different. some folks may point out the ypr advantage but it is..."
adamchernoff,hey kenny how do you go about accounting for success against so free throw  zone with a negative game state if at all? for example minshew gained 154 of his 275 on drives in the 4th when kc was ahead 24  21  averaged just 4.9 intended yards per throw. do you discount that vs neutral?
adamchernoff,that is a good point. perhaps a better way to express it would be from a win total relationship standpoint the adjustment is ~23 percent  and so far the two point spread adjustments show 21.5 percent  (3 to 7.5) and 24 percent  (3 to 9)? would fall in line with the management/clients at both books.
adamchernoff,down to two or three spots. but i was tired of wasting all of the effort on the other 13-14 games i did n overtime bet. handicapping into buckets was a method i started to use so i could understand *who* was betting on *what* each week and *why*. by knowing those three i could...
adamchernoff,all brokerage tools like that work on turnover rates with bookmakers. increased turnover is never a bad thing. the issue with using those from a player side is that bets are n overtime guaranteed. there is o free throw en a delay in the call between the third party and the bookmakers as bets do

RufusPeabody,with alabama we really  daily fantasy sports  know how the committee will treat tua's injury. a convincing win over auburn would go a long way but that would be auburn's 4th loss which could diminish the value of the win to the committee. a win by alabama would give them a 46 percent  chance.

ClevTA,nonsense lol. but using a sample size of 3rd downs in 1.5 qs  just assuming a punt inside 5 is perfectly reasonable. g overtime it. they converted 4th downs in the 2nd half on a 23 yd  touchdown  in 4th. keep thinking punting wins gms. ask harbaugh  the ravens how aggressiveness has paid off
ClevTA,everyone scratching their heads as to why the packers are only -6. just as an fyi since week 7 the packers defense ranks dead l assit in success rate defending the pass and 31st defending the run. the distance from them to the 31st ranked pass d is as wide as 31st to 23rd

aluckyaday,its so much harder. the us books have been protected until now. recreational money will be hard to get. the problem with sharp bookmaking is its global winner takes all.  years old you are real competitors in that market are n overtime sharps but pinney. fine if you can beat their models and traders.
aluckyaday,but in reality it does n overtime work like that. people have dreams of playing in the nfl. they have no chance of getting there and they know that. they play the game because they enjoy it. same with sports betting. so free throw  books cater to their needs. sharp books cater for pros.
aluckyaday,"its n overtime what my sims show but i'm making assum point ions about how people are using them. ""random"" lucky bets can be + expected value but only under certain criteria. it would depend on how the bets are distributed across that criteria. people are probably smarter than i'm giving them credit for"
aluckyaday,"i would n overtime say i was sharp. i can beat a recreational book which is a different thing entirely. recreational books are n overtime ""scared"" to take a bet as a l overtime of people assume. they are n overtime trying to beat sharps. they are trying to maximize profit from recreational bettors."
aluckyaday,missed a l overtime of the chat n overtime really my kind of bet. find the conce point  interesting though but if something sounds too good to be true.... the guarantee is based on bookmaker odds. can you actually get them? if they are successful i would think slippage would become a big problem.
aluckyaday,they could show more but n overtime sure it would have that much effect on problem gamblers. it is n overtime the quantity of the win or loss that drives them but a need for dopamine. actually showing losses may make things worse due to loss aversion and the compulsion to win it back.
aluckyaday,i posted a link to an article in my reply. it basically highlights what went wrong with the betfair exchange in europe and why exchanges are n overtime the holy grail some make them out to be. its a long read but worth it if you really want to understand the problems exchanges face.
aluckyaday,rather than mbl a better idea would be to get the gc to make books issue figures for the number of punters they restrict in a similar way to self exclusions. that would put pressure on them n overtime to do it so willy nilly. some books are a l overtime worse than others!

joeytunes2,bookies use so free throw ware and auto movers. (computer programs) also known as a bot. get me a bookmaker that moves his own lines. and i wont use my bots. a old fashion duel. no one works harder then me. i will beat you one way or another.  it is  just the facts.
EdMillerPoker,"we're building each product and working out the kinks before we move on to the next one. so far so good. the response in se point ember to the launch of o you are nfl and  college football  products was absolutely overwhelming.

within a couple weeks people were widely scraping us and moving markets."
EdMillerPoker,"seen the topic of in-play scalping come up a l overtime lately. just wanted to deliver a warning.

 it is  entirely possible if you see a +130/-110 scalp in-play that  it is  n overtime + expected value to bet either side.  that is  due to execution risk.

operators protect their in-play using delay/reject tactics"
EdMillerPoker,"launching  this football season has been one of the most fun things i've done in my life. a free throw er fo you are years of working on it in private we get to show it to the world. and each week i get more people messaging me saying ""holy crap this is amazing!"""
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  my opinion is that this league data requirement is silly. if the leagues produce a high quality feed at a reasonable price it will absolutely sell itself. the only reason they would need a requirement is if they intend to either provide poor quality or ask a ridiculous price
nonrandomalpha,dominant? u have week 1 bears syndrome. why cant we just be honest with ourselves + recognize the team is incredibly young going to go thru extreme growing pains + going to lose 50+ games + n overtime even flirt with the playoffs. this is part of the plan. dont have 2b delusional tho.
LeeSharpeNFL,"no nfl team went from worst in the division in 2018 to first in 2019. none of them even made the playoffs in 2019 (unless the raiders scenario pulls through). 

no team went from first to worst either. in the afc the division winners are in fact the exact same fo you are teams."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is an interesting thought.

if gb be against the spread det and no be against the spread car earlier in the day than sea cann overtime get a bye.

but they then can rest starters vs. sf and lose on purpose they can go to philly instead of hosting vikings. 

which is better?"
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah the kelly value is around a third of the bankroll. but these are raw model numbers without any kind of market regression. also you're replying to why i think  it is  an outlier. no shame in recognizing a potential weakness of  years old you are model. i'm a hobbyist n overtime a professional.
LeeSharpeNFL,"2) i've added a new column ""special"" which is a 1 if  it is  a special teams play or 0 if not.

this will report 0 for special teams plays with penalties currently marked as ""no_play"" i consider this a bug with a potential future fix but still a net improvement to the code."
LeeSharpeNFL,"q: why does every site have to list the sunday early window games in a different order? can't we all agree an on order?

a: apparently no. a free throw er all  lists the games in **reverse id** order so i  daily fantasy sports  know i would expect anyone else to follow their ids."
LeeSharpeNFL,"packers fans shouldn't fret too much.

of 50k simulations i ran prior to week 12 there were ~11k with the nfc-playoff-relevant games went as they did today (sea no and sf all winning). among those gb's chances to:

make playoffs: 95 percent 
win division: 61 percent 
get bye: 20 percent 
#1 seed: 2 percent"
LeeSharpeNFL,"my wp chart scri point  errors sometimes so currently automation is disabled. 

i'm working late so called my partner and talked them through how to find rstudio find the right scri point  run it and read output to me.

they're n overtime a math or code person but g overtime there. i was impressed!"
JoeyKnish22,n overtime trying to be a prick here but for a couple guys that pride themselves on accuracy you mention fields for heisman and allude to him being the front runner (n overtime remotely the case). just if ppl are taking this  podcast info as actionable it was n overtime the most nuanced discussion.
JoeyKnish22,for what  it is  worth  im fine paying for sub content th against the spread useable. i love espn+ and would give the sales person a handjob along with the $4.99 a month cause its such a great price for what you get and i use it a ton. but wasnt getting that here.
JoeyKnish22,im n overtime sure how f assit it all gels they did lose a couple premium players. but i straight up still think theyre a better team with a better manager than real. would need some serious barca regression and all the new guys fit well but just think that price is way high.
LockyLockerson,i'd argue the opposite although n overtime fervently.  i think it maybe has gone too far but they are probably the team i'm le assit confident in having a good rating on right now of any nba team.  but i find it unlikely the pels are this much better especially if holiday doesn't play
LockyLockerson,episode 4 of l assit chance u really incredible this season.  a coach yells at his players for n overtime tucking their shirts in and preaches doing things the right way then goes on the biggest shit talking spree ive ever seen when he wins.  its incredible hypocrisy th against the spread great tv.
DannyParkins,as someone in the industry i have no idea what you get out of tweeting this every week feel free to just n overtime listen. you know this industry is subjective. you like scott and  daily fantasy sports  like me.  that is  cool. it happens. change the station no need to be a dick.
DannyParkins,remember a free throw er the 17 dra free throw  the qb talk was about talent and situation. mitch went to the worst sp overtime because mahomes had reid  playmakers and watson had an offensive coach  hopkins. now mitch has a new coach and good skill guys while deshaun has a coach playing gm.
DannyParkins,that is  already the case isn't it? high profile schools already have an advantage because they're high profile. so yea kids at kentucky would get more endorsements than murray st but once murray st gets ja morant he'd be able to make whatever he could at murray st. th against the spread the game
Gingfacekillah,"had a great day in chel:

for tomorrow i like:
-  minutes -5.5
- cousins u232.5 pass yds
- cousins u 31.5 pass att

looks like vikings will be able to cover. you can expect another over-the-top dedication to the run game in the l assit quarter if they're up."
logan_matthews9,-7 gd xgd even worse. lucky to make playoffs and were only in the picture because turner had 1 the best gk seasons ever. unlikely to repeat that and lost 106 starts from l assit year. have to be high on buksa camara and sinovic (whos only good with besler) to think theyre better
logan_matthews9,"here's my case for hovland:

- while it was ""only"" 29 recorded rounds l assit year (tiger had 30 for some reference) his tee-to-green ranked third on the pga and strokes gained total was fi free throw h.

- this includes 5 t20's including a t12 at the us open and 4th at wyndham"
logan_matthews9,appreciate this level take. the the us isnt valuing dual nationals takes are bad and without basis. its one of the things us has done really well in the p assit (berhalter getting boyd the latest example). also by my count 23 mex/us duals have a cap for the usmnt 3 for el tri
logan_matthews9,based on what? they didnt make the playoffs traded three of their top five players and added ad. im n overtime saying its n overtime a net gain for them but they are probably the third best team in the west. 3-1 is obnoxious for a title even if they were the best team
PikachuBets,also those picks from february are still n overtime public. nobody knows what you played or claim to played. those  college basketball  wins account for almost 65-70 percent  of  years old you are  college basketball  total profit that youre still advertising as lifetime gains every single week. give me a fucking break about transparency
PikachuBets,"ok. and i'm sure fl ""for years"" was related to nothing named ""tan."" an active decision was made to join a bottom feeder network for undoubtedly large $$$. you  daily fantasy sports  get to do that and ask to distance yourself from the rest of the scum that provides you with a platform. capisce?"
PikachuBets,we showed screenshots of  years old you are tos keeping liability to $500.  years old you are tos makes no mention of the $10k guarantee. all terms of dispute and arbitration are rigged in  years old you are favor. there is no legal recourse for the customer if you dont pay out the $10k.
PikachuBets,"restated  years old you are opinion is ""if stupid people who  daily fantasy sports  know any better get baited by a losing investment decision but are happy with it then who cares about the guy running the fraud?""

yet imagine if nobody spoke up about rip-offs simply bc there are idiots who are happy."
PikachuBets,"4/13 nba lockz #lockball

PikachuBets,ofc gambling media is allowed. free press no shit. what's n overtime allowed is for a media guy to claim massive superiority over ppl whose monthly wagers undoubtedly exceed  years old you are annual salary. that is n overtime allowed. n overtime all of gambling twitter is filled with degen squares. get a clue.
PikachuBets,"""tried to help everyone""

translation: ""at first i couldn't get down so i dmed  asked twitter for outs. but once the rest of the gambling world realized just how big of a whale i am everyone came out of the woodwork to book me so now i ain't need none of y'all $200 accts."""
PikachuBets,"years old you are wifes family is undoubtedly white. guess what black ppl came here as immigrants too generations ago and they also worked super hard in the cotton fields! oh wait...

black ppl have drive all the same. the doors are shut. its n overtime a black and white argument just a caveat"
PikachuBets,its terrible n overtime because i said so but because its n overtime the goal of college basketball. coaches across the board are n overtime telling their players this is how to get to the nba. theyre just coaching and playing college ball. theyre n overtime trying to be at nba level at all.
adamchernoff,they do well in europe and i find the science behind them is fascinating. i g overtime a in-de point h look at the d expected value process ~18 months ago with a big operator when i was developing a sl overtime and etg. their data shows that patrons who play the simulated games...
adamchernoff,"sake of this assume that all of the numbers shown on these reports are 100 percent  accurate. as someone viewing the report you are le free throw  in the dark on many things. 

what is the handle on the game? 
what is the liability on non straight bets? 
which accounts are playing which game?"
adamchernoff,love watching shanahan. goodwin motion around the back looks like nothing but as he came around both lbs took a side step le free throw  to put them a step out of position right at the block to open a hole. every guy moving for sf has an impact. so well thought out. beautiful.
adamchernoff,sorry realize it was a difficult question for sure. i very much utilize both films and st against the spread but i spend a l overtime of time lately thinking about turning something i catch on film into another data point for market pricing. trying to estimate the roi/forec assit error of watching film.
adamchernoff,"n overtime when i price games. it is an easy tell though. look at next week...

coaches that stand out with positive records harbaugh zimmer o'brien

bal -2.5 to -4.5
 minutes +3 to +2.5
hou +3 to +2

coaches with stand out negative records quinn garrett

atl -1.5 to +3
dal +3 to +3.5"
adamchernoff,"0.50 (probability of winning) * $1.10 (amount won per bet) - 0.50 (probability of losing) * $1.00 (amount lost per bet) = $0.05.

that means for every $1 you bet in the coin toss you would expect to win $0.05. you have a 5 percent  edge over the game and therefore can stake accordingly."
adamchernoff,"there is not. for example 

fav: american odds / (american odds + 100) * 100 =  percent 
dog: 100 / (positive american odds + 100) * 100 =  percent 

the best answer in my opinion is use decimal odds. 

1/odds =  percent  

it is tough to change but it makes everything so much easier."
adamchernoff,keeper and de point h in midfield is certainly a concern. if there is a team where age does play a factor it is here with gurrero (35) and farfan (34). all but two players have been on field under gareca. 17 of 23 players from 2018 world cup return. interesting matchup vs venezuela.
adamchernoff,i guess it is that i force myself to think like that as little as possible to avoid emotional bias in my wagers pre or post bet. on a side note i am enjoying  years old you are preview videos on wagertalk. super well produced short meaningful content. hope you guys keep doing them.
Ccon8181,n overtime to mention they were down 3 right before half with ball in  field goal  range going for  touchdown . throws a pick returned to own 25. buccs score  touchdown . so instead of going on to half tied they go in down 10. brutal swing. plus defense made jamis look like brady.

12Xpert,"well perhaps we are arguing over what ""vip"" means. would you agree most of the turnover comes from a much smaller percentage of players? i would ask you to show data but i'd guess you wouldn't have access to that anymore and even if you did would n overtime do so for commercial reasons"
12Xpert,"and nish i think  years old you are answer to  years old you are question is to be found in the article:
""it doesnt matter if we win or n overtime [w]e beat the line in every single bet today. and when you beat the line... th against the spread better than sex.
#winwithwits"
12Xpert,hmm i'm n overtime sure. for future price movements to be random that would imply no bias in the way humans interpret p assit information that has arrived at the market. i.e. once  it is  arrived then  it is  public and fully reflected in the price move. that might n overtime be the case.
12Xpert,"no  it is  n overtime 50/50 as i've explained in my book and articles but evidently you are either too stupid to understand anything that i say or too determined just to troll endlessly on this feed and interpret me as ""betting = exactly coin tossing"" for  years old you are own self gratification."
12Xpert,that is  fair enough in which case this should probably remain a hobby but of course  it is  up to you. i'm simply pointing out what punters need to know or at le assit those punters that have a clue about what they need to know. fortunately for you most  daily fantasy sports .
12Xpert,in  years old you are opinion. and there is always a next time. if you  daily fantasy sports  suffer consequences you learn nothing.  that is  why there'll be another major financial crash because bankers weren't punished at le assit n overtime in the uk. capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses (taleb).
12Xpert,you think working class folk in the valleys who  daily fantasy sports  see the eu money spent there doing anything for them who have voted labo you are all their lives and were decimated by thatcher in the '80s are motivated to achieve lower taxes for the rich and less regulation for big business?
12Xpert,yes i could. or alternatively i could say looking at it cynically that the stars group had asked them to get rid of it as part of a cost saving exercise to secure the deal and used the bad press about tipster affiliates as a means of doing it. their competitors said as much.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  believe  it is  that big.  that is  a figure  that is  cre point  into folklore and has no credible evidence to support it.  report that 4 percent  of their customers get restricted. but  it is  n overtime particularly hard to get that accolade at a recreational book setting loss leaders.
mschwimer,so do we have a deal. you spend 300k on 100 packages. we put $1m in an escrow of  years old you are choice. a free throw er 17 weeks if we are down units vs. betcris line you get the $1m. if n overtime we get the $1m.  do we have a deal?
RufusPeabody,i'm going to go on the record and say i  daily fantasy sports  think  59.36 percent  record from 12/8-2/13 is legit. i think multiple models were tested and they sent the best-performing one to cohnreznick a free throw er the fact. i could be wrong but would need evidence to change my mind.
RufusPeabody,the idea that there are people so bad at betting that fading them  betting the opposite of what theyre on  provides value is preposterous. yes the avg bettor is worse than a coin flipper (id guess like 49.7 percent ) bc of biases that they fall victim to but n overtime by much.
capjack2000,"that jumped out at me when discussing this with alf. 25 percent  is based on their nj mkt share. they had a significant 1st-mover adv in nj. 

in competitive states they won't have 25 percent  going fwd. plus igaming is a much more distributed mkt share. they will have states like nh though."
capjack2000,"hey you g overtime a better deal. run with it. 

 for what  it is  worth  if i ran a book 20 percent  is the number i'd choose. revealed in the dk/sbt numbers today is that 22 percent  of gross revenue is ""spent"" on promo bets for customers. so 20 percent  ratio seems fair."
capjack2000,"yikes...ok need to clear some things up here and it may take more than 1 tweet:

nevada  all us states: a cash transaction greater than $10k warrants a ctr (currency transaction report).  it is  a fincen requirement. no tax withheld and no w2g issued unless it is 300x  years old you are wager."
capjack2000,"i'm sure someone said ""oh we're a lottery ergo we withhold 24 percent  at $5k."" 

however  it is  n overtime who you are but what you are offering. you're n overtime offering a lottery nor pool or sweepstakes. you fall under ""other wagering transactions"" and the threshold is $5k and 300x the wager."
capjack2000,"tweeting about tax law and gambling is always tricky so let me state now i'm n overtime a cpa i'm n overtime a lawyer i'm n overtime even a black rapper from the caribbean. 

i'm only pointing out a silent partner you'll have to account for if you are betting sports in indiana."
capjack2000,the new unlimited player live bj at some nj shops is a real peach. the casino decides which hands you split and you decide if you want to play 1 or 2 hands. that 66 v t turns into t6 v t and you decide if you want to double down on it.
capjack2000,"pb could counter that most of these are runlines and totals and n overtime included in the ""guarantee"" - however  that is  n overtime the point. $200 limits on widely available mlb markets is unacce point able. 

if he's picking off stale lines - work harder to prevent stale lines from being posted."
capjack2000,they offer hundreds of wagers per game but if you display any indication of being sharp (ie: if you get  years old you are wager in better than the closing line) you'll find yourself severely restricted in the future on all bets. like $30 limits for nba games on the day of game.
capjack2000,while operators are taxed on gross gaming revenue th against the spread n overtime what fd is showing in this graph. they are saying if they didnt have to payout bonus money to acquire new customers theyd have a higher profit. their use of gross and net revenue here is dece point ive.
dinkinc,yes.  he has divided the country to a point where if he loses in 2020 there will be physical violence or worse. he has built up o you are debt very bigly and made a friend with a nice korean man who has also g overtime things done.  many things. really big things
dinkinc,made it through to day 2 of the venetian seniors but am short stacked... need to do something positive early or i will be home by noon. n overtime going to play senior event at wsop this weekend as i want to be 100 percent  comitted to the  fundraiser this saturday..come join me
ClevTA,my point was withers crying about the system being broken makes zero sense if teams still can make the playoffs  win a ws with home grown guys leaving. weve seen it a million times. does it suck? sure. is it the nba where lbj leaves  u are done for 10 yrs? hell no
ClevTA,i  daily fantasy sports  like the steelers. i mentioned that i am n overtime on either side my only point was i keep hearing how miami is an auto play and the line is bad. i was just showing how taking a team with such a mismatch on the lines isn't worth it
ClevTA,for sure. when freddie took over l assit year they used 12 a ton and they were #1 in the nfl in success rate. obv with obj now i knew theyd go 11 more but th against the spread just too much. if higgins is out id def would expect much less 11
CizzlingSports,which part of the above is hearsay? or we could start w/what information you have that could lead any reasonable person to conclude kelly offers value to the topic of betting. and if  years old you are parameters and protocols  daily fantasy sports  require reasonable diligence well then u g overtime me there.
spanky,"i run a technology advanced sports trading firm. o you are goal is to beat the closing line which yields winners. 

this ensures the worlds best handicappers will always indirectly work for me whether they like it or not.

i dont work to beat the market i make the market work for me"
spanky,"ill go for middles if my position is either very high or if the line has over moved and there is value on the other side.  

its important to understand that both sides can be the sharp side. it all depends on what number you get and how it compares to the close..."
spanky,"great point.  i ke point  my mouth shut for 18 years.  

my hand is on the pulse.  i'm in contact with many other pros and bookmakers worldwide.  i've seen so many ""pros"" come and go.  they either lose their edge or go broke.  

i honestly have no idea how i rank amongst others."
spanky,"been getting lots of dms about  
- the event is free and open to everyone until venue capacity is reached so sign up.
- my buddy jon is running it and he plans to run a bunch more.
- special guest  is gonna talk nba. 
- lots of cool people will be there."
spanky,why n overtime just use a live line. this is 2019.  do you expect a consumer to say no problem he liked it this morning at that line well give him a pass .this is a live market that waits for no one... unless of course youre in fantasy tv land bullshitting away.
spanky,with the hard rock ac opening their sportsbook i'm thinking about heading over there this weekend or next.  this is the only sportsbook le free throw  in atlantic city that will book my action.  will they turn out to be the sole bookmaker in ac or join the other dressmakers? we shall see
spanky,while i agree that most places dont like this i completely disagree they should feel this way.  as a bookmaker you are there to write business. hang a number to take a hit. who cares who gives you the bet? cris pinny grande would never care if you g overtime off a bet.
spanky,hey  despite how sharp the customer is if you can n overtime book a dime on an nfl side 1 ho you are to game time you should n overtime be licensed to practice bookmaking in the united states of america.  10 fvuckin dollars!!!  can someone out there save us from this tyranny?!?!
aluckyaday,that is the so free throw book model. its how as a bookmaker you maximise profits. but for the recreational punter its n overtime a bad model. they get many promotions and free bets get to bet in many more markets. modern sports betting is part of the entertainment industry. just like casinos.
aluckyaday,need a big pocket to be a partner. although i  daily fantasy sports  see why spanky would insist on that split. i would have thought the bigger the percentage spanky can get the better it would be for him. maybe it is an easier sell to say i win the same as you?
aluckyaday,87 minutes and we are on for the full house ogogo scores for bristol and we are down to 3. 2 minutes in to injury time and doncaster concede a penalty and its only 2. a profit of 238.8 units evaporates to a 4.5 unit loss. oh the joys of high variance betting!
aluckyaday,well my guess is every us based book will be doing it the same way within a few years. difficult to compete without getting  years old you are share of recreational money. to survive you either you have to be better than pinney or switch to a recreational so free throw  book model.
aluckyaday,at the bottom of the l assit article there is an excel sheet to calculate distribution of the yield based on  years old you are roi number of bets and average price. although you are making a profit you may be surprised how o free throw en that can happen just by luck.
aluckyaday,i'm n overtime saying it is a problem with pyckio. i'm saying we  daily fantasy sports  know because picks have been deleted. we have no idea how many tipsters/tips have been deleted. we can n overtime therefore make an informed judgment as to whether the pro tipsters records are anything other than chance.
aluckyaday,breeching electoral law is n overtime normal. if the referendum had n overtime been advisory the result would have likely been invalidated. if  years old you are form of democracy is one where the side that tells the most convincing lies without regard for the consequences wins i  daily fantasy sports  want it!
aluckyaday,i think that depends on  years old you are size and whether you can bully the others. if you are big enough you can be localist. n overtime sure the eu is globalist they have just realised that to compete with the large localists usa and china you have to become bigger yourself!
aluckyaday,"i did ask a trader in one of their twitter ch against the spread and they said the margin is applied by the system so i took that as meaning they have no control over its distribution. but i guess they may have control over some of the inputs that ""the system"" uses"
joeytunes2,if used correctly humans would increase handle. they also need traders who understand how to use info and know what to do with it. automated is necessary as well. (jazz)was one of the l assit books that still used a human stage. and as of l assit year  they moved to mainly auto.
EdMillerPoker,"a couple sports betting industry thoughts.

theres a segment of the industry that sees customers as adversaries. that the object is to beat them every way you can figure out.

th against the spread n overtime going to be what succeeds in america. the right idea here is to see bettors as customers"
GolcondaFund,"einstein toward the latter part of his life also said ...nothing would benefit the whole of humanity more than the ado point ion of a vegetarian diet.""

i get strong opinions and all but i for one am n overtime into arguing against einstein tesla da vinci and the gandhi's of the world."
GolcondaFund,"look if 1 game means nothing why you still hurt from week 2's ""lock"" of the week which is silly to ever advertise as this is sports and nfl - where there is no such thing. stop trying to turn the tables dj and go find the next seabuscuit let me handicap nfl."
GolcondaFund,"though i love  jumping into the fray with us - fading browns concerns me

2 jets play was made prematurely admittedly by us where as o you are other essler came the night before or day of"
GolcondaFund,"did n overtime get to watch live.
what in god's green earth is this stupid play call? 4th n a fo overtime run wide? luke keuchly hand off makes more probable sense than this sprint to short side of field.
this is why the younger generation will be better coaches. they played #madden"
GolcondaFund,the hard part about handicapping this game is the worst o-line is going up against a team that gave up 3 combined points in their l assit two openers. n overtime to mention how focused/disciplined will a tanking team be vs. a well coached one? this cover is dependant on lj struggling imo.
GolcondaFund,"like what seeing from nix +4.5 auburn live play 2 percent  tw 1.66 percent

nonrandomalpha,unquestionably the sharpest money is on wall street + the l assit 3  years have been a bear massacre (in spite of fed raising rates). if politics guided  years old you are investing youd have been sheepishly sitting in cash as risk assets rocked n rolled 2 all time highs since election night
nonrandomalpha,thanks for listening! the ravens just faced 2/3 of the worst teams in the nfl; if anything the picture on them is incomplete. if the cards were a bit more aggressive the game could have been even closer. facing a cards team down their top 2 dbs the ravens still only scored 23.
LeeSharpeNFL,"cpoe is easier to explain than  expected points added  so i think it has a much higher chance of taking off outside of the analytics community.

you  daily fantasy sports  have to have a math background to understand ""how likely is a pass to be caught based on the length of the pass""."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  wanna push back too hard i like jahns' work and he himself said that nobody thinks trubisky will be the next brees.

but this comparison creates the impression that the bears should stick with trubisky and i strongly disagree. i'd love it if he were the guy. but no."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think i have to emotionally pr expected points added re myself for trubisky to get his 5th year o point ion picked up. that feels like a certainty at this point.

as long as he isn't actually full on extended. i  daily fantasy sports  want to be where the rams are now."
LeeSharpeNFL,"slight correction to the above. the 7th tiebreaker is doing this exce point  you rank each team in the conference #1-16 by points scored and again by points allowed. then the lower sum wins.

if * that is * still tied the 8th tiebreaker is as described (doing it for the whole league)."
LeeSharpeNFL,"a player getting cut doesn't mean they were a bad pick. you have more information when you cut them than when you pick them.

going off results subjects you to bias based on variance (and the dra free throw  has a l overtime of variance).

process predicts future results better than part results."
whale_capper,"are they going to ""try harder""? based on the way the eagles played vs gb probably... are they going to use ""the good plays""? maybe... will they make fewer mistakes? hopefully... all of this is reaching though and i think  it is  more sound to just rely on better coaching as an angle"

cr7 is in tremendous form and lyon are a middle-of-the-pack team in ligue 1 (fo you are points out of 14th). i worry a little about juve fatigue but they're by far the better side here. 

i thought either barca or juve would win. barca drew. juve gets it done."
DannyParkins,im gonna go to soldier field early since its such a great day. planning to meet up  and one other tailgate. anyone else g overtime one i should stop at? ill be parking waldron l overtime and heading over a free throw er the noon slate ends. would love to meet some  #mob.
DannyParkins,i loved eddie overall l assit night. yea i didnt know every reference im sure but you knew he had to do old bits so stuff like gumby buckwheat mr robinson was expected. thought it was cool to see his natural talent and how thrilled everyone was to share a stage with him.

l assit week the top 5 was identical more variety this week. fading im pretty hard coming in 11th. but none of these have value seems like a wide open field"
logan_matthews9,im n overtime a pro - nor will i ever be with my day job - but grinding a profit gambling and spending 16 hours a day doing it are n overtime mutually exclusive like some touts want you to believe. heres a short checklist to get as close to profitable as possible:
logan_matthews9,but theres value in having the best 11 players on the field too. jozy vs zardes is a whole different thing but putting pulisic central so mihailovic doesnt have to play is fine by me. designing the rb/cdm for adamss strengths and o you are consistent black hole at lb is cool too
logan_matthews9,bring in capela! solid contract fits the long athletic mold of tatum brown smart. locked in fo you are more years. 25 years old on a similar timeline to the other names - would also leave them with room to either bring back rozier or sign a replacement whereas vuc caps them out

PikachuBets,i mean tbf i didn't say he would personally make you dumber at props. just that by engaging with this offer one would be made more stupid. i stand by that. maybe he'll teach you good stuff at props in the session. but you'll also become a tan user  consumer = more stupid.

adamchernoff,good question. they are new to my show this year (buckeye pph wph and jazz). these are networks that take action from accounts (o free throw en larger players on credit) throughout the us which have an impact on nfl markets. you'd be surprised how o free throw en they push/pull prices up/down.
adamchernoff,depending on what you value most the majority of  years old you are effort will either go into asking the right questions for #1 or perfecting timing and creating opportunities to maximize #4. if you follow the five points above the volume of games bet and stake amount will n overtime matter nor...
adamchernoff,"it as truth. bankroll management sounds ""cool"" to most but it is largely irrelevant for those who are successful. the reason is that those who are successful can accurately define their edge and when you can accurately define  years old you are edge you do n overtime need to rely on confidence or"

ToddFuhrman,for me it always becomes stay away territory or it becomes a game that i make an extra effort to watch or dissect a box score a free throw erwards to figure out how an initial opinion changed so fast.  think this is why diving into a lean list can yield interesting results
12Xpert,but every time i look at this with different data the bias is in the same direction. i admit (and have always admitted)  it is  weak and it might n overtime be enough to make a profit in the real world outside of so free throw  bookmakers. but i'm confident  it is  real.
12Xpert,it is  indirect confirmation bettors move markets when they see value prices. whether you should bet with bet365 or pinnacle depends on who you are. if you're sharp at pinnacle then use them. if n overtime bet365 will offer you value until they decide they  daily fantasy sports  want to offer it anymore.
12Xpert,you work for o point a right? there are those who would argue you're a corporate slave owned to make profits for the few in this case perform group with revenues of half a billion and profits of close to 100 million. personally i think that would a silly position as is yours.
12Xpert,"how is ""i'm n overtime good enough to beat a sharp book"" which i'm on record saying many times being generous to myself? remember i'm n overtime selling tips. and for those who aspire to what part of this image is n overtime ""almost all sharp book tipsters are lucky?""  (sample is thousands.)"
12Xpert,but in many cases it hasn't removed subjectivity just added to it. makes great tv but then so did contentious decisions before var. so long as everyone is clear what var can and can't do and is acce point ing of it then  it is  fine and we can all move on. no?
12Xpert,ahh you reminded me.  when are you going to respond to my revolver complaint?  it is  only a few weeks now before i'm allowed to raise it with ibas.  that is  going to be so much fun. they're as broken as you are which is why you get away with what you do.
12Xpert,really bottom line for me now is that whatever anyone tries to do here to make this sector of the gambling industry a better place for people there will always be some looking to exploit and others stupid enough to be exploited so n overtime sure doing a new project will add anything.
12Xpert,"if you want but you're wasting  years old you are time. the bookmaker's margin will kill you. and  daily fantasy sports  confuse mean regression with ""what goes up must come back down"".  it is  actually what goes up has a tendency to come back down. so many misunderstand the distinction.  e.g. gambler's fallacy"
12Xpert,i've debunked  years old you are value. you've been offered the opportunity to explain why i'm wrong why you're n overtime just charting and data mining and back testing data to find patterns. you haven't bothered. i might be wrong but you won't say why. you won't offer the theory and test it.
12Xpert,but you still haven't answer my original question which i think  did for you. he said since buying this system became an o point ion  it is  failed. so what i want to know is whether all bets before that were available in real time or whether  it is  all just back testing
mschwimer,needs to be an interaction. must first show that they are jaded by their priors. i simply ask them questions. they will answer honestly. and they will come to the conclusion on their own that what i am doing is beneficial to o you are subscriber. they cant not. they are logical people
mschwimer,"1. check public sec filing. we raised $23m as a back stop. 
2. agreed over time this will happen. when it does we will shut it down
3. please change to never buy picks unless you get positive ev. up until now its been impossible to get that. we are changing the game."
mschwimer,exactly! books make money by evening out the line. jim murren (ceo of mgm) is a good friend of mine and we talked about this in person. no book has quants that determine where a line should be. only where a line is to get equal action. they all want to mitigate risk
SportsCheetah,massive deal in a pro-style offense. you have to credit day for scheming something that better suits him but  it is  also n overtime the first time a qb has improved a free throw er his freshman season so fields deserves credit for getting more comfortable in the pocket/patience. always had tools.
SportsCheetah,interesting thought/open discussion: sunday pit closed ~+4.25 vs lar. 14 secs into the game pit snapped it over rudolph's head and it resulted in a fumble/ touchdown  for lar. the rams were up 7-0 with 14:46 remaining in the 1q (and get ball 2h). what's a fair in-game line at that point?
capjack2000,"by  years old you are logic walmart should be run the same way a corner bodega is run. 

instead walmart uses their economy of scale to sometimes take a small loss on certain products because they know the customer will buy other things while in the store. 

even sharp bettors have leaks."
capjack2000,"things i'm against:
- logs floating downstream into a buzzsaw
- pigs being led to slaughter
- aspiring sports bettors being told they can win but in reality they can't. 

i can't open eyes for a log or give logic to a pig but i can enlighten sports betters to choose wisely."
dinkinc,first does the trend have any valu...there was a season many years ago where sacremento won 15 consecutive games on wednesday and it became a big deal.. that was just nonsense and has to be dismissed.. a trend like utah scores more points in the second half than the first may 1/2
dinkinc,you do know that going to a jersey sportsbook and filming  years old you are exclusion for being smarter than they are and then posting it on twitter is very similar. i support both of them and they both made me laugh.  dont call the kettle black spanky. youre better than that
dinkinc,daily i scroll through twitter and find at le assit one picture of a dog who is sick or recently passed. i understand why these pictures are posted ..today someone posted multiple remains of dead horses from a case closed l assit year..didn't need to see that and it harms legit rescues
robpizzola,"yesterday you were going on about how judging plays by closing line value is the wrong way to calculate a true edge but the first paragraph of this says ""the opening line is much easier to beat than lines throughout the day and closing line"" which is a direct contradiction to that."
RASPicks,we've always graded at a fair wa line typically a conservative average of cris pinn bo pph at time of release.  lines move fast.  it is difficult to follow for most people and we state this up front.  we provide a pro-rated refund to anyone who wants to cancel for any reason.
RASPicks,we've had a public archive for 15+ years that automatically documented all releases at start of game. in recent years we've switched to a semi-private service but no one has or would ever question the accuracy of o you are records and many of the top pros on here would support that.
suuma810,"#nfl betting tip

bettors love to buy points on key numbers to increase their win percentage. but books wouldn't offer that o point ion if it was profitable for the bettor. the cost of buying usually negates  years old you are advantage on the number. try line shopping and reducing the hold."
suuma810,i just  daily fantasy sports  think those two things should affect  years old you are decision-making in 2019. defenses spend 70 percent  of the time in sub packages and edge rushers need to rush the passer. kc d will face a higher pass percentage due to their offense getting more leads too.
suuma810,"at this stage we rarely know enough about upcoming rookie qbs.

no doubt about the protection issues but we knew about them before the season started. he wasnt good in clean pockets either. ex: his 0.19  expected points added  in clean pockets - according to pff - was 0.08 below league average."
suuma810,played lac +7 in a buy low / sell high spot. pre-season line was +3.5. chargers decent on offense but still g overtime outplayed rams offense is sick - had 9.5 ypa. expected more pressure by lac really missing bosa and liuget. blocked punt  touchdown  made up for the end zone pick.
ClevTA,michael u need a 2 and a 1 no matter my scenario or yours.  its the same exact thing just in what order. u still dont get this point so we cant have a real debate bc of it. its fine u think  years old you are way its n overtime problem
ClevTA,kicking was a bad idea bc it easily could get blocked or when u miss u lose those extra 7 yards bc of the  field goal . if u dont get it on 4th down if u go for it then jax doesnt even have time to throw a quick a pass
spanky,"bob given that personnel change from year to year how is something like this even relevant?

do you believe in any way this trend has any predictive value?

is there a logical explanation on why something like this exists?

if  years old you are bets arent based on trends why mention them?"
spanky,vd made half a million on selling a losing pick on the sb and went to eat a big steak dinner a free throw erwards.  you apologize for giving out free advice and then write paragraphs explaining variance.  while everyone appreciates  years old you are kindness recognize you dont owe anyone anything.
spanky,the perfect hustle may be unfolding.  bet the loser and drive the price down. have the world believe that the integrity of the oscars is indisputable. next year bookmakers nationwide offer higher limits and  daily fantasy sports  move as aggressively. of course th against the spread when the knock out blow lands
spanky,lol!  finally the truth comes out.  i'm obviously a threat to  years old you are earn.  just always know that i'll always eat steak and you will just have my crumbs.  i run this racket. find a way to become better than me instead of wasting  years old you are time hating
spanky,if i told you what i bet then some twitter nerd will reverse engineer my plays threatening my livelihood.  i came on twitter to help change the path of sports betting in america. self promotion was a byproduct simply so my voice would hold weight.hope i'm n overtime sounding like a jerk
spanky,agreed that 10 percent  for 5 months is great but the v assit majority of futures players are holding far less than 10 percent  and the v assit majority of them dont have unlimited bankrolls.  most of my betting is done on credit and during football season its more precious than blood.
PlusEVAnalytics,ok lets go at this a different way. suppose youre right and 9 reds in a row tilts the odds of the 10th spin in favo you are of black. why arent teams of professional roulette players waiting to pounce and max betting black so much that they bankru point  the casino?
aluckyaday,the vig on each side of the bet is n overtime always the same. you can say what it is on the whole market but n overtime on each side. the fav/longsh overtime bias is well know but there may be other reasons why books favo you are one side of another.
aluckyaday,"if that is the case then you had better let the secretary of state know. or maybe you have n overtime read the act? in section 2.2 of their statement of principles required by section 23 of the act. ""the commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public"""
aluckyaday,that is how business works . it is their job to make as much money as possible without breaking the law. it is n overtime for them to determine what the laws are. that falls totally on the law makers. customers can always object on moral grounds by voting with their feet!
aluckyaday,only a small percentage are problem gamblers and they are n overtime limited to small staking players. do you think it is ok to allow rich problem gamblers to play but to block less affluent ones. the issue is n overtime absolute limits but finding a way to identifying those at risk.
aluckyaday,they are only efficient on average. pricing errors appear to be random but i believe pinnacle etc play with the line when they can. for a bookmaker betting at an efficient price is sub o point imal. they have market and customer models to find the line that make the most profit
aluckyaday,people seem to forget that a bookmakers job is to extract as much money as possible from punters whilst managing the risk. pretty sure they know a l overtime more about doing that than anyone who is complaining. the fact that punters are complaining is a sign they are doing it well

joeytunes2,i have a confession. this is my bot. it knows the outcomes of every sport event from 2001 to 2053.  it is  crazy to think that i already know that the miami dolphins win the superbowl this year. but  it is  true. it also predicted  the charleston chiefs would win through violence.
joeytunes2,i wont even bet the super bowl. my number was kc -1.5 which i said l assit week or 2 weeks ago. this line is dead on. it will draw nice 2 way action. i dont  bet to gamble so this is a easy pass. i'll look into the more prop route.
joeyisaks,th against the spread actually pretty fair and standard price or a medical type / grade massage.  you are lookin at 175 on low end you should try cr years old for  years old you are back pain.. i tried physical therapy accupuncture massage and cr years old only thing that worked
EdMillerPoker,what i think is so crazy about that strategy is theres literally pricing errors all over the menu ok. i know lots of people from the gambling world that all they want to do is sit there and click buttons all day long but because they arent dumb they see the errors
EdMillerPoker,"again this is beside my point. n overtime worth arguing it bc you won't convince americans. no american will read that william hill rugby story and think ""oh fair play correlated parlay go ahead and chop it  it is  just like a $1 car""

almost zero americans even those in the industry."

LeeSharpeNFL,"#1 i assume everyone's treating sb as neutral.

LeeSharpeNFL,"i didn't adjust for down and distance but the lines look similar enough that i'm n overtime sure that would be a good use of time but maybe it is. 

this was also only one idea. is there another reason playoff games would actually be causally different here?

curious as to thoughts."
LeeSharpeNFL,"also note that nflscrapr tre against the spread the return team as the possession team on kickoffs (n overtime that kicking team).

PikachuBets,youre right matt. i can sure afford a l overtime of pokmon cards now! im such a loser troll when im way busier than you every day actually betting instead of pretending like im some hot-sh overtime winner who has a passion for writing shitty blog posts with ghost lines. bye felicia
PikachuBets,love cit/cbi/wncaa lines are easier to beat. i watch all game film for analysis. objectively cit  with tourney. 50- point  blowouts 30 percent e field goal  in r64/r32 is trash to watch.  percent enjoyable games b/w the 2 are probably near equal. i love supporting wncaa but early rounds are just unwatchable
adamchernoff,westgate follow the land based model which has been perfected by las vegas over the p assit few decades. rotation numbers game sheets odds screens are all pr expected points added red and widely available for bettors. the work is done to prep the bettors and the tellers just execute the comamnd.
adamchernoff,"interesting betting note. i think?

between open and close for week one green bay baltimore and buffalo are the only three teams which had a line move in their favo you are to cover. 

atl/ minutes under and bal/mia over the only two totals to finish win for the direction they moved."
adamchernoff,to be clear i  daily fantasy sports  think there is anything wrong with saying something like fangio has extended practices this camp in pads more than any coach in the league and scangarello said there will be a huge emphasis on efficient passes to rb's and te's using a three qb rotation...
adamchernoff,bet365 will give you a ~$500 until you win 2-3 bets then youll be down to $1 max. pinnacle varies from $500-$20000 depending on to you are feed round and game state (use asian view). no clue on 5d. best bet is either exchange with third party interface to avoid the queue/processing.
adamchernoff,i am planning out my podc assit schedule for august and for some reason this nfl betting/bookmaking topic keeps coming up in my head. i thought i would talk about it in this thread to get it off my mind and possibly offer some insight to others this a free throw ernoon.
Ccon8181,my numbers have #buccaneers being a play today at +3however situational importance for #texans . im going to pass. n overtime sure how buccs cover. n overtime willing to risk my $ to find out. however this is the #nfl so refsleague wanting tex/tenn game next week to mean something in effect
Ccon8181,i try to knock down as many shops as i can before the line settles. so im going around in person and on apps. little time. posting for free but investors get my lines. working on a solution where ill release as soon as i hit so others can snag same lines.
Ccon8181,bro i was like  what the fuck !!! how does this guy have a job. he marked him for a 3 yard gain a free throw er being tackled at line of scrimmage... the head ref with the emphatic 1st down signal on that 4th down stop is still all time though.
Ccon8181,im still in shock how the #ra point ors blew that l assit night.. siakum was forcing shots and missing all night... van fleet missed a bunch of looks and quinn cook lead gsw?! kawhi with 5 turnovers and mia shooting minus going to the  free throw  line. damn that was brutal!!
Ccon8181,sure is. i think i get  years old you are point. but do successful day traders get se against the spread on the board of the companies they invest in?the definition of investing is putting money into something where you expect to profit.but nothing wrong with being a recreational gambler.difference of opinion
Ccon8181,sorry for n overtime getting my tweets out sooner on contrarians invested sides. for those wanting to tail. ill provide more time going forward. was slammed this p assit weekend trying to lock in bets in person. deposit/re-load the apps all a free throw er betting for the fund. with that said.....
kellyinvegas,i cap all of my games. if the number moves with my side im happy (reverse line move). a) i g overtime the best of the number. b) the public is probably on the other side. i never need to keep it interesting in my life. have plenty of excitement as is
ToddFuhrman,"hardest thing to differentiate between as a bettor is what constitutes bad bet vs bad result

ToddFuhrman,"it is  always easy to talk yourself into making a bet

next time try to make a case against  years old you are wager before placing it because it forces you to unpack every handicapping angle and helps to avoid impulsive/emotional betting

if you've explored both sides and still love fire away"
12Xpert,"listening to bbc now. ""all i heard on the doorsteps is how is this going to be paid for how is this going to hurt my business?"" there's  years old you are distrust.
""sort out o you are views on the economy.""
""present ourselves as a world stage player""
""deal with antisemitism."""
12Xpert,years old you are child analogy is interesting. evidently you see certain adults as children that dont understand the consequences of their actions. i see it rather differently. those children as you call them are sick of being patronised about wh against the spread good for them by people who face no...
12Xpert,true. but puzzle here is why you could still make a profit if you bet closing prices of nish's tips. if clvh is correct and pinny are paying attention to nish that shouldn't happen. the point of my analysis was at le assit to show their closing tennis prices aren't fully efficient.
12Xpert,"you did say ""definitely something to take into account for the future."" but actually you haven't the slightest idea if it is you're just assuming it because you've started shit this season so draw the conclusion that it might n overtime be a good idea to start a season at the beginning"
12Xpert,and if that is n overtime what the european elite is striving for then they should be straight will people and tell them it means more greek-style bail outs. the eu is like a cancer patient receiving endless cycles of chemo that have hugely unpleasant side effects just to keep it alive.
12Xpert,really no point at making an official complaint to the  because whilst they will agree with me then ask the offender to stop and then tell me that they have been assured they will stop the respondent will then carry on as normal. th against the spread how this thing works right?
12Xpert,a though experiment. suppose bookie offers a market on a coin toss (they do in the form of odd/even e.g.). suppose  it is  random who bets what side so expected is 50-50. using binomial with odds of 1.95/1.95 and 100 bettors there's a 38 percent  chance bookie is exposed (52/48 or worse).
12Xpert,ive honestly never thought about it. i suppose in a sense any of these bets are really binary o point ions: player scores or does n overtime score. if you then compare score odds to the true scoring rate of the player youll get an idea of what margin the bookmaker applies.

mschwimer,how hard is it to understand? the point of jambos subscri point ion service is to provide financial value to its subscribers.  we are currently doing that.  although we are also currently losing money doing that.  remember o you are subscri point ion service is roughly 1 percent  of what jambos is.
mschwimer,"also i didnt include today because today is n overtime final yet. 

week 1 subs won over 2k
4 week subs are +$
17 week subs are +$ a free throw er they get 10k from us because we are - units

only sub that is negative are week 2 solo packages."
mschwimer,yikes. connor you clearly have no idea how this works.  is the host of the show. period. he does n overtime decide who comes on the show and certainly does n overtime have anything to do with twitter handle decisions. also im done texting during the nba finals. series is too good.
jeffma,years old you are original tweet called zimmer brain dead for making what was arguably at worst a 50-50 decision. then you reasoned that it was a worse decision because of rodgers. to me these show a pretty poor analytical skill set. and a lack of understanding of process driven thinking
SportsCheetah,"his scheduled ""first reevaluation"" is in february. they can easily say he needs 6-8 more weeks at that point and the season is about over there. and since their actual season is over it just wouldn't make sense to rush one of the league's biggest stars back (the league gets that)"
SportsCheetah,siakam probably #2 for me for similar reasons luka is #1. siakam arguably a top-5 mvp candidate this season and a free throw er losing kawhi. toronto hasnt really skipped a beat (and lowry has missed 11 games). n overtime the norm for mvp-level guys to be in mip mix though.
SportsCheetah,interesting there's probably going to be very nice ou to make the playoff price around this week in that case. chances of all 4 winning according to the current market is ~39 percent  and then there is the ~33 percent  of the time oregon just be against the spread utah anyway.
SportsCheetah,minutes o35.5 -102 - prob my le assit favorite decision yet. is okogie/wiggins/culver/bates-diop/covington a viable lineup? we may find out. they have a l overtime of the same guy + teague + kat. best drtg in nba l assit season when cov was healthy. maybe culver was the missing piece? \_()_/
SportsCheetah,the best bets collectively have been bad the l assit week and a half or so. it happens. to be fair i dont think anybody else that gives analysis claims to be a professional (but something we should try to get more of on the show in the future for sure).
capjack2000,from what i've seen they use location services in conjunction with ip mac neighbor ip running processes known history and more to build a risk profile. if the story doesn't add up the plugin says no dice. even if it does add up all of that is compiled for future use.
capjack2000,"i le free throw  this out of the thread but fortunately these laws  daily fantasy sports  affect professional gamblers. their wins and losses are calculated ""above line"" on schedule c. 

filing as a professional is a whole other threshold and introduces se tax but for guys like us it is necessary."
capjack2000,"it makes you wonder why he would hedge though. if this promo drives sales just run it every year. unless hou wins the ws 6 of every 7 years it is effective. 

i think the hedge is because hes an assit ros fan and doesnt want to ro overtime against them."
capjack2000,"i'm actually n overtime in favor of minimum bet limits (mbl).  it is  n overtime the most effective way to build a sustainable market. 

i'd like to see bookmakers be transparent with their liquidity so you know what volume of risk they'll take before you wager. 

 it is  nuanced of course."
capjack2000,"dont expect to get $30k per point on their fantasy offerings. even $30/ point  is impressive. much higher ceiling though. some settle as high as 1000x but you need to also front for black swan events. 

its a fun product and has consumed hundreds of hours of my time this year."
capjack2000,"this probably should be a blog post but with a backlog of content already i'm going to make it a twitter thread titled: ""beware of the license to steal.""

i returned from a week away and noticed some of my online nj sportsbooks wanted me to approve new license agreements 1/9"
capjack2000,i think nj overtakes nv in monthly handle briefly in august. i  daily fantasy sports  think they'll achieve the top sp overtime in annual handle before pa or il top them though. ultimately it won't matter...for now it is a novel benchmark to gauge how f assit the industry is growing.
capjack2000,"you may be right but almost every new igt machine has some sort of ap vulnerability. they could eliminate the vultures if state of play ends with the current player. 

i believe they choose n overtime to because the perce point ion of being beatable attracts more overall players. ie: bj"
capjack2000,*if* it happens...and who is to say ny won't screw it up even then. look at pa. 2nd largest gaming jurisdiction in the us to nv. they passed sports betting in october 2017. l assit month they did $44.5m in handle; nj did $372m. legalizing it doesn't insure a viable market.
capjack2000,"caesars gets access to dk's v assit database of men age 21-45 and they hope that'll grow ancillary businesses beyond what they're giving up in online sports wagering. 

we did see that dk's market was apparently untapped for online casino revenue in nj a free throw er they entered that space."
dinkinc,today marks the l assit day of dinkfund for awhile... there are a few reasons that this has become necessary but none of them have to do with the charity whatsoever ...  is still the website to donate and i will know within a month if it is realistic to return
dinkinc,someone  who is an ass took  my tweet about se point ember variance as an excuse for my losing plays.. first the roster expands to 40 and aa players get thrown into games with no rhyme or reason..second i post my results every day..accurate results..third i tout for charity so stfu
dinkinc,we're just praying for the end of his time to hurry up and arrive...cause if we have to spend another fo you are years with him i  daily fantasy sports  think that o you are country will survive..... i am sure you have gotten this before but i just had to
robpizzola,jerry has been a friend of mine my entire life. he is n overtime the brightest guy in the world but his passion is unmatched and he is a perfect example of what we should all aspire to be from a work ethic perspective. thanks for giving him a shout out.
robpizzola,no periscope happening but did manage to put together my numbers. carolina +110 worth a bet (i think they should be favored). blues -1.5 +133 is technically playable but i  daily fantasy sports  play edges that small so  it is  just canes for me in r2. everything else out of range.
robpizzola,probably should also point out the limitations with scoring chances and high-danger scoring chances. n overtime all of them are created equal. if vegas is generating scoring chances that are 1.5x more likely to net them a goal which they did in l2 vs cgy you need to account for that.
RASPicks,thanks and btw my views on closing line value have evolved a l overtime since then.  i've moved closer to  years old you are view but n overtime for any of the reasons discussed in that thread.  the current market is more complex than ever.  harder to know what is what.
VegasRefund,"so... if a player is traded from the al to nl (visa-versa) apparently his st against the spread reset. but do his st against the spread reset on pre-season prop totals (i.e. machado)?

this scenario just came to my attention and if anyone has an official ruling on this please share.."
suuma810,"sup michael!

passer rating is n overtime qbr. however playing bad for three quarters  then getting to 14 or 17 points with a drive in the fourth quarter is  years old you are message? id guess the chiefs would trade for those game winning drives because mahomes has less than allen."
suuma810,"but why do we think hes just running all the time next year?

hes in front of the second year leap  still at the beginning of the learning curve with a new oc adjusted scheme and new weapons. 

plus he probably doesnt need to be elite for bal to win games."
suuma810,would have been a stronger angle l assit year but n overtime enough for me when you have arguably the worst pass d vs what looks to be a solid team. skins off their bye have no clue how to attack them. penalties and blown coverages been killing them as well.
suuma810,#betting week one early or late is a philosophy thing. you can get great value against the closing line but you miss out on a l overtime of information e.g. injuries. the injuries to #cowboys c travis frederick  g zack martin are a prime example why bettors would like to wait.
ClevTA,no reporter on the planet has been more accurate than glazer. obj never denied saying it all he said was hes here next year. one has zero to do with the other. either way my issue is with maniac fans tweeting at reporters threatening families kids and in general being inhumane
ClevTA,u know th against the spread now how this works. he would get suspended no matter what. in that case anyone can say anything publicly. do we know if his lawyers provided any evidence? the appeal details arent typically leaked right? so maybe he had reasons for keeping just for courts
ClevTA,denver has 0 sacks are missing callahan and are ranked 26th in dvoa defense. elite is n overtime what i'd call them. minnesota on the road is a good n overtime great defense. they are bottom 5 in completion  percent  allowed to qbs. this offense is n overtime good bottom line.
ClevTA,pff pass block grade for mccray was a pitiful 32.4. his run block grade was 87.8. pretty much the rest of the ol was avg or excellent in terms of pass blocking. tretter bitonio and hubbard all had solid to really good pass block grades  for what  it is  worth  #browns
CizzlingSports,a point of the l assit 24 hours is that the po you are sap who paid $250 for 50 picks wakes up on 9/7/19 and out of nowhere sees that s/he has to put $9250 in play a free throw er already loosing $1879. on a $250 package. betting $300/game.
CizzlingSports,"started selling  college football  picks two seasons ago. he g overtime worked in 2017-2018 losing -18.8 units. he then predictably claimed he only gambles ""for fun"" (a free throw er taking subscribers' money of course). he then sold picks again for 2018-2019 and g overtime worked again - -11.9 units. lol"
spanky,"the tout/pick industry is worse than doing crack. most of you all just want that next winner and that next sweat.  

stop focusing on individual bets winning and instead come up with a long term strategy/game plan.

this business is a marathon n overtime a sprint. there is no easy way."
spanky,"the major tool that most bettors lack is timing. understanding the market and knowing the o point imal time to play. 

making a line 2 and betting +6.5 is good; but knowing if and when the opportunity arises to bet +7 makes a big difference. 

this art takes years to grasp."
spanky,when i was kicked out of  l assit june i asked the manager how would customers feel if they found out you kick people out.  he told me they never really find out. the public needs to know that if they get good enough one day they will be limited/booted.  #unamerican
spanky,my speed in catching numbers for the l assit 20 years has contributed to grabbing the check fast.  youre an exce point ion rufus but truth be told most advantage gamblers have alligator arms when the bill comes.  they unfortunately cant turn off their edge hunt when in a social setting
spanky,hanging an under on top of an over is one of many practices that are brought from overseas with no consideration for what an american sports bettor is used to. log into any offshore sportsbook and/or visit any lv sportsbook and start learning.  do you guys do any research at all?
spanky,would be better to do so but i'll take a stab.  a bet creates a bet which creates another bet and so on.  when you keep writing bets and move  years old you are number accordingly you create enough volume to allow the vigorish to overcome  years old you are liability.
spanky,if you build on someones existing so free throw ware dont you think they should be compensated?  and 17 years is a super exaggeration. buddys office was paying bob up until just a few years ago. im n overtime a bully pal ill just call out  years old you are bullshit.
spanky,"the first book i ever read on sports betting was jack more - the complete book of sports betting (1996).  it explains the ""blindfold method"" which laid the foundation for my business as it is today.  if anyone knows how to reach this author i would love to personally thank him.."
spanky,"says i had bad behavior when i never even entered the joint. fact is they  daily fantasy sports  welcome winners.
heres my 4th nj banning:
saiful at  giving me high tens promising me 8k.
i lasted a few weeks but was banned the day a free throw er i won 65k!"
spanky,when i was betting on saturday at resorts i bet 1300 on  college basketball  total.   i waited a few seconds and bet it again.... i was told someone from vegas called over and told the supervisors to tell me i need to wait 1 minute before i hit a line again....
spanky,im n overtime ashamed or afraid to publicly admit that i dummy lines.  many pros have done it for decades. its crazy  that 10 years ago when bookmakers moved on action it took 10-20k to dummy a line vs. today a well positioned $500 bet could black out the screen.  (1/2)
spanky,heres a video i forg overtime to post midday where my college football was cut from 20k to 10k. this of course is all before i was ultimately knocked down to 2k on college football. they say a guy named jeff made the call. im assuming that jeff is jeff davis
spanky,equitiesforexcry point o short term investing is dangerous for sports bettors. why? because most people are either too emotional to acce point  a loss or too greedy to lock up a profit.  its a bet on a game that never ends where you check the score all the time.  emotionally draining.
PlusEVAnalytics,"dear legal scholars of gambling twitter:
if schwims 10k refund on a 3k package is legal doesnt that create a loophole wide enough to give every street bookie in america a free pass?
schwim has assured me that the refund has been cleared by the very top of the us government"
PlusEVAnalytics,any adjustments to kelly for epistemic uncertainty are ad-hoc (bet half k because im n overtime sure how accurate my edges are) but there is a better way using bayesian posterior distributions to find the o point imal k fraction you should use. any interest in an article on this subject?
aluckyaday,"this is the crux. worldwide bookmaking has changed. america was le free throw  behind because of its protective practices. now it has opened up market forces take over. the ""european"" model is the most profitable way to run a book. american pros have to ada point  like the european ones have"
aluckyaday,that is one thing that has come out of brexit. the benefits of lying outweigh the downside. hoping tomorrow redresses the balance a bit but unlikely to happen if the betting markets are to believed. that said 30 percent  is n overtime that unlikely just less likely than 70 percent !
aluckyaday,there is a good reason for the deliberate delay. without it you will get absolutely killed by courtsiders. even with the delay it can still be a problem. in tennis for example they seek out the weak umpires who are slow to enter the data. in horse racing they fly drones!
aluckyaday,"why n overtime just look at pinney for the right number instead. i doubt denise co against the spread would appreciate you calling her dumb. how many people running ""smart"" bookmakers were paid $340 million l assit year? global bookmaking has changed whilst america has been stuck in a time warp!"
aluckyaday,depends if you want to be a long term winner or just be able to brag about getting lucky on a 40/1 shot. for some the dopamine utility of a winner is more than the financial utility of long term profit. without value long term profit can only exist through luck.
aluckyaday,personally i have 2 definitions of sharp. recreational sharp and true sharp. depending on which bookmaker model they can beat. most if n overtime close to all are the first category hence why there is a l overtime of moaning about limits. ones in the second category are very rare indeed.
aluckyaday,it is quite a big talking point in the uk at the moment because of what happened with fobts. were they deliberately targeting problem gamblers. the findings did n overtime go that far but did conclude they were causing harm to vulnerable people. maximum stakes were cut from 100 to 2
aluckyaday,thinking about it the calculator requires level stakes. i'm guessing that is unlikely if laying unless you are laying to lose a fixed amount. you could replace the yield standard deviation calculation in f7 with the sd of  years old you are actual returns. i think it would then work ok.
aluckyaday,in the uk recreational punters are also given best odds guaranteed on horse racing. if a horse dri free throw s you are given the sp rather than the price you took. that is worth much more to a recreational punter (who will n overtime be restricted) than any minimum bet.
aluckyaday,you can perform a hypothesis test to get a level of confidence that  years old you are returns are n overtime due to luck. it depends on the price and how many bets you have but you can put a number on it. a l overtime better than just saying probably!
aluckyaday,long time since my a level physics but.... force required to keep an object moving = kinetic friction * normal force. normal force = m*g. so proportional to mass. because the distance of a race is large compared to the winning margin a small effect over a long distance is enough
aluckyaday,it makes no difference who is leader. changing leader does n overtime change the parliamentary arithmetic or the eus insistence on the backstop. unless whoever wins  has a magic wand once the election is over it will be back to where we were with even less time to sort it out
aluckyaday,ha ha a common issue when americans talk about gambling! it is good to highlight. but i it think it would be better if you said some touts or unethical touts rather than the implying it is what almost all touts are doing when you are exposing the methods they use.
aluckyaday,i know they do that for the running order but what about the order they announce the votes. betfair remains open during this period (seems a bit weird to me as some people know the results then again some will know the jury votes a free throw er the rehearsal anyway!).

EdMillerPoker,"thoughts no one asked for on gambling bo overtime camp events. poker  daily fantasy sports  sports betting ap whatever.

these are tourist experiences. the target audience are wealthy people who like las vegas and love the movie 21. what they want in exchange for their $$$ is primarily a social experience"
EdMillerPoker,"for what  it is  worth  i've n overtime met a single american person working in the industry who sees it this way. i've met some non-americans with roughly this attitude.

in the end american sports betting will be run the american way. o you are culture and values are too strong."
EdMillerPoker,"and this allows them to undercut the entire market by offering lower holds.

its industry dogma that customers dont care about hold and i agree theres some truth to that.

but then again the guys currently at the head of the pack also hang the lowest holds.

n overtime a coincidence."
EdMillerPoker,"so this game is very average-average. averageish pregame line and neither team has a big lead. this is the easiest type of game to model. you'll find more errors when games have outlier inputs of one type or another. very good or bad teams. big leads.

or like any college game."
EdMillerPoker,casinos do this imo. they want 000 roulette tables but some of them go ahead and convert all the tables to 000 which seems nuts to me. why wouldnt they leave a good table off in a corner where the in the know people could go? maybe theres some logistical reason.
EdMillerPoker,generally agree. a wrinkle i rarely see mentioned is that if you care what happens with  years old you are book on the timescale of years a publishing contract could be dangerous. i expect publishers to start declaring bankru point cy being acquired etc which could leave a book in limbo

nonrandomalpha,it is  simple my standards are higher than yours. fsu makes excuses for their players' poor performance both on/off the field. we  daily fantasy sports  (or used to not). maybe you should consider a grad degree with a school more aligned with  years old you are lazy apologist and 'look-the-other-way' ideology
nonrandomalpha,using a real name gives you more polish class + professionalism. the silly af handicapper pseudo names is a gen x/boomer fad that is dri free throw ing away faster than their betting acumen. when big $ starts to enter the industry pro investors won't be allocating to 'fat wallet weston'
LeeSharpeNFL,"i do sincerely appreciate you calling attention to my outliers it can help find places to investigate for improvements.

i expect  it is  probably over valuing russell wilson relative to sea as a whole. also sea has a l overtime of injures and i  daily fantasy sports  model individual non-qb players."
LeeSharpeNFL,"it is  interesting (and i wonder how strong that component is  analysis seemed to suggest n overtime very).

 it is  a credit to the qb to identify and target the more open receiver but n overtime one if the coach's play design creates more opportunities to throw to an open receiver."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i'd rather have goff than trubisky but i  daily fantasy sports  think the answer is trubisky.

AndyMSFW,anyballs golf is just like anything else you can bet on and the learning curve is filled with hazards (golf pun absolutely fucking intended).  so i'm just gonna keep talking to people who are more seasoned and try to make a coupla units to use for nfl futures in the fall.
AndyMSFW,"i will be playing a very degenerate system that we do every year in the desert where i spray money on a bunch of underdogs.  these are very small bets as this is super volatile and more just about cashing some fun tickets. (-22 ""units"" in 2017 +24 ""units"" in 2012)"
JoeyKnish22,we were gonna pay an instagram model to say she was dating rob and promote the play but a free throw er she watched this mornings periscope she doubled the price. we had to back out. maybe ill just pay the parlay queen or some shit like that on the cheap.
JoeyKnish22,wasnt in the mood to enjoy this a free throw er that 3 ho you are jet plane crash l assit night. but ravens afc north futures did cash. i know a l overtime of people jumped on board and rode with these so happy it g overtime to the window.
JoeyKnish22,weve been motivated by the unlikeliest source ( and have decided to donate 5 percent  of total pool handle to charity. well take some extra entries to make up that delta. well also screensh overtime the donation. if i finish in the money ill also donate a portion of my take.
JoeyKnish22,"cyber monday buy low futures sales

JoeyKnish22,"heisman race is basically down to 4 players. i know what the odds say but i really dont think hurts can win it without a l overtime going wrong for the other 4. 

burrow tua fields young. 

looks like osu media is trying to rally around young more so than fields."
JoeyKnish22,osu has been amazing best team in the country. but michigan g overtime healthy on the dl has input some schematic changes to deal with osus offense and has fixed the run game. youre buying low here on michigan as this is about is as high as ive seen this number.
JoeyKnish22,hell be 31 has had 4 season ending injuries isnt close to the player he was and is famous enough to be the next romo or big studio personality and make great money doing that. had also alluded to in interviews he doesnt plan to play that much longer. no chance?
JoeyKnish22,very possible. i wouldnt have played at the 25 to 33/1 range most places posted i saw silvas take but i think the volume probably ends up somewhere in the middle of pre and post stefanski. likely n overtime enough to lead but was okay with a sprinkle at the price.
JoeyKnish22,wouldnt waste money on morant/rj at low odds with zion strong chalk. list is basically a combination of good st against the spread bad team guys guys who flashed in summer and guys who should be able to contribute immediately. again zion will win this without an injury. so tread lightly.
TheKostos,"daniel jones will be fine. he's shown signs that he has the potential to be really good.

LockyLockerson,trends are stupid because they completely ignore what the number is in the market.  if you can quantify what harbaughs effect is (if there is one) and implement it by all means you should make that a part of  years old you are handicap in creating  years old you are number.
LockyLockerson,"i went to bed really early (hal free throw ime) because i am battling a cold.  i forg overtime to dvr so i could watch the second half.

but a free throw er reading everything it seems like i missed absolutely nothing and probably would be angry had i stayed up."
LockyLockerson,"if you end up watching this tonight there's a part during kobe's insane shot-making in the 4th where the broadc assit goes to break on a sh overtime of snoop dogg celebrating in the crowd and  who is calling the game has a really understated ""for shizzle.""  i laugh every time."
EliHershkovich,"you jumped in when  it is  interspersed throughout this nd lovefest.

DannyParkins,one (of many) things i respect about the athletic is they clearly have a policy in place to support and share each others work. even writers of different sports share stories recognizing it helps build the brand. i try to do this but we all could be better in sports radio.
DannyParkins,my buddy i golf with all the time g overtime 2 hole-in-ones in the same round today at hawks view in lake geneva. im devastated i wasnt there to see what has to be one of the most statistically unlikely things in all of sports. hes probably a 15 handicap. incredible.
DannyParkins,was at a sports bar for dinner with both games on and the almora and anderson incidents happened so closely together that was surreal as it was an example of the scariness and stupidity of baseball. ive never seen a player and team react like almora and the cubs did. horrifying.
DannyParkins,ive seen the  sportsbook and its awesome. tons of tvs seating kiosks and a bar right there. its g overtime everything you need. there will be a mobile o point ion youll just need to signup at the casino first. also youll see a l overtime of  there im quite sure.
Gingfacekillah,a free throw er watching the tape about 6 times the nicest play for det imo was the horns set for their first bucket. plays to the starter strengths and doesn't require drummond/griffin combo to be overly mobile. staggered screen was decent too. have to get jackson away from hero ball.
Gingfacekillah,this wouldn't be a play atm because its n overtime a blowout and its too early to fire. but just keep updating when you see a game get away from a team 10+  points  when its p assit the 10 minute mark in the 2nd half. you'll likely see some value.
Gingfacekillah,yeah totally. been thinking about my chi/det forec assit today. one idea is that both teams play a low variance style. call it like 70/30 paint vs perimeter play. so maybe looking at what  percent  of a teams scoring rate base comes from which style of play can eliminate bad games.
Gingfacekillah,so i worked on this l assit night and found an o point imal weighting using solver that improved accuracy by about 0.16 percent . good start. i'll probably have to learn r in order to implement the other ensemble machine learning ideas that were also suggested. thanks for the advice!
logan_matthews9,i'm n overtime 100 percent  but pretty sure they won't be able to get kemba and capela/whoever in a st unless kemba is also in the st. a trade exce point ion wouldn't allow them to sign kemba with it. they'll have to part with more than just picks (likely hayward)

adamchernoff,i tried combining different st against the spread numbers injury values individual player numbers and situations which took me way out of my de point h and i think led to more inaccurate pricing and overfitting than it did provide any benefit or profit. i scrapped them and started to focus...
adamchernoff,when i was on the bookmaking side of the operation earlier in the decade i had ratings which would help keep the price point between teams consistent week to week. a portion of the work that went into the ratings accounted for players and p assit support in the betting markets.
adamchernoff,hate to complain about folks doing their job. but calling a game is a chance to paint a picture and entertain the audience. these guys have missed two downs in the 1st quarter and continuously moan about calls post play. a wasted opportunity to say the least. shame on these guys.
adamchernoff,interesting again? based on prices  line movement this week went 5-9 on sides and 7-7 on totals. l assit week sides and totals each went 4-12. of 68 possible sides and totals this nfl season only 20 (29 percent ) of games have ended in the direction of which line moved.
adamchernoff,words to the original tweet when i started betting football in 2007 i can certainly relate to how easy it is in this industry to be misguided. hope this thread might help one or two folks see it quicker than the years of losing consistently and making mistakes it took me.
adamchernoff,hard to go back and get the data. there was a column i read a while ago that based it off win/loss record but 7-6 one year can be different from the next. but it showed must wins around 44 percent  and nothings around 55 percent . have you found anything?

12Xpert,it doesn't have to be the opening line. any line will do so long as  it is  relative to the closing line with juice removed from both lines. surely you agree with that. this a free throw er all is how you calculate closing line value in the first place right?
12Xpert,"""we'd just like you to stop kvetching and move to israel were you'd be happier.   just exodus from us and never interact again until time ends.""
""just like you asked someone to stop saying jews control tv?""
""jewish iq....""
""because jews  daily fantasy sports  go to jail?    duh""
well done billy."
12Xpert,of course  it is  likely that someone spending 50 on the horses is n overtime likely to learn much. but if financial risk taking was taught properly in schools then perhaps it would reduce the incidence of problem gambling. clearly demonising it is ineffective much as the war on drug is.
12Xpert,"well you have to think of this as a data mining exercise. if you endlessly test data until you find something you want to find and then declare it meaningful you may well be ""deluding"" yourself (i hope that translates into spanish). hence why you need to use a p-value correction"
12Xpert,nice. but remember that when recreationals are offering lines that diverge from pinnacles by more than the effective margin it will be pinnacle that is on the right side and eventually the recreationals will close  years old you are accounts unless you take steps to disguise  years old you are activity.
12Xpert,georg cantor went mad thinking about different infinities.  let us  n overtime go there.  let us  just agree that if you would bet finite $ against liverpool winning and would find yourself in an emotional state of preferring liverpool to lose you are n overtime a proper fan as defined here.
12Xpert,this question is only relevant if the closing line value hypotheses (that  it is  a good predictor of profit) is correct. many disagree with it. anyway i tried to answer it with this. for a margin of about 2.5 percent  i cam up with a figure of about 70 percent .

mschwimer,only way to get that info is to pay. or get from a friend that paid. thanks for signing up! please do n overtime post o you are plays to the public anymore. as you know you are n overtime eligible for money back if you post o you are plays.
mschwimer,did i ever say he endorsed us? i said we both hate the tout industry. both of o you are biggest reasons for hating the industry is a lack of transparency and financial accountability. we are putting o you are money where o you are mouth is? but you are not.
mschwimer,people have told me their site allows action regardless.  however i checked with 2 us books and they agree with what you said.  i will go back and look at each pick that was made before a pitching change was announced and make those no bets. thank you for the help!
RufusPeabody,this is n overtime a model for predicting how good the teams are; this is a model that predicts how the  college football  playoff committee ranks the teams. it doesn't make much sense doing it a free throw er 5 weeks but i was curious what it would look like.
RufusPeabody,i know i'm a broken record on the tout thing. i know touts won't go away. my hope is that the needle moves in the right direction for consumers. that transparency will beget more transparency and become an expectation.and that scammers will stand out like a sore thumb to everyone
RufusPeabody,ok so 80 plays and 56 percent  is ~ 6.1 units per season of profit. off topic but what do you expect moving forward? market much more efficient now. publicly released  picks have averaged 54.5 percent  over 8 seasons with 85 picks/year but lost 2 of l assit 3 years.
jeffma,fair criticism. im n overtime trying to publicly shame people but i do think it is important to be able to talk critically about each other (as you just did) it makes us all better and keeps us accountable. but agree there is a fine line between constructive and negative
capjack2000,"fair point. you would want to wager on something longer odds with  years old you are free bet to maximize ev. 

however since the super bowl is usually a ""must wager"" by every sportsbettor on the planet a case could be made that the utility value is the full $100."
capjack2000,"legit. most online sportsbooks in the emerging states have aggressive sign-up promotions to win  years old you are loyalty.  it is  worth  years old you are time to do them all.

capjack2000,nobody is disputing that you can make a large cash wager in a book. however between ctr's and sar's any book would prefer you wire in the money. the fishy part of this guy's story is that he went to the bank and they just handed over $85k to him.
dinkinc,in the old days before don best bookmakers moved lines more aggresively since players had to call each bookmaker and get a rundown... which book moves their lines be assit and if you were a bookmaker would you use the consensus line or do something different to write more business
dinkinc,it was pretty clear when she ke point  bringing in horses in big groups and asking for donations at 7 times the amount from any other feedlot.. paulick called her out as it was obvious to him and then finally someone went to look at her unado point ed horses..
dinkinc,you post these correlated parlays and i am sure 99 percent  of the people here are unable to play them...  even if they did they shouldn't for fear of n overtime getting paid... if you can bet them  that is  great but this makes you look weak in my opinion
robpizzola,"twitter is a bad platform for this discussion but my thoughts:

RASPicks,n overtime sure how many times i have to repeat this for you. when someone is proven to be so flat dead wrong on something they are so adamant about how do you trust that person to do anything else they say? i'd much prefer to focus on other endeavors.

ClevTA,browns losing by 2  touchdown s is 100 percent  in play potentially sunday. mixon running for 100+ dalton to boyd a few times mixed in with multiple sideline blowups from the browns all extremely possible. if u want freddie gone how do u n overtime ro overtime for disaster anyways?
ClevTA,wait u are starting laird? yuck hes awful. if u have obj or landry at wr id start baker. same with allen at wr for rivers. absent of all of that id go fitz bc he gets rush yards and no adams for jets. and find a new rb lol
ClevTA,wait u are agreeing? lol. the thing with the seattle offense is russ is amazing and the only thing holding them back is the ultra conservative offense from schottenheimer. when they are forced to throw  rely on russ they are deadly. for freddie to assume a 3  out was crazy
ClevTA,3 gms of the 9 were at home and brissett with the p against the spread was the only winner. 56 percent  2  touchdown  3 int for those qbs. the other two guys g overtime blown out. may n overtime mean a ton but interesting for rookies on short weeks

#neverforget"
spanky,the opening number today is stronger than its ever been. you cant beat the closing line if it never moves off the opening line.  as bettors we have the disadvantage of paying vig; but we also have the huge advantage of getting to pick and choose.  passing is a must.
spanky,my system auto grades. one of the guys in my office will sometimes break down the good or bad fortune to me but i rarely watch anything live.  once the game starts there are either more sports to bet or productive things to do.  watching sports has sadly become unenjoyable.
spanky,n overtime only are bettors exem point  from any wrongdoing in us v baborian the federal court concluded that congress did n overtime intend to include social bettors within the umbrella of the statute even those bettors that bet large sums of money and show a certain degree of sophistication.
spanky,i hear ya but somehow someway he convinces people to send him money....there are thousands of liar touts out there... why does he get the lions share of the subscri point ion money? because he can sell an eskimo ice.  look p assit the unscrupulous acts and admire the hustle...
spanky,fascinating story.  i can only speak as a sports book customer as  has cut me down to minute amounts in their sports book and ultimately banned me.  if you're a winner they kick you out.  if you're a loser they sue you to get every damn penny.  typical corporate vegas
spanky,thanks for everyones support. retweet these videos and spread the word.  tell  years old you are elected officials we did n overtime hire you to welcome companies (the majority of which are foreign) who mistreat o you are citizens by resorting to the extreme measure of banishment.  this is unamerican!
spanky,ill be in vegas next week at   n overtime asking for any red carpet; however given how ive been treated by all these so called bookmakers here in nj all i ask of  and  to promise to n overtime kick me out and give me fair limits.  thanks in advance!
spanky,my guy in vegas several years ago lasted 3 weeks before he was cut down. i could bombard these places with runners and post 25 more videos.   but wh against the spread that gonna do? im trying to address the problem at the root.  still searching for a real bookmaker.
spanky,this may be such a minute point but it stuck with me for years and i thought id share it.  if you are going to play the lotto you should always play numbers above 31 eliminating the birthday factor. this will of course reduce the chance of chopping the jackpot.
spanky,shopping around and knowing what a half point is worth is crucial.  do you lay -3 expected value or -2.5-115 in college football?  should you take +9.5-110 or +10-120 in nfl?  unfortunately i wont comment on what i believe is right but knowing these answers is worthwhile for any bettor.
spanky,they fired one of the best bookmakers in mike c. and since then everything has went to shits.  nevada will never have another bookmaker book 40k on college football sides on tuesday for a saturday game.  a big part of old school vegas bookmaking died when mike c. was fired.
aluckyaday,"hmmm. its pretty easy to beat bfsp a free throw er commission on average if you can back early prices with bog. the problem with  years old you are argument is you assume everything would stay the same re prices/margins/early prices if ""winners"" were allowed to bet. it would not."
aluckyaday,it is a good idea rufus. in the uk for horse racing we have the horseracing bettors forum  but their is n overtime one for gambling in general. but you have to be careful n overtime to end up representing only professional bettors interests who are a minority of bettors
aluckyaday,even if the bet placement so free throw ware running on the users device reacts to those suspensions in real time (it wont some bets will still be rejected) it is still frustrating to the customer as the market suspensions are out of line with the pictures they are watching.
aluckyaday,brexit did n overtime happen because of this government n overtime parliament. to avoid a border in ni there are only 2 o point ions. a uk wide customs union or a border in the irish sea. the government itself could n overtime agree which they wanted hence no brexit.
aluckyaday,if their processes are correct losing bets should be at le assit voided at the time of settlement as well hence my question as to what happens to uncollected funds. then again if their processes are correct they should n overtime have been acce point ed in the first place
aluckyaday,although a winner has to be declared do they have to acce point  bets on that outcome? take  years old you are favorite will there be a safety prop. do the really have to offer a price on no? easy to get around if they do. yes 8/1 no 1/1000000000000000
aluckyaday,why should bookmakers pay more for racing than they do for other sports? are punters willing to pay more to bet on it than other sports? times change gambling has changed. if racing can n overtime survive in the current climate without special treatment then it must change or die.
aluckyaday,for all those saying its anti money laundering show me the am law that says you can't have  years old you are own money back? its because they have worked hard to get you to deposit they  daily fantasy sports  want you to back out at the l assit minute.
aluckyaday,so in view of this i am going to start a twitter service. on the 15th of each month from now on to be known as data mining day i will publish my lucky 15 to this twitter account for free how can you lose with such a fantastic roi...
theFirmAISports,haha i knew i was forgetting the retrograde effect! but yeah nfl is all small sample size and i never claimed o you are models were perfect. for this model keeping the day in lowered the error slightly in backtesting and cross validation but i know that != future scores.
EdMillerPoker,but the mature gameday major markets in big sports like nfl mlb nba  college football  are tough to beat. totals generally easier to beat than sides. the people who do beat them almost all do some substantial analytical work along with trading (rather than just see line bet line done)
EdMillerPoker,yes you have way more kidney tissue than you need which is why an nfl player can have a chronic progressive kidney disease like fsgs and n overtime even know it. the percentage of intact tissue handles the load until it gets below a threshold and then kidney failure starts.
GolcondaFund,"who is ready for week 4?! 
another 5-0 should put us in first or tied with 1-2 other top performers.
4-1 might be tough to cap mvp honors and a 140k split.
3-2 no chance.
 
 
should we do a live show saturday as we consider o you are final picks?"
GolcondaFund,"1st - thanks for listening we  appreciate it
2nd - the chirping is mostly in regards to the ravens of week 2 as the egregious -13 was suggestive that the ravens were either the best team in the nfl or the cardinals the worst - both obviously n overtime true."
GolcondaFund,"this play sums up everything that is pediatric about trubisky. 

stares down receiver across far side of field corner endzone. meanwhile former bear amos reading him like cat in the hat

 years old you are eyes i see
to the ball throw me.
bears beware 
of the trubisky stare.
#packersvsbears"
nonrandomalpha,talent is equally distributed but its the lack of opportunity that prevents people from success? i have interviewed hundreds the l assit two years and this is demonstrably n overtime the case. it comes easy for some it takes persistence and moxie for others and some will never get it.
nonrandomalpha,"it can be tricky to #bet nfl week 1 - a l overtime of unknown variables in action and many teams are priced on unsubstantiated speculation or inapplicable p assit performances.

we looked to see how (in)accurate #nfl spreads have been v. final scores in every week 1 since 2011."
nonrandomalpha,that is  n overtime even taking into consideration taxes. all to say unless you have a $5 million bankroll and can implement and scale  years old you are bets accordingly a young part-time skilled handicapper isn't going to be making life-changing money. the supercontest does at le assit offer this.
LeeSharpeNFL,"why are you assuming ""clutch"" is a thing that a team ""has"" and has predictive value? 

you show the pythagorean expectation in the chart there: that has been shown to be predictive and is low for gb suggesting we should expect gb to perform worse than other 13-3 teams have."
LeeSharpeNFL,this is true but i think ultimately n overtime super important. we may n overtime yet be at the stage of one universal definition but we all understand the metric's goal and the philosophy of inputs behind it. as you say the differences are minuscule to the point of irrelevance.
LeeSharpeNFL,"sadly for life reasons i had to bow out of working on the big data bowl but i was analyzing it the rb's speed and acceleration *were* strong predictors so i guess that element matters.

but then again i assume coaches/scouts are already filtering out players who can't run fast."
whale_capper,always a tricky proposition but with those two teams in particular n overtime playing each other until the end of the year you have some flexibility you could potentially sho overtime for the middle on one or the other because some has to win their week 15 and 17 games
AndyMSFW,"recap - 
bryson was damn close h against the spread off to the wolff.  losses were minimal and almost went 8-0 on h2hs.  still need to figure out what to do with round 2 h2hs
+5.832 units

match-ups: 7-0-1 (+6.258)

JoeyKnish22,i have gad (generalized anxiety disorder). earlier this year had a real rough bout of anxiety while traveling. felt like i was losing my mind so i sought help. g overtime on some anti-anxiety meds and regularly therapy sessions. within a few weeks was feeling like my old self again.
JoeyKnish22,finally g overtime around to listening to this. really enjoyed it. this wont be pickzzz or generic game analysis so if you want that go elsewhere (theres plenty of others). if you wanna hear real deal stories on working in the business being an accounts guy this is very good.
TheKostos,"i'd like to issue a hearty eff you to the cincinnati bengals for their asinine handling of aj green this season. played with 52 instead of 53 players all season and wait until week 17 to put him on ir. 

and most impoantly you screwed fantasy owners who stashed him!!!!!!!!!!!!"
TheKostos,legit think the judge hire is either going to be an unmitigated disaster or a roaring success. one of the two. and i'm fine with the gamble. i actually like the hire more than i thought i would. much happier now than i was an ho you are ago. #allrise
LockyLockerson,some would say i've been on arkansas state too much already this season.  hasn't been great at times.  just wanted to say i'm on them again tonight at +6.5 so be pr expected points added red to be mad again.  good luck with ucla stanford if you're untangling that mess.
LockyLockerson,"lar-oak: despite frostbite and painted helmets the raiders are -4.5 over another nfl team.  as we've discussed previously on this thread  that is  too many points for any team in the preseason.

lar +4.5 to win 1x.  bm has a +207 lar  moneyline currently we'll nab that too for 1x"
LockyLockerson,i've been putting off seeing toy story 4 because i watched toy story 3 in the middle seat of an airplane and had to try to avoid bawling at the ending while stuffed between two strangers.  that was traumatic.  toy story 4 will be viewed with no one else around.
LockyLockerson,imagine saying a sport is in trouble and providing no evidence.  cfp title game was a blowout but during first half ratings were great.  new years games up in ratings when nothing is up ever.  more  minutes spent viewing and discussing games than ever on all platforms.  just go away.
DannyParkins,dude the expert handicappers ive asked on  say its gonna be 3 points or less most likely im saying th against the spread wrong. its n overtime some outlandish stance to say the team on the longest winning streak in the country and the defending champs is the best team.
DannyParkins,bears havent faced a l overtime of adversity in-season since nagy became coach. cody parkey incident ended the year and everyone le free throw  town. now his starting qb who people were already losing confidence in is hurt  roquan smith has a mystery personal issue. big test for young coach.
DannyParkins,if you have proof that this person didnt have that intention please share it. i hope he didnt seems unlikely. but if he did hell surely denounce the ban and declare his innocence so as to n overtime be branded a racist and be allowed to return to wrigley right?
DannyParkins,that has been used more and more as a sym best of luck of hate and white supremacy by some of the worst people in the real world most notably the new zeland shooter who killed 50 in a mosque. to ignore that context would be to be willfully ignorant.
DannyParkins,dude we haven't patted russell on the back once today assuming you're talking about us. please be honest if you're gonna subtweet the show. i said i hope he doesnt get an ovation was surprised they stuck by him and that he still isnt forthcoming in his answers. be. honest.
DannyParkins,ive found  years old you are comments on this very interesting i agree the grandstanding on twitter in the immediate a free throw ermath is just shallow pandering. but you agree colorado should be in his obituary right? and isnt that wh against the spread happening now? obituaries and eulogies.
Gingfacekillah,its really cool to see other people that are enthusiastic about the process. modelling is fun. if you take the approach that failure isnt a setback but rather a learning experience youll be amazed how far youve come in  years old you are process even a few months from now.
Gingfacekillah,"k can be set to do different things. higher values track recent team form lower values track general ""class"" (as  put it on his website). try one of each try a weighted combination of 2 different variants. it can also depend on how you set elo up to trade points."
Gingfacekillah,as a long suffering pistons fan i'm always a little hesitant to lay more than about 4 points on them. most of their victories are buzzer beaters and heart-attack inducing l assit minute plays. chi however like nyk should be no problem. i like det -8.5 and the over (barely).
Gingfacekillah,how much  percent  adjustment is a different goalie worth? ive o free throw en wondered whether a goalies st against the spread describe team defence more than individual performance. plus backups are put in at inopportune moments: injuries blowouts back-to-backs. had done some work modelling a team save percent .
logan_matthews9,very impressed with schauffeles bogey free tournament. so many tough holes especially in the bad weather yesterday. may have made a mistake n overtime giving him as much credit as normal for l assit years win. lots of very good golfers around him so n overtime interested in +350 though
logan_matthews9,i think his stubbornness with regard to tactics is overstated. he tossed the rb-tucking-to-cdm bit pretty quickly. he has an idea of how he wants to play and th against the spread fine its his adjustment that just havent worked out yet. im more concerned with his team selection stubbornness
logan_matthews9,right that would be my guess too. so theres a diminishing value in the service but if they offer a pro-rata refund th against the spread n overtime an issue. if you had a big enough br with enough outs i think it could be +ev. youre only talking $30/play
PikachuBets,"if you properly store and secure anything it'll be monstrously difficult. true for anything physical or digital. but using a mexican gold coin heist to say ""lolol can't do this with btc"" is retarded. bc there is very much a btc equiv of shitty storage that can be stolen easily"
PikachuBets,"all he has to do is si free throw  through vegasinsider pages to look for that 20- minutes window when a vegas shop hung that extra 0.5 point save the screensh overtime as evidence he ""caught"" the line when someone comes to call him out for being a pumpkin eater"
PikachuBets,first play of the season and already going full scum tout with fake berry kelly stakes. line is only available right now as a  best of luck opener at $250 limit but he is betting 22.74 units wowowowow. also lmao at 5 mlb units is a regular unit #unitinflation #berrykellystakes
adamchernoff,"i didn't get the memo and took my podc assit ""bye week"" l assit monday. this seemed to be the one though. three of the shows i listen and watch have skipped their usual monday/tuesday episode or had replacement hosts. how will we know what to think about week 12?"
adamchernoff,well said. i think a l overtime of the handicapping stops at the qb for most which makes 17 all the way down to 14 quite reasonable. but as you mentioned a l overtime more going on with the game than that. mia potentially without their entire starting secondary too.
adamchernoff,in a coin toss the probability is always 50/50. therefore if all bookmakers were offering coin toss odds any bet a bettor could make at greater than positive expected value / 2.00 would have a positive expected value (+ev) which suggests long term profitability if the bet is made consistently.
adamchernoff,"the 2019 nfl season strength of schedule matrix is a handy tool to keep around you desk this offseason. 

all 32 opponents listen by implied probability to win the super bowl. full season opponent sum plus start and finish schedule ranks on the right. 

 = top 8
 = bottom 8"
adamchernoff,"i built the michael shackleford 1st inning pricing model and explained step by step how you can do it too. 

as a beginner im n overtime afraid to ask for help either. if you have any thoughts or would like to be in the follow up send me a dm."
adamchernoff,"i  daily fantasy sports  step up and take too many risks with  college basketball  but it was a nice +1.25x win with auburn -9 tonight. below is a sample of what the 165 members of the simple handicap slack channel received. 

n overtime in the channel? you can join here:"
adamchernoff,"unfortunately many gambling ""experts"" tend to get very upset and have hurt feelings when others disagree. n overtime the case with me i appreciate it and think you are right to question the kc d. i certainly do. this is just a very game state dependant matchup. thanks for reading."
adamchernoff,oh no whale! dont say goff is a liability late in the season - when the game slows down and he has to deal with pressure in his face. i did that about three months ago (albeit 3 weeks early) and it hurt a l overtime of grown mens feelings.
Ccon8181,"howd all the coin flippers do on yesterdays # college football  games?

while im pumped for the start of football you wont catch me reaching on games just to have action. its a long season patience is key. i embrace the grind and am ready to get back to work!"
ToddFuhrman,i'm n overtime lauding the ncaa here by any stretch but to call it a dictatorship is insane for people that have endured real dictatorships.   it is  n overtime indentured servitude nor are these kids forced to play college sports.  the value of a scholarship is massive and always overlooked
ToddFuhrman,"oh theyre coming out in full force already and it makes me laugh 

i never changed my political views growing up but went from being liberal at a conservative boarding school to conservative at a liberal university. the absurdity of that in and of itself will never case to amaze"
ToddFuhrman,ha for as much as we pick on clay have to give him props for the nba sweep in back to back nights.  saw an opportunity with durant and took it every which way so  it is  all on me figuring out how to apply pressure to close the week
ToddFuhrman,"star watch

12Xpert,and  let us  be clear sharp books will have just as many compulsive big losers as anywhere else. they  daily fantasy sports  need to encourage people to lose because their model is all about acce point ing anyone and allowing large stakes really large stakes much larger than recreational books.
12Xpert,neither position is credible. there are always unknown consequences of government policy and these will impact low and middle earners. those who do (like mason) are completely devoid of an understanding of uncertainty. o you are biggest problem is we  daily fantasy sports  know what we  daily fantasy sports  know.
12Xpert,friday to sunday's 57 woc matches showed a loss of -32.9 percent  compared to an expectation of +3.87 percent . monte carlo says only 3 percent  of these will be worse. if anyone doubts the influence of short-term variance on real world outcomes here's the 100-bet running average time series.
12Xpert,"here we go again. the words 'monopoly' and ""footballdataco' (please that is n overtime me) seem to go hand in hand. in 2004 the ecj ruled against them copyrighting fixture lists. this will end up back there. i suspect they are quite keen for boris to get brexit done beforehand."
12Xpert,if you're aware of it stop going boom and misleading punters that profits mean skill.  years old you are whole position on this is tautological. i effectively asked you whether profits at a roulette wheel imply skill and you said obviously n overtime because that involves a random distribution (1/2)
12Xpert,he's going to outperform nearly all those who think that they can outperform him. there are people who say they bet for a living. most of those will go bust because they never actually had skills better than the pinny trader who's access to the most sophisticated models and data.
12Xpert,"yes and yes. so you're right we would probably expect this. this is n overtime so much an attem point  to say the ratings are rubbish more asking the question ""what is the point of pre-closing ratings like these if they aren't sophisticated enough to do better than closing odds?"""
12Xpert,the bottom line is that for a professional bettor any bet with negative expected value is a bad bet and shouldn't be placed. maxi's systems are negative expected value based on nothing but pattern spotting data mining which is basically just alchemy. i would never bet on stuff like this.

mschwimer,o you are site has been free and available to everyone for more than 6 months. we have hundreds of subs. including many pro betters. if we were making it up a free throw er the fact dont you think we would be called out for that by now haha.
RufusPeabody,good point.  that is  why it needs to be for the life of someone's subscri point ion. if people have different starting dates and can cancel anytime that incentive isn't as strong. plus could have a commitment to only having plays be between 1 and 3 units or something.
RufusPeabody,"has always been something  that is  varied from book to book. believe it or n overtime this is an area where the offshores have traditionally been better than the us books. important to read the fine print. does it say ""must start for action""? if n overtime you're sol."
RufusPeabody,full disclosure: i had this idea in 2015 between drinks 1 and 2 on a second date. we had a mock vegetable dra free throw  that went 10 rounds took longer than it should have and ended up being a *successful* date. avocado was a first round pick obviously.
RufusPeabody,jeff asks if well have sharks and minnows like in  daily fantasy sports . yass thinks th against the spread n overtime going to be the case. there arent sharks and minnows in the stock market. everyone is getting the same price. (dont think this really answered the question)
RufusPeabody,my experience with the  app was another story. i deposited 20k hoping i'd be able to bet most of it. i quickly found the limits made that impossible and only bet through 7k. learned the hard way that unlike in vegas i can't just get the remaining 13k back.
RufusPeabody,"think about this troy. you have to go for it at some point right?

by going for it a free throw er first  touchdown  you get a chance at redem point ion if you fail by converting the next two times.

by waiting you only have the one chance."
jeffma,"a. i dont have  years old you are cell phone number 
2. you need to explain this in a public forum
iii. since you are so big on betting with kelly. wh against the spread the bankroll that $300 unit better would need to be full kelly with jambos"
capjack2000,"do you want an unfiltered view of what  it is  like to bet professionally? do you miss the sopranos? 

this is sportsbetting reality with a healthy dose of ""jersey charm""

 has a podc assit and  it is  definitely n overtime ""sucky."" 

worth  years old you are time to listen:"
capjack2000,"its regular sportsbetting if they ever get around to taking bets. its lottery controlled betting. as such they wont know how to take a loss. 

expect them to freak out when they have a losing day. then add sbtech on top of that and its going to be ridiculous."
capjack2000,"sign up promo is 100 percent  match of first bet up to $100. 

all the new sites going live seem to be capping their sign up promo at $100. hmm...a collision of collusion? 

sign-up process is a bit lengthy considering they could pull everything from njdge with my ssn."
capjack2000,"oh i agree...and  it is  used as a catch-all by operators. they can also claim aml/kyc and instantly be sacrosanct. 

however what about regulations to prevent the freeroll against players? maybe just the l assit 30 days of winnings can be seized. maybe set the bar of proof higher?"
capjack2000,to calculate the average margin translate the odds of yes to implied probability and add them all together. it will be over 100 percent . that amount over is the margin. you can then factor out that  percent  from the original odds to come up with a vig-free line.
capjack2000,there are numerous tax advantages to being a self-employed professional bettor. its a good setup for getting money into the system and using it for other purposes. sitting on money you cant declare has a big opportunity cost to future wealth. pay the tax and then make it work.
capjack2000,"bet365 has a reputation of limiting. th against the spread why redefining their rep might help. 

unibet created kambi so 

superbook has a good rep on the whole. 

thescore is a great unknown. new operation with a different vertical approach. could be great could be in over their head."
dinkinc,lawlor really referred to them as kabuki warriors one and two.. that is  n overtime only insulting but anyone listening immediately thinks jobbers... vince is like trump...thinks his audience are morons and tries to appeal to them .. kairi and asuka are so much better than becky and bayley
dinkinc,my friend  is fighting on espn plus in a bit ...i was hoping to be able to bet on her...  she opened at 12-1 and i hesitated thinking i never laid that much on anything....  she is now 40-1 which may be the highest line ever in mma history
robpizzola,vikings offensive line entered tonight with the 5th best adjusted line yards and 11th best adjusted sack rate in the nfl. the packers figured out a way to attack them and minnesotas coaching staff did absolutely nothing to ada point . that was piss poor coaching plain and simple.
robpizzola,"if we're going to pretend like this one wasn't racist we can refer back to when he said ""natives have an inferiority complex when something happens to them"" or we can look at the fact that he refused to roster any european players when he coached in the ohl."
RASPicks,fading the public could be useful is the rare instances where square public money influences the market but this doesn't happen and/or isn't easily identifiable o free throw en enough in today's markets.  otherwise if we agree it doesn't work blindly how is it useful as a first filter?
suuma810,i cann overtime bet on either team here th against the spread why im passing. harbaugh was hopeful he starts. i would actually like ravens more with lamar because he possesses a big threat to the bengals d on the ground. ravens ocs familiar with that kind of qb.
ClevTA,guess if the alternative for baker was darnold and for ward was chubb or minkah so u would essentially be in the same sp overtime in either case. so u have to evaluate the rest of his moves. and th against the spread what i would do. its bad
ClevTA,seattle is 7-2 with only a +18 point diff. they have faced the 5th easiest sked in the nfl so far. based on pythagorean expectation they should have 5 wins right now. russ is my mvp right now bc the rest of that team esp the d is garbage
spanky,"a pick is only worth the line its bet on and if it had any value the line probably wouldnt exist.

one mans opinion wont outweigh the market long term. instead of searching for winning picks focus on beating the closing line. doing so will eventually yield winners organically"
spanky,i grew up a yankees fan. maybe im overreacting but chapman smiling a free throw er blowing the season is disrespectful to his team the fans and the game.  never been a fan of athletes who dont put winning first. this aint the yankee team of oneil and jeter.
spanky,"i aint giving my mother in law $3.50 let alone 3.5 million.

using beards is n overtime a long term strategy as they will eventually also get kicked out.  

states should n overtime offer licenses to bookmakers that must resort to the extreme measure of kicking out its citizens."
spanky,good question. i think the limits were game day only.  for football im sure they will have breakdowns throughout the week on when limits will go up to full house limits. the guys that run the joint are bettors and i believe they will offer everyone a fair shake.
spanky,looking forward to making 50 new friends tonight. my apologies if i sound like an idiot. l assit time i spoke in front of a crowd was at my daughters second grade show-and-tell parent occupation.  kids hated it teacher thought i was a mobster. other dads seemed intrigued though
spanky,has been booking my action for about ten days.  im very pleased with the experience... they have very sharp people behind the scenes and the management has been a pleasure to deal with. theyre n overtime afraid to book a bet... one of the best in nj. highly recommend!
spanky,started taking 8k from me the first day.  then it went down to apprx 2k/1k which lasted a few weeks with choppy results.they bought me steaks put me up at resorts etc... then one saturday i held 32 percent  won 65k and i was banned the very next day.
spanky,despite knowing of me or knowing me personally very few bookmakers book me directly.  without betting partners getting me outs i would be out of business.  i rely on the anonymity of offshore betting accounts to run my business.  its a cat and mouse game that is very tiring
spanky,my buddy  just reminded me of a great bookmaker outta new york named fernando.  i was too young to see him book in ny but he ran hollywood sportsbook down in cr for years.  he was such a great bookmaker and an even better man.  i miss him dearly.
spanky,many uneducated sports bettors  daily fantasy sports  understand the power of middling games.  many professionals including billy walters utilized middling as part of their arsenal.  middling games is a great way to build up  years old you are bankroll.  knowledge of what each half point is worth is critical
spanky,and  matt and jeff.  i was given  years old you are contact info as the ones to talk to about cutting me down so severely at   you slowly but surely cut my limits down to $500 on an nba side!  i understand bookin' ain't easy but come on now.
DocBettor,youre expecting +3 units for  years old you are package with added vig/cost of $1245. given preseason nfl limits and what youve seen l assit 2 years what  percent  of subscribers do you expect will be able to get down enough at the right numbers to make it worthwhile?
PlusEVAnalytics,oh for sure but obviously picking off so free throw  markets is n overtime their mo. if youre trying to build big complex models i could understand how those models could struggle in the early season when they have to choose between current year and prior year data etc.
aluckyaday,if you are betting multiple markets and on average are n overtime finding closing line value then you are much less likely to be limited because you are profitable in just one. if you bet mainly one market and find closing line value you will be limited across all.
aluckyaday,"today's wisdom of the crowd football lucky15 prices with bet365 who give bonuses on football luckies

aluckyaday,i would think the problem with bm in the online era is they are n overtime going to get the huge recreational volume. trips to the casino for recreational players are a special occasion unlike online where they are going to place a bet on every game they watch.
aluckyaday,could give us poor lazy english speakers a breakdown of what has happened so far in spain in regard to bet365 and restrictions. what laws are being contested how far it has gone in the justice system and how much further has it to go? many would be interested.
aluckyaday,its an interesting question. i guess it depends on how efficient the opening lines are (probably n overtime very) then how many of the contestants can detect the ones that arn't. as its you i'm guessing you have modeled it and know the distribution of the answers  good luck
aluckyaday,exactly that correlation is why they reduced the stake to 20p. but correlation is n overtime the same as cause. every good gambler knows thatthey also know that when making a negative expected value bet the more you stake the more you will lose long term vulnerable or not!
aluckyaday,well if i had been running my machine learnt nfl model l assit season it would have returned a level stakes roi of 6.13 percent  at consensus closing handicap at -110. n overtime statistically significant but in line with what i would have hoped for  let the season begin!
aluckyaday,without the numbers i'd be searching for a reason cognitive closure. need to drop irish racing maybe? but because i know i'm beating the closing line by about my average i know its just variance. this is why you should do the numbers  keeps you sane in the downturns
aluckyaday,maybe the reason why we have n overtime discovered intelligent life elsewhere when a life form has the technology to contact others they also have the tech to destroy themselves! ask the actuary what is the chance of 2 independent life forms surviving long enough to contact each other?
aluckyaday,"it is difficult because winning is n overtime a good indicator of ability. survivorship bias is a big problem. because there are so many touts some will win through luck alone. because they win by luck they get more attention and ""survive"" those that are unlucky and lose disappear."
aluckyaday,portillo is a good example just had to wait for an mp to die before he could come back! if you are going to have local mps then there should at le assit be a residency requirement. i'd say minimum 5 years. without that then the party still decides.
aluckyaday,the prices at a book that can restrict can be different to one that can not. they can offer manymanymany more props. they can give recreational bettors free bets money back offers and my favorite best odds guaranteed. if the line moves against you you get the better price
joeytunes2,best way to go upon sportsbetting is to look at it by year n overtime daily. you cant have a chase mentality. nor week mentality. biggest mistake is the sunday night bail out. curb the demons acce point  a losing week. knowing  it is  n overtime going to last.
joeytunes2,"andy reid will come out ultra pr expected points added red

EdMillerPoker,i found  daily fantasy sports  to be an opportunity in early 2015 and then quickly transitioned from that into a full-time analytical/product development role in sports later that year so i've been doing sports full-time for about 4 years now. less bored than just found something new and exciting
EdMillerPoker,yeah. the other big issue is that most of the excitement surrounding sports betting is in a group of products that are very much n overtime ready for primetime yet (various in-game offerings). revenue = hold x volume and there's only so much volume you can get dealing pregame
EdMillerPoker,you're also seeing books getting way too far out over their skis offering markets they can't hope to price well and instead of putting effort into pricing them better or just n overtime offering them in the first place they just limit anyone who tries to beat those markets.
EdMillerPoker,also leagues should know that error rate in their data matters now. a 98 percent  feed is basically worthless but a 99.9 percent  feed can be worth $$$. if leagues can somehow force people to buy their 98 percent  data without improving it theyre really getting away with something.
GolcondaFund,you could also argue that at 6-11 hitting at a mere 35 percent  the real probability is they will improve to 40/45 percent  by bowl season end. especially considering early bowls feature teams most know too little about. should have faded you being 17 games late into a trend.
nonrandomalpha,dang stevie you have had some awful takes but this one is unquestionably  years old you are worst of 2019. just because race always matters in a material to you doesnt mean it does in everyone elses calculus.  years old you are inferiority complex is palpable. who hurt you?
nonrandomalpha,were then losing again 14-0 to eagles before another mel touchdown own. i'm n overtime saying the saints will be 6-10 but this team faded hard down the stretch and i expect the same to happen again in '19 exce point  this time will cause them to miss playoffs.
LeeSharpeNFL,i definitely think there's some of that. also if org leadership doesn't make it a priority then even individual actors within the org who do understand its value may find it n overtime worth pursuing due to limited resources. leadership buy-in is mandatory to make it work i think.
LeeSharpeNFL,one of the reasons i think the ravens do well is because what they're doing is very different so less of teams' pr expected points added rations against previous opponents transfers over. if that trend continues it makes sense (to me anyway) that manual charting insights would add value.
LeeSharpeNFL,oh i see. yeah the way it happened to play out was certainly n overtime good but going into the conference championship games if you asked me to rank the fo you are super bowl games by how much i wanted to see them ne/lar would have been last.
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is my current version yes though i may update later with some of the stuff he just posted.

there's certainly a l overtime of ben's code in mine and my code in his at this point. some day in the future we will form an nflscrapr hive mind."
AndyMSFW,at the moment almost all the game are non-conference.  there are a few leagues that have some scheduled early but for the most part conference play starts when the new year does.  once we get to january everything should be a conf. game until we start putting em brackets.
AndyMSFW,going to try to be a little more dog-content heavy going forward.  twitter analytics tell me that more of you like dogs than sports.  i would love the 1 percent  of you who  daily fantasy sports  like sports to say hi though; love to know what you're all about.
AndyMSFW,"almost forg overtime time to start cracking on my to-do list:
drink a julep
hit a trifecta
look at pretty girls in dresses
pet a real live horse
bet on a random track
mini doughnuts
catch a longshot
play blackjack
bet on a horse based on its name
#kentuckyderby"
AndyMSFW,i've g overtime couple rigs but today i just turned the kettle grill into an indirect heat cooker since these  daily fantasy sports  take all day.  plus then i'm able to spread the coals out and crisp the skin up at the end (and cook a ho touchdown og).
JoeyKnish22,if you go across the big 4 euro leagues they are the only team in that price range that even remotely has a realistic chance to make a run at the league. i really like a couple of the moves theyve made this offseason regardless of greizmann likely leaving.
JoeyKnish22,entire list will likely need a couple things to go right so ke point  it very low risk. he will likely need a injury to get enough minutes (but a zion injury is kind of correlated to him getting more minutes and opening up the roy award in general).
TheKostos,"i love this time on nfl sundays. listening to  and scooch on  my girl is making food while listening to christmas music. i'm putting in  daily fantasy sports  lineups and last-minute bets. some might refer to it as the calm before the storm!

(storm hits at 1pm et btw)"
TheKostos,"out of all the bullshit eli takes (including w/l record from people who usually bemoan qb winz as the stupidest thing ever) nothing is worse than ""he won two super bowls because of his defense."" 

keep those clown-ass takes out of my mentions and watch the games next time."
LockyLockerson,"phi-atl: nothing of note in the night game either for me make it phi -0.4 and  it is  -1.  nick loves atlanta (and pittsburgh) more than anything else this week so maybe i'll support the main host of the show and have a few bucks on the falcons.

fin/"
LockyLockerson,"cha point er 3: the nightcap

730p syracuse +28
730p florida state +7
8p ucla +23.5 (but you can probably get even better by waiting)
8p nebraska -14
1030p arizona +2

will probably have totals in the morning once i can confirm wind/weather and stuff and get some sleep."
LockyLockerson,"""florida has their conference opener against kentucky away next week classic sandwich game a free throw er the miami win super-flat""

florida won in a shutout 45-0 covering the pinnacle close of 44.5.  now ask yourself if they won 42-0 if you would really believe ""sandwich spot"" was why"
LockyLockerson,"2 charts:

first is an updated form of l assit week's.  these were heisman prices entering week 1 team total of the team opponent location and then what the price changed to a free throw er the game.  n overtime insane correlation but top and bottom pretty damn interesting."
DannyParkins,"that is my problem with what instant replay has become in a nutshell.

everyone says just get it right!

well did they get that right? mike peirera just disagreed with al riveron when everyone at home clearly sees the sp overtime was incorrect.

this doesnt make the game better."
DannyParkins,moreys tweet brought it to light but its n overtime like we didnt know china was communist or doing superemely messed up things and its n overtime like we didnt know the league and its players have massive economic interests tied into being popular in china. this isnt new.
DannyParkins,"if it wasnt for his talent level we would probably have a different view... of jordan kobe moss bonds and plenty of other all-time greats. 

rodgers isnt blameless but th against the spread the point. he has that talent level so youve gotta do everything possible to maximize him."
DannyParkins,in this case this is truly horrible advice unless coaching at alma mater is a dream job for bieniemy. theres no better apprenticeship towards being a head coach in the nfl than being andy reids oc. keep coaching mahomes and putting up numbers hell get a gig next year.
DannyParkins,welp i was wrong. wont be the l assit time (probably). lsu was the better team. worst game ive seen lawrence and terrell play. some brutal calls from pac-12 refs but it happens. clemson will be preseason number 1 and continue their dynasty making playoff every year its existed.
Gingfacekillah,"""the elements of statistical learning"" is a good starting textbook. ""who's #1?"" is a pretty beginner friendly book on team ratings also a decent place to start. it really depends on the individual level of understanding just pick one and start where you are.  that is  what i did."
Gingfacekillah,the market for people that actually want to do the work but dont have data science background is minuscule. it was rewarding to write a book that can give a handful of people a little boost in the right direction though. forgive me is chav like the scottish ned?
Gingfacekillah,"the other factor is that league revenues suffer if outcome of games is a foregone conclusion so we get:

- players play hard to preserve value but
- teams tank to get dra free throw  picks but
- league boosts tanking teams to ~0.250 with percent  to preserve revenues."
Gingfacekillah,using solver in excel or the equivalent in another program to determine the proper exponent for the method. so here cell p5=n5^q4. cell q4 is the exponent we are trying to find that makes the total probability for the fair odds of both sides equal 100 percent  (cell q7).
logan_matthews9,"two tournaments two playoffs. actually didnt catch the end of this as i turned it off when morikawa bogeyed 16 and steele was up two. quite the collapse from him. 

the matchups went much better this week lanto saved my t20s but crappy 3rd rounds from my outright picks"
logan_matthews9,very strong days from kuch fowler and wolff. morikawa battled back a free throw er a rough start. woodland with a meh day is nice for us. casey with a bad day is surprising. na with the worst performance of the bets i have unfortunately also my single biggest
logan_matthews9,1-0 with a fortunate push. 1 thing i saw: the lines tended to be above/below the book line throughout the game. this leads me to believe that theres an underlying number(s) that differs from the books and im assuming (possibly incorrectly) that its in how the teams are evaluated
PikachuBets,hey man  i do n overtime know  but all i know is since 2002 my team wins 69 percent  of the time against the spread  (69-31) on the road when their start time is before i take my shit while im on a free throw ernoon break at work
PikachuBets,lol. visit queens.  it is  the only county in the country to each rank in the top 5 of population pop. density and diversity. we're n overtime talking manhattan here. toronto is diverse but  it is  n overtime even close to being the most diverse place in north america
PikachuBets,quite an assum point ion you made of me too saying that i shouldnt be complaining about free picks. if you understand its about more than free/premium picks then say that. point about my attitude is very fair but ive just no patience at this point for tout bs
adamchernoff,"1-2 with the bets on the vsin segment this week.

n overtime counting the 5 winning teaser legs at the end of the clip as it is difficult to assume everyone listening can get them down. but hopefully it g overtime some listeners to even or ahead this week."
adamchernoff,"few hours to myself this week with the wife out and the nfl card loaded for sunday. catching up on the cma's from l assit week. great to see luke combs clean up. 

as good as his hits are i think this is his best. special song right here..."
adamchernoff,the most important thing i learned to think about was how teams are affected by their opponent. rather than thinking what can these teams do together to bet a total i think does this opponent increase or decrease the likelihood of success in the matchup. in order to do...
adamchernoff,initially it seemed that way but the line didnt budge off the news. was n overtime a surprise when announced but his impact on prices has been minimal the p assit 6-8 games dating back to l assit year. personally much more excited about henderson possibly getting an opportunity.
adamchernoff,wife and i both had a difficult time relating to people living there. most living there have a very different mindset attitude and pace of life compared to the part of the country where i grew up. found the city claustrophobic and generally filthy. just n overtime for us.
adamchernoff,you mean that the league is realizing having the refs who make a bad judgement call self review their initial judgement call to question whether their initial judgement was incorrect and if deemed so making them admit they have bad judgement to millions puts them in a bad spot?
adamchernoff,n overtime only will you (have a better chance at) find a more consistent edge and have a more clearly defined stake amount you'll also become better at reading how bookmakers manage their risk and be able to anticipate price movement. carrying out the exercise will also help with...
adamchernoff,mauro icardi n overtime being named to the squad is insanity. backline is a huge worry. sampaoli struggled to break down iceland/nigeria in 2018 now scaloni will face three equally compact/physical defences in the group stage. for me this team is a complete coin flip. 9/2 is too short.
Ccon8181,some things never change. #syracuse getting run as the sharp side verse #virginia .. coach boeheim letting his son jack up 3/12 and 1/8 from 3 haha. so glad its early in the season and dont have enough data so i didnt have to bsck that dumpster fire #syracuse
Ccon8181,reading the statement  and when effecting the outcome of the game the outcome wasnt in doubt for utah/duke..maybe i missed interpreted the rule but i appreciate you posting it. have also seen games with a foul call simultaneous with buzzer and ref waves off n runs off the court
Ccon8181,flashback to yesterday when todd  called out media outlets for n overtime using actual gamblers with real industry intel now hes cohosting an fs1 show with  who advised followers to get rich kids backing  #csu -17 who lost outright by 9 and were available at -14 a day prior
ToddFuhrman,appreciate the useful feedback don but you are correct. if you want shows with 10+ leans where personalities dont bet with an edge and teach you nothing about the process of being a long te winner then bet the board might n overtime be  years old you are style
ToddFuhrman,"i get into this argument all the time with people and rarely get a satisfactory answer...

when it comes to pay for play in college ive yet to see the most outspoken proponents provide a viable economic model proving it can work; once that surfaces serious discussions can start"
12Xpert,the reality is that the tax burden for everyone above median wage will have to rise to pay for this. if people want these things then it has to be paid for. endless borrowing is n overtime sustainable we've seen that. all politicians are being completely disingenuous about this.
12Xpert,"average yield colder = 0.77 percent 
average yield hotter = -2.77 percent 
average price colder = 3.88
average price hotter = 3.25

so  it is  possible a bit of the difference could still be due to residual favourite-longsh overtime bias if the log method doesn't fully account for it."
12Xpert,"i'll retweet this post as it is the most relevant amongst the posts in this thread that say a l overtime without saying anything at all. the thing that these ""artists"" are never able to tell you is how to tell the lucky one from the good (skilled) one."
12Xpert,affiliates who are also tipsters who advise bets they know in all likelihood will hold greater negative expectation to increase their rewards (e.g. accas and long odds) are in my view immoral but n overtime because gambling is immoral (if indeed it is) but because it verges on fraud.
12Xpert,...given that the eu had rebuffed him and it was obvious the nation was split down the middle about whether to continue with membership. presumably he'd also argue that the eu doesn't have a god-given right to continue to demand membership  that nations have a right to debate it
12Xpert,what's the point of talking about limitations if they then  daily fantasy sports  abide by them. here's an example. here's their shock and severe shock scenarios for sterling. presumably  that is  some kind of attem point  at error margin. so what actually happened was 5 percent  beyond severe shock.
12Xpert,(2/2). so suppose you ask for a price at betfair based on 'true' pinny price. some will get matched and some won't but i fear there will be a systematic bias in what does and doesn't get matched. it will be the pinny errors that will get disproportionately matched.

mschwimer,i have lots of thoughts and am extremely confident you will understand this. but twitter simply the worst platform. i have invited rufus to join my podcast. or i can join his. which ever he prefers. but its a fascinating convo. fyi. the gambling world unanimously agrees with rufus
mschwimer,we have far greater and much larger aspirations than a subscri point ion service. o you are service will only l assit a couple years at the most. the world will catch on and we will become the worldwide market setter in all major sports. then the fun begins!
mschwimer,yes. if we become the world wide market setter than o you are plan is done and we will discontinue o you are subscri point ion service. which is why i think o you are plan has a very small shelf life. maybe a couple years? but who knows.
RufusPeabody,"this is a generalization and it may be wrong but i think the ease of doing complex machine learning has made the new generation worse at predictive modeling.  it is  just ""plug it into a neural net"" now at the expense of critical thinking and problem solving ability."

SportsCheetah,that is  what the main takeaway was in the piece for me this week; there was an inordinate amount of games espn player projections were overestimating fantasy production. it started l assit week really but prior to w13 i would generally show ~2 games per week they were

RASPicks,whether or n overtime you believe in closing line value is irrelevant. the market currently doesn't value jambo's opinion at all. this despite the claim that they have hundreds of subscribers including many pro bettors (who presumably are n overtime betting anything on the picks). that isn't concerning?
RASPicks,someday there probably won't be a service but for now we are able to justify having one.  my point was that we have been successful for over 20 years in different markets subsets release times methods etc. despite many doubts from others.   we continue to evolve and improve.
suuma810,i g overtime +3 +101 i guess for a standard play. ive g overtime kc as the slightly better team. l assit two matchups came down to one possession  ne had a top-5 offense. sure foxboro is a different animal. still long time to go in this one.

spanky,thanks dave for revealing to the haters that it aint about me.  i earned the respect of the major players in this business n overtime from twitter but from busting my ass.  the people that matter know me and know the work i put into building my reputation.
spanky,when  first walked into  and asked what the betting limit was the supervisor replied there are no limits. soon a free throw er he was limited to 1k. limits are listed on every table game in a casino and should be required on every sport/bettype in the sportsbook
spanky,i have a new respect for   she is more than a pretty face.  while she herself recognizes shes n overtime a pro gambler she provides entertaining gambling content where any network will be lucky to have her. being a woman in a male dominated industry aint easy (4/7)
spanky,every interaction i have every book i read etc.. there are gems. some are more challenging to find than others but the quest for knowledge should never stop. dont be quick to discredit someone fully based on one or even several poor qualities especially if they are successful
spanky,offensive pi vs. defensive pi. block vs. offensive foul.  all are referees subjective calls that many times can go either way.  sh overtime a free throw er the buzzer is purely objective and despite being meaningless to game outcome should be made right 100 out of 100 times...
spanky,(1/2) this has been going on for years n overtime just by  but by all sportsbooks in vegas and offshore.  their justification is for protection against being hit multiple times at the same price. an easy solution would be an auto mover based on amount and player profile...

aluckyaday,you are missing the point of recreational betting. the value of the product is nothing to do with ev. it is the enjoyment they get from the chemical changes in their brain. how do you put a price on that other than what people are willing to pay?
aluckyaday,this is an issue though. these so free throw  books now operating in the us take the recreational money away from the traditional books. it makes it very hard for them to operate taking mainly sharp money. ultimately like europe the traditional books will become become dressmakers too.
aluckyaday,we have seen it all in europe already. the so free throw  book model has won. the traditional sharp books are all gone. either taken over or switched to the so free throw  book model themselves. maybe wrong but i expect the same to happen in the us.
aluckyaday,trying to think how i would do it. classification algorithm i would guess. but what are the classifications. profitable before costs a free throw er variable costs a free throw er their proportion of fixed cost plus variable costs. then what features would i use? then what algorithm?
aluckyaday,maybe. but most of their profits come from a small number of players and most of their losses the same. as long as the profiling cuts out the big winning players (mainly bots and syndicates) but allows the big losers to keep losing it won't be far off.
aluckyaday,i do have a vested interest. i want to see racing thrive. but at the moment it is beholden to the bookmakers. it is being held back by its funding model. what is best for bookmakers is n overtime best for racing but bookmakers are calling the shots.
aluckyaday,i would think they on dodgy ground legally unless they make it clear on the betslip that there are no bonuses. is hiding the change in their tc when the common perce point ion of a lucky is that it comes with bonuses fair under uk consumer law?
aluckyaday,it does. but you should also weight  years old you are bets based on edge. if you have an edge on all 4 then  years old you are maximum edge will be on the acca. kelly staking weights bets based on a combination of  likelyhood (price) and edge.
aluckyaday,by being the best in the business. in reality their can only be one true sharp price. in a global unrestricted sharp market any differences outside the margin will be arbed out. in a similar way to a stock that is traded on different exchanges around the world.
aluckyaday,backtested using my results at level returns on each part of the lucky. results using that staking method no bonuses total staked 17430 profit 1684.58 roi 9.66 percent . results using a lucky 15 with bonuses for the same total stake  stake 17430 profit 5848.88 roi 33.56 percent
aluckyaday,sbc. interestingly many moons ago before i was on twitter one of their premium tipsters was a member of the same private forum as me. he introduced pete to me with a view of them promoting my selections. i turned them down. probably much poorer for doing so
aluckyaday,good luck with that. in this game money wins. when books realize that a so free throw  book model is a much more profitable way to operate they have to switch or get swallowed up. that is why almost all european books are now so free throw .
aluckyaday,as  daily fantasy sports  have a constitution constitutional important issues are usually settled by precedent and the courts n overtime referendum. in the uk there has only ever been 3 national referendum. two on the eu and one on the voting system. certainly n overtime a regular occurrence.
aluckyaday,the us is only a small part of the global gambling market. it will n overtime contribute that much to worldwide liquidity. americans seem to think sports gambling does n overtime exist outside the us! you do know where to get a big bet down at the moment?
aluckyaday,"the v assit majority of recreational bettors  daily fantasy sports  work with a ""bankroll"". if you  daily fantasy sports  have any kind of bankroll management you can n overtime ""blow up  years old you are bank"". they also  daily fantasy sports  consistently back true 2.25 shots at 2.5!"
aluckyaday,human brains finds randomness very difficult to understand. there has to be a reason for everything. evolution did n overtime have sports betting in mind when this trait evolved. more staying alive in a predator infected world. that random pattern in the grass looks like a tiger. run!!!
aluckyaday,isn't that the idea behind most businesses? you are correct they are n overtime bookmakers in the traditional sense of the word though. they are an entertainment company chasing disposable income. the ceo of bwin put it well o you are main competitors are cinemas and bowling alleys.
EdMillerPoker,all this can change on a dime if a better product appears. there's no monopoly here.. quite the opposite. you're seeing the euro model dominant here in the early stages because those were the folks ready to go on day 1 n overtime because  it is  competitively superior.
nonrandomalpha,that is  a very generous descri point ion considering he bombed v clemson arguably the best defense he's come across even in spite of having elite nfl caliber athletes supporting him...i'm n overtime saying tua will suck but expectations should be tempered. he could be the next mariota...
nonrandomalpha,in a division with a healthier falcons and a fundamentally improved (at le assit better coached) bucs  it is  n overtime even that improbable. additionally saints had one of the best to differentials and the bucs the worst in '18. historical trend suggests both will regress to mean.
LeeSharpeNFL,looking at the standings this makes sense to me. of the bye-eligible teams no is the only one with 3 conference losses. losing this doesn't give them another one. so no isn't helped with a win here still needs other teams to lose for a bye either way.
LeeSharpeNFL,"week 17 games since 2008 between a team playing for a playoff berth and/or improved seeding vs. a team eliminated from the playoffs are 35-37-1 against the spread.

n overtime the largest sample but evidence is either the market is already adjusting to motivation or it doesn't matter."
LeeSharpeNFL,"through week 13 teams by number of qbs starting games:

1: ari bal buf cle dal gb hou lac lar  minutes ne oak phi sea sf tb (16)

2: atl car chi cin den ind jax kc mia no nyg ten (12)

3: det nyj pit was (4)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"hou leads division now at 7-4 ind behind at 6-5. they have split their two games.

hou remaining opponents:

ind remaining opponents:

looks like ten could decide the afc south but n overtime in the way they hoped."
whale_capper,these are good points but the qb owns the sack argument is so strong id expect turnovers and sacks are going to soar with jacoby at qb... 0-5 or 1-4 start looks imminent which makes dra free throw  positioning immediately come to mind during the week 6 bye
AndyMSFW,o you are guy  is physically at the track and i'm n overtime seeing any winners yet.  i sprayed a little on the 4 horse to hit the board in the first race because  it is  friday  it is  the breeders cup and  it is  dark liquor szn.
AndyMSFW,"i know i know... i'm getting around to it.
gonna add those two along with another price i like...

streelman t20 +150
taylor t20  +275
malnati t20 +400

taking slightly worse numbers at bovada in exchange to the fact that they  daily fantasy sports  apply dead heat rules."

JoeyKnish22,which one of  years old you are lame burner accounts scooped this from my tl? the gay rooster or the fat cow? how bout i charge you a commission to finally give a winner. you didnt even get the line right you fucking dope it was 54.5 everywhere.
JoeyKnish22,alright folks. heres the bowl pool signup link. very simple pick side and total for every game best records win (t5 get paid). spreads will be up thursday but you can signup now. once youre in dm   years old you are username and hell give you payment info
LockyLockerson,michigan may lose saturday but it won't be because of those nonsense harbaugh trends y'all are quoting.  like yeah...sorry he couldn't beat urban meyer #2 penn state on the road and #5 wisconsin on the road 2 seasons ago.  what a loser.  can't believe he couldn't beat them.
LockyLockerson,"on l assit night's show i talked about tonight's games.  the synopsis from l assit night:

i have a miami +7 ticket already i feel ok but n overtime great about it.

i also played florida's tt u27 

in the 2nd game (arizona-hawaii) i currently have no bets."
LockyLockerson,good news is theyll have the benefit of fewer tough games because of conference and their stat profile has a chance to get crazy inflated because of competition which means overvalued. bad news is their seed usually maxes out lower than big teams. a fun story to follow.
DannyParkins,i just dont do press conference rage like so many seem to love in football. they all lie. good coaches and gms from winning organizations. bad coaches and gms from losing ones. what they say doesnt matter. its a salary capped sport with deadlines. judge the bears actions.
DannyParkins,if you or someone you know is an old school scorehead check out this treasure trove of old audio classics that havent aired  in 15+ years that we unveiled over the final ho you are today. so many laughs and classics in here plus a new wanny gem.
DannyParkins,n overtime at all i watched some of montgomery and reid a free throw er the pick. my point is  it is  n overtime something that the v assit majority of fans/media know about or do plus theres no expertise and 100's of other factors with the picks.
DannyParkins,this is the most painful way to lose out on machado for the white sox. it seems like they lost out because of a monetary technicality and to a franchise  that is  on their tier. they weren't blown out of the water financially by the yankees. this sucks.
Gingfacekillah,no although perhaps there is value there - i haven't checked. what i mean is value on certain single bets o free throw en has a correlation to value on another single bet if you can find some determinative link. i recommend doing some work to explore this.
Gingfacekillah,obviously someone just looked at the l assit game and decided history will repeat itself. pace looks about right i'm forecasting a game pace of 99-101.  daily fantasy sports  see  minutes or det breaking 110 og though which theoretically puts the game below 223 more times than not.
Gingfacekillah,i think shin probabilities would be of particular interest to soccer (football) 3 way bettors. the journals i read l assit night concluded that for 2 way bets several methods approximating  years old you are logarithmic method is superior. shin method developed for horses best for 3+ outcomes.
Gingfacekillah,"i calculate the variance for each bet as (1^2*(decimal odds -1)). then i sum this variance for all bets. next find the sq of this variance to find the s touchdown . dev. then i take:

((total profit/dollars per unit)/ standard deviation) = z score.

finally: 1-normsdist(z score)"
Gingfacekillah,early total test results potentially promising. system rsq: 18.43 percent  vs closing line rsq of 16.44 percent . lower standard error as well. in-sample win rate of 59.09 percent  but n overtime holding my breath. expect it to fall with larger out of sample tests. #handicapping #sharpaction #sportsbetting
logan_matthews9,"neither being a good dude nor a hard worker is relevant to the conversation

no one is questioning his character. but the reality is he almost certainly using bad lines to self promote a winning percentage that doesnt exist

also the bets literally every game line is iffy..."
logan_matthews9,"lanto: talked about him l assit week but on him now. very consistent in the winds l assit time out im buying. 

percy: one of the better second shots in the tournament. weird combo of 128th in drive accuracy but 36th in gir percentage. that works this week"
logan_matthews9,just to follow up on dj: a much better ball striking round just couldnt make a putt besides the 41 footer for eagle. 1.93 average putts per gir. hard to go low with that number. had an issue with the shots 70 to set up make-able birdie putts.
logan_matthews9,"market update starting with matchups:

almost all positive movements.  best of luck took reavie to +165 but hes +140/+155 elsewhere. casey went to +105 even though the reed line moved against woodland. i believe everything is positive n overtime sure id take anything that moved besides na -110"
logan_matthews9,because of the massive amount of plays a bad week like they had makes this almost unsustainable for  years old you are average bettor. if  years old you are bankroll was $10000 for example - you couldnt get down all the recommendations for the rest of the month
logan_matthews9,this is undeniably false. the work that jk did from a ussf development standpoint is massive. his work in establishing the das restructuring coaching ed making a more efficient  effective pathway etc - ill argue hes done more for the future of us soccer than any other person
PikachuBets,"i said that stanford has worth over state schools for this reason exactly and then you started with the irrelevant stuff ""school gets you interview but you have to smart blah blah."" i'm telling you  that is  n overtime the case. squeeze into elite school schmooze network profit."
PikachuBets,/4 yes they should know better. yes they shouldn't be so gullible. no that doesn't mean we should sit idly when someone like berry explodes onto the scene. it doesn't mean we allow a guy to mislead/fudge public records to garner attention  do pr blitzes. no. fuck that.
PikachuBets,"they're n overtime that ""different"" just stale. european books  daily fantasy sports  get much handle with baseball or college sports so the way they handle those lines are just plan weird and they  daily fantasy sports  give a shit. much more concerned about live soccer arbs/props and such."
PikachuBets,of course transparency fucking helps people's bankrollsyou simpleton. if i am transparent about losing this season with unimpressive closing line value then people can use that info to decide whether to play my plays or not. if i am transparent that my results aren't great that is valuable.

adamchernoff,n overtime sure if it was mentioned but r overtime numbers were created for casinos to speed up transactions at tellers and also for ease of training. in my experience its difficult to expect entry level tellers to know 500+ teams interpret bettors requests and create tickets quickly.
adamchernoff,should think about handicapping the game six different times with each team playing the majority in a specific game state. why this total is interesting is because hou despite likely having a lead changes their play calling balance less than any team in the nfl (3 percent  diff)...
adamchernoff,furthermore consensus reports lump everything into one category. for example on  monday night football  the lions moved from +6.5 to +3. there are eight buy points in that range. representing the entire market with one single percentage does n overtime make sense. without knowing the exact liability at..
adamchernoff,"nfl week 2 is interesting because we have a couple key pieces of info that tell us a l overtime about which teams bookmakers are bumping up and down in price point as well as which performances and over reactions the betting market is buying and selling.

listen:"
adamchernoff,n overtime go directly from the account api on the book side. this means you may run the risk of frequently having bets false confirmed. prices are never guaranteed either because of the delay. ive yet to see a commercial brokerage or aggregator be reliable enough to use.
adamchernoff,absolutely assuming you get matched. when i stopped trading i was scalping point by point at 40-0 and 40-15. atp will move 2-3 ticks per point wta will move 3-4. if the price is available and youre first in queue it will match in less than 1 second.
adamchernoff,"loaded podc assit this morning. i think it is the best i have done this season.

ToddFuhrman,joeys sp overtime on here. reduced juice only caters to the kind of customer most books dont want to do business with long term. eventually youll see an operator come into the space embracing that kind of bettor and collect margins on volume but hasnt happened stateside yet.
ToddFuhrman,i respect that completely; bettors always discuss market inefficiency that inevitably exists with more teams but most folks are limited by the amount of time they have to effectively know 100's of teams in  college football / college basketball  if  it is  n overtime their full time pursuit
ToddFuhrman,"the way i read this...

""we encourage all of o you are new potential sponsors to take o you are fans money through slots and table games but may the wrath of hell be unleashed upon you with fire and brimstone if you acknowledge sports betting even exists"""
12Xpert,if the argument that bookmakers want to fleece addicts for their shirt is valid (questionable but go with it here) then it would stand to reason that they would make every effort n overtime to restrict customers by mistake in the hope the will bag players like this.
12Xpert,that was betfair exchange so basically no costs or insider trading to worry about. racing has too many runners too many variables too much variance and uncertainty and hence too much potential for inefficiency and risk for a sharp bookmaker to make work in a high tax regime.
12Xpert,"what is less acce point able is the denial by bookmakers that they restrict ""winners"". of course they allow people to win (via luck) but a little bit of explaining what expected value is would deal with shameful defence. rather recreational books should just admit they do it."
12Xpert,it will have been a tweet and i would guess it would have been to show that betfair racing starting prices would be efficient. you're probably thinking of the bookmaker favourite-longsh overtime bias which ensure punters have a much smaller  percent  loss at shorter odds than longer odds.
12Xpert,my attem point  at a premiership heat map.  daily fantasy sports  know if  it is  any good. measures over/under performance relative to market expectation as defined by closing  1x2 odds. score is cumulative for the season. -1 through to -6 are cumulative scores -1 -2 etc matches before.
12Xpert,if you're a freshman reading this for god's sake  daily fantasy sports  be persuaded by the crazy win percentages. they aren't possible.  daily fantasy sports  ever imagine they are. 57 percent  is about the best for their markets. this tells you all you need to know about why:
12Xpert,as in financial markets a free throw er costs are taken into account the whole exercise of professional advice is one of coin tossing (on average). can you tell me if the difference between expected and pre cost pre slippage actual profit is significant. has implications for clvh.
12Xpert,"cite lack of evidence (that savvy customers are routinely restricted) as reason why they ruled in favo you are of  concerning a complaint about their "" daily fantasy sports  bet silly bet savvy"" advert. the evidence will be there  easy to collect should  be required to release it."
12Xpert,that is  certainly true. but if in the end neither of them are as good as the pinny implied predictions at market closure what's the point of them? no goo for making money. what else might they be good for? page filler for  certainly. is there anything else?
12Xpert,"the elimination of squares is a thought experiment that is all.
you just want this to be true. you haven't presented any data to back up ""single figure number"". skybet quote 4 percent  as being restricted. this picture suggests  it is  very likely smaller at a sharp book."
12Xpert,"i'm guessing that this is because the monte carlo and  calculator uses the same odds for every bet but the actual ""record"" had much more variable odds. ""record"" is shown in quotes because we're n overtime really talking about a record here are we really just a pattern"

mschwimer,they are their own people. they know im a big boy.  i dont need them to come to my defense. martin did. he didnt need to do that. he is a legit pro that owns a so free throw ware company that sets lines. he tweeted a lot.
mschwimer,this has nothing to do with being on either side of the bet. i had no action at all on either side. its about doing the right thing vs. doing the easy thing. vegas books do it the easy way. nj books do it the right way imo
mschwimer,"correct for vegas books. nj books are different. fanduel graded the over and the cardinals as winners. it is in their rules. google fanduel baseball betting rules and you will see. 

really needs to be an industry standard on this and fanduel is by far the most logical."
mschwimer,then  years old you are book is a joke. score is 4-4. it cant be a loss.  im hearing from multiple people that suspended play in this situation means the action carries over. meaning the over is a win and we will see how the game plays out.
RufusPeabody,"to be clear if you have an edge on each leg of the parlay then this is n overtime true. 

but youre typically paying a premium taking big faves on the ml.

RufusPeabody,i'm n overtime any sort of expert on this but it does seem like if you were working in concert with someone else and could create 300 unique lineups (instead of 150) in a contest with a small slate (4 games) that would be an unfair advantage.

SportsCheetah,you just say something to the tune of i decided it gave us the best chance to win the division taking the tie in that spot. he's still undefeated this season there hard to hate on that imo. cardinals next week at home as big fave etc.
SportsCheetah,i'm n overtime a doctor i  daily fantasy sports  really know. tend to think  it is  more physically and mentally taxing though. they're a jokic 4-6 week injury from being lock under (let alone missing more time than that). seems like 80+ games again is an underdog.
SportsCheetah,either way the point stands. luke ran with corral for nearly 2 quarters for 0 points when plumlee is the one that has scored their 3  touchdown s. then doubled-down on the 4th down wide-open  touchdown  and corral overthrows him. luke just overthinking things the entire game.
SportsCheetah,i tried to convince myself of this too but duffey has been really bad when he g overtime run in the past. and the other o point ion is a rice transfer. it certainly was concerning though that bowman could only muster 14 against that zona d.

spanky,ive never met a bettor who bets to lose.  every bettor i have ever met thinks they are good enough or are close to being good enough to make a side income off of betting.  they may be dillusional but it doesnt change the perce point ion.
spanky,i also think the paper lacked specifics on the distribution of where the best moneyline was placed. if the majority of the bets were placed at jerrys nugget it doesnt tell us anything on how the market is inefficient but rather how jerrys nugget moneylines are inefficient.
spanky,"good stuff adam.

PlusEVAnalytics,sl overtime aps: seems like each reel is drawn independently from a uniform distribution is taken as acce point ed fact why does it have to be this way? i dont think theres an applicable law like there is for video card games in nv is there?
aluckyaday,i believe will also restrict you if you take prices that can be arbed at the time you take them even if you  daily fantasy sports  ultimately beat the close. a couple of data protection requests for trader notes on accounts i've had closed said as much.
aluckyaday,these system will stop  years old you are normal user from betting out of state. but they won't stop someone who is determined to get around them. they are used more to satisfy the regulators rather than to actually stop someone who wants to get around them.
aluckyaday,why? whether a refund is made is at the bookmakers discretion on a case by case basis. the client does n overtime have a right to it and should n overtime expect it. it is done as a good will gesture. those that get it are happy.
aluckyaday,this is actually why i use the 2 measure. one looks at the closing price to see if i am beating it. the other looks at the chance of me getting a return if no edge exist in the price i took. that covers both above scenarios
aluckyaday,i do think at some point a compromise will be reached. if it were me i'd implement a two level reduction factor. one for more efficient markets and one for recreational ones. allowing recreational sharps to stake more on the efficient markets. can i patent that please
aluckyaday,ideal 3 versions of the above. 1 using  years old you are model probability as the true probability. 2 using pinnacles closing price less vig as the true probability. 3. using  years old you are model probability regressed to pinnacles closing less vig as the true probability.
aluckyaday,but i can buy a 5000 bottle of wine in a restaurant.  it is  n overtime the absolute amount that is the issue but affordability combined with the genetic or psychological dispositions of the gambler. some people lose 5000 on a single bet some over 1 million!
aluckyaday,exchanges have their advantages but there also disadvantages. they do n overtime appeal to recreational punters and there are regulatory issues. two of the main exchanges betfair and be touchdown aq have both had to resort to running a so free throw  sportsbook to make ends meet.
aluckyaday,"i think he is being a little economical with the truth there. he has also said if one of their ""consultants"" (love that term) is beating their sports model consistently they put an awful l overtime of effort in to finding out how they are doing it!"
aluckyaday,how can you say it does n overtime benefit the voters when the value of  years old you are vote under a first p assit the post system depends entirely on where you live. in what version of democracy are some people's votes more important than others?

EdMillerPoker,its certainly the case that if you try to bet error lines into a delay  years old you are rejection rate will be much greater than normal. how they determine the error (from betting action or just finding it themselves) is hard to tell from the outside.
EdMillerPoker,more generally a huge thing to be aware of is phantom bets/lines. there's a huge difference between seeing a line and price quoted on a website or in an article or on a betting app and actually being able to get real money down on that line/price.
EdMillerPoker,for me what seems like a common thread among great leaders at le assit that i know about is a constant respect and proper valuation of the resources at their disposal. i think treating people at le assit fairly o free throw en comes out of that.
EdMillerPoker,no phone for a week as punishment for n overtime doing homework/n overtime cleaning room/staying out too late/talking back or whatever other shit teens do undermines trust (i think part of what original tweet was getting at) and imo doesnt serve short or long term parenting goals

DannyParkins,poor. i dont want to know how much money im down lifetime. however oddly enough that habit that had been purely an entertainment expense i was happy to pay now is starting to pay off given legalized sports gambling and the content and career opportunities it provides.
DannyParkins,"17 of the top 18 passing yards leaders had played either 11 or 12 games coming into today.

DannyParkins,my takeaway from yesterday is simple:  it is  over. both the playoff hopes of this year and the trubisky-nagy partnership long term. nagy sounds so ridiculous defending the indefensible because he can't say the truth: he doesn't trust mitch. he'll have a new qb next year. #bears
DannyParkins,l assit thing from me and then ill tap out and let my kc follower count dip. its true innocent people plead guilty all the time. its true police reports shouldnt be taken as fact. but heres the relevant 2014 report detailing the physical injuries as observed.
DannyParkins,you guys are comfortable saying that someone who plead guilty to punching and strangling his pregnant girlfriend and then was caught on tape saying you should be terrified of me too bitch didnt do *anything* wrong? how about those words? th against the spread n overtime wrong?
DannyParkins,do you know he didnt? its possible he did possible he didnt right? so when the cubs and nbc release a statement to all media you suggest ignoring it instead of learning about what it means in worst cases? also done on camera behind a minority matters.
DannyParkins,we were critical of that press conference that day and again today. aaron is n overtime interested in a conversation about something important but instead resorts to name calling and no specifics. but everyone should know no one hates dv more than aaron. hes the most mad.

Gingfacekillah,surprised me a bit too. most of the recreational books were in a similar range. im speculating but i think the outlier price at the rec books might be indicative of them simply managing their respective risk given that their clientele would disproportionately be on the fav?

12Xpert,it might seem unrigorous to me and you but these brands particularly those answerable to shareholders are in the business of maximising profit. hence they will run a tight ship and do things properly. if traders were found to be making poor decisions well what would happen?
12Xpert,from whom do bookmakers collected their change? and exchanges? i wouldn't exist if they didn't exist. presumably that make's them even lower than the lowest of the low. you should think a little more clearly about  years old you are position on gambling before firing off insults.
12Xpert,brilliant. citizen kane  blocked me for asking him to define soon in this reply to my tweet about impending eu recession. he asked why he should define it and i said because i asked him to and that without a timescale its easy to claim predictive success.
12Xpert,that might also be the case. which was the point of my initial retweet. there are those (at the guardian and amongst the current labo you are party in particular) who view gambling as a moral evil in all forms and are waging a war against it.
12Xpert,if i'm using different figures it will be because you've changed them. i'm just reporting what i see on  years old you are header page that you link to in  years old you are twitter account. never a good sign if you change those things without explanation.
12Xpert,when asking why we do things i think you always have to start by taking the evolutionary perspective: why does a behavio you are exist? most likely  it is  a winning strategy otherwise it would have already died out. what about it made it a winning strategy?
12Xpert,"whether they were voting for a good idea is a different argument but that is n overtime the one that remainers typically use when talking about the need for a second referendum.  it is  the ""you didn't know what brexit you were voting for"" that is used."
12Xpert,good for you for staying strong. all of us suffer mental disorders in different ways including saying stupid things on tv to garner attention. but lets celebrate the debate that springs from different opinions and recognise that people have reasons for why they say what they say
12Xpert,oh this firm has no morality at all. they ruined the business of many affiliates who spent years promoting their brand in the space of 4 weeks claiming bad affiliates presented too much liability but still continue to work with the very worst of those affiliates today..
12Xpert,"i've probably confused the issue by using ""blind"" instead of ""blanket"" i.e. bet all available odds (level stakes). yes if you bet everything to level stakes you are likely going to lose unless  years old you are longer prices get lucky. or are you asking something different?"

mschwimer,but the fund has been incredibly successful. first fund was $26m and took 8 months. second fund raised $182 in 5 weeks. when you are successful people want to invest more. its how life works. knock on wood i have yet to do anything in business unsucessfully.
mschwimer,so when you said you would sign up to fade if we didnt have  college basketball . then i gave you a 4 week package and gave you odds. did you actually mean you wouldnt at all and you dont mean a word of what you say?
mschwimer,fans should hold owners accountable. the profits they are making are skyrocketing. if a bad signing happens that should be a problem for the owners wallet. n overtime the fans. fans should always ro overtime for getting the best players. money shouldnt factor in at all. 2/2

PlusEVAnalytics,im a situational bettor says stewart. im looking for underdogs that can win outright. the algorithm-based handicappers dont make those bets because the math says that those teams dont have a chance to win. stewart uses trends and data at her disposal to choose her spots
aluckyaday,there are some sharp bookmakers out there but they serve a niche market. modern mass market recreational bookmaking is n overtime about catering for sharp punters. its about maximising profits from recreational players. the business case for n overtime booking sharps is a very strong one....
aluckyaday,it is quite interesting if they have only limited you on basketball. normally restrictions are applied across the board. if they have so free throw ware that allows different reduction factors for different sports its quite new. maybe testing with neds before rolling out across gvc?
aluckyaday,their is a public bias for leave but the modelers say remain has the + expected value . bookmaker boris is taking advantage of the public bias. will his plan succeed  or will the sharps with their limit bets force him to move the line back?

nonrandomalpha,they also provide a l overtime of free content most of which (certainly n overtime all) is both entertaining and valuable to both novice and professional bettors. if you want to buy picks on the cheap i suspect  is one of the better o point ions...
nonrandomalpha,leaf and russell comparison are egregious n overtime only for performance but for personality. leaf and russell struggled but it was their toxic presences that g overtime them kicked out of the league. tru has a great attitude even if he is a work in progress.
nonrandomalpha,a deeper dive into jackson's st against the spread demonstrate he was far far more potent with fitz and much less so with winston. chemistry with qb is critical and a wr's efficacy can drop off significantly over a single offseason when in jackson's age demo
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  funny to me that the first playoff game is going to be between two teams with a combined probability of under 2 percent  to win the super bowl according to my model but this will in no way stop us all from watching it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"attem points  is also a volume stat. ideally you'd use expected points added/dropback but even something like yards/attem point  is much better than looking just yards or just attem points .

(also ""momentum"" isn't predictive of anything and the success of passing doesn't depend on running.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah they say it comes from seeing favorites win playoffs games by more than expectation. i do wonder how much of that is ""splits happen"" i'm generally wary of narratives that playoff games are different from regular season games. (but i should probably examine my priors.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,and aside from the error bars being large and overlapping this only analyzes rbs *as they affect the run game* (because  it is  from the big data bowl) but most analytical attem points  to rank rbs are looking at their impact to the passing game primarily.
LeeSharpeNFL,"buf has an interesting remaining schedule of both easy interesting and hard games.

in general my model expects more variance the market though i think there may be overcorrection in team ratings for it from stuff in the early weeks? this has been a bizarre season."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my teammates and i are 18-25-2 currently in the supercontest. o you are picks for week 10:

AndyMSFW,things are opening just took ravens/chiefs over 52.5 -110.  competitive game will keep the kc offense humming and i think lamar will do just that against this d.  also i can't imagine n overtime cheering for points in the most fun game of the young season.
AndyMSFW,i guess i mean in terms of success.  have you found  years old you are implied edges have done better on mid-tourney positions like this (maybe when the market hasn't adjusted enough which would seem to be the case here) compared to taking a pre-tourney price

JoeyKnish22,if my dad was here hed tell you to ignore  years old you are kids as much as humanely possible while theyre growing up so you can focus on more gambling. then one day when theyre old enough youll be gambling together. i turned out fine.
TheKostos,i'm sorry i'm still stuck on the clapper saying he had cooper and cobb out for the 4th down play because they needed rest. lol.  it is  4th and (maybe) the season!! why are you paying these guys if they can't perform in the big moments????
TheKostos,it was violent and disturbing. and as good as orton was (he was great) edge was better. i  daily fantasy sports  think  it is  possible to be better than edge just was. a real credit to him a free throw er all the time missed #raw
TheKostos,i can't get p assit people verbalizing/tweeting confirmation about shit that isn't actually confirmed and passing it off as news.  it is  one thing when  it is  about bullshit like a player signing etc entirely different when  it is  life and death particularly with children involved
DannyParkins,who said hes the greatest ever as  years old you are quote suggests? hes the greatest running qb ever statistically. hes the mvp this year. his passing has improved dramatically from year 1 to 2 and hes younger than joe burrow. why cant he keep improving?
DannyParkins,sean payton is gonna win this challenge. the bears running game is so broken they have to result to tosses to anthony miller with david montgomery as the lead blocker. blame nagy if you want but they dont have the personnel to run the ball traditionally.
DannyParkins,im with les on n overtime bus tossing and i dont think it was  years old you are fault obviously it was just  years old you are reaction that combined sheer panic with an immediate acknowledgment you werent gonna solve the problem that just killed me.
DannyParkins,ok the reactions to this tweet are hilarious. spiegs is an emotional baseball romantic who very easily could have been crying about feeling overwhelmed. but what youre seeing in this picture is embarrassment upon hearing he called runners dead when they made outs on the bases.
chadmillman,"great detail from  in his prez cup wrap-up. but i want to know more about what this entails. for next time. 

""(tiger) wanted to be a ca point ain; he wanted to ride in a cart and wear an earpiece and offer advice and configure pairings."""
Gingfacekillah,may 1st for sure my goal is to have it out on or before april 1st though. i've been buried under a pile of legal research memos the l assit two weeks. will have some time this coming week to get a substantial amount written :)
Gingfacekillah,poll: we observe a random population of 15000000 sports bettors. analogously using price's law we might guess that the square ro overtime of the population is producing 50 percent  of the results giving us ~3873 bettors producing 50 percent . how would you assess that estimate?
Gingfacekillah,i started sports modelling exclusively in excel and ran with it for 4 years. just stepped up to r stan and python but the learning curve was helped considerably by advanced excel skills. understanding the logic of the excel commands gives you a nice head start.
Gingfacekillah,"""it is amazing how the more time spent on accurately pricing a game to  sp overtime inefficiencies the more of an a free throw erthought bankroll management  becomes.""

that is absolutely true. finding the inefficiencies is the part you want to work the hardest at imo."
logan_matthews9,if a tout is bad at first they dont go anywhere and never get off the ground. those who get the right side of variance think theyve cracked the code flaunt their record and then go on the other side once everyone has loaded up financially
logan_matthews9,another issue: kc will occasionally have massive bet percentages. i would never bet 10+ percent  of my bankroll on anything but that happens multiple times here. i could/probably shouldve set a cap but this was a more general test to see if the model was working
PikachuBets,"id rather keep  years old you are business and limit you to only betting one side of props! wow what a great missed opportunity let me jump on in!!!

adamchernoff,browns backed into success with an accidental game play against the ravens. they may ultimately end up getting forced into the right game plan this week by ne. variance here hinges on mayfield. the -13 looks both awfully short and too much at the same time.
adamchernoff,sounds fantastic. i tried the bath yesterday. before wrapping i put butter honey pineapple and some rub into the magic bullet then poured it on. found it worked quite well. no stick/burn like sometimes happens with butter/sugar in the wrap if the temp creeps above 300.
adamchernoff,if i knew haskins was going to come in and their best wide receiver was going to blow his hamstring in practice two days a free throw er i bet i probably would n overtime have bet either haha. but  that is  how it goes sometimes.
adamchernoff,see all of canada for that evidence. canadians made up $4b of the $65b revenue for bet365 (alone) meanwhile the sports lotto product across the country generated $500m due to - single operator pricing sides/totals to 116 percent  and paying parlays at 75 percent  true odds.
adamchernoff,i imagine with a week they can fix grass especially with the nfl money. however soccer turf is different from nfl. if they did this to wembley (despite all the money in that stadium) i imagine patchwork grass in mexico gets beat up bad too regardless.

ToddFuhrman,well here's the issue that i always have...vegas power numbers are based on predictive and proactive numbers whereas the media polls are all about results and n overtime indicative of future success ( that is  about as deep as i can get on a saturday btw)
ToddFuhrman,books  daily fantasy sports  want the exposure; no benefit to them.  in this kind of situation arrangements have to be made meaning they reap media impressions/pr benefits.  if a common man or pro bettor tried to move a fraction of this he wouldn't have a chance
ToddFuhrman,"i see why some coaches consistently take the ""safe"" approach with old school thinking...the amount of people that judge the effectiveness of a decision purely by  it is  outcome  daily fantasy sports  understand the math and probability behind making what is the smart choice long term"
ToddFuhrman,nope im right there with you as part of the concern. i dont think people realize exactly what giving kids cold hard cash at that age could do...i know id have gone off the rails. feel like we have enough precautionary tales with nba rookies too
12Xpert,both would have serious cascading consequences which would also have to be modelled. given that things in nature typically follow the path of le assit resistance then one significant consequence would be a flight of business and capital to cheaper places. but paul can model it.
12Xpert,(1/2) whilst we're on the topic of luck and skill i've ran a little monte carlo sim comparing two bettors betting even-money 1000 times with 1 percent  stakes (1/2 kelly). first has margin expectation of -2 percent  the second has skill expectation of +2 percent .
12Xpert,i spent 14 years verifying tipsters. 120 of them came to me with previous records many of those had been published elsewhere with other services like blogabet or bettingadvice. in aggregate they had done 17 percent  from 24k tips. their next 90k did 1 percent .
12Xpert,that way people would have an answer about  years old you are skill level much sooner. unfortunately they'd also have an answer to the question of whether they will get their so free throw book betting accounts closed if they back  years old you are tips.
12Xpert,their way of doing politics is globalist: wisdom of the educated elites rather than wisdom of the dumb peasants. hasn't taleb taught us that globalist politics works fine until  it is  shocked by black swans at which point its fragility is exposed and lives are wrecked.
12Xpert,until i'm shown a large sample of bettors/tipsters that replicate what we see here i'm n overtime going to change my bayesian prior about  efficiency. yours might be a special case for reasons that have been previously highlighted. samples of one  daily fantasy sports  prove rules.
12Xpert,"i'll happily agree with that criticism and  years old you are interpretation of what's happening. i use ""winners v losers"" really as a metaphorical simplification. this was from my l assit book maybe  it is  closer to what you are talking about (hope  it is  readable)."
12Xpert,i'm n overtime saying  it is  impossible i'm saying  it is  very hard and harder than most people believe which is how this conversation started. most bettors are kidding themselves. overconfidence is how betting becomes rationale in the first place. otherwise no one would do it.
mschwimer,which is why we time stamp all o you are picks and dont line shop. we only use betcris/bookmaker line at time of release. so if you line shopped you would be able to get better lines than what we post in the majority of cases.
mschwimer,only a couple. and very small amounts. these are all academics. basically no experience in the sports betting world. some worked in sports. others pure acedemics. all they know how to do is predict outcomes of games. they know very little about the sports betting world.
mschwimer,at  we have far more people in nj than vegas. in nj more than 80 percent  of dollars bet on the game didnt follow vegas rules.  also i guess its how you define industry standard in the us.  by industry standard do you mean only vegas?
mschwimer,we get all o you are lines from . all o you are picks are time stamped and we reference the book that had the line. the only way we would ever put in a bad line is if  published one. i will look into it.
mschwimer,for all  subscribers. we posted a line for the vermont game at +10.5 from dra free throw kings. we have since found a bug in don best and dra free throw kings so we revised the line to +9. it is still a play on vermont.
RufusPeabody,"(4) clemson loses! (clemson loss prob 2.4 percent )
if all other faves win...
ou 88 percent 
utah 84 percent 
clemson 15 percent 
georgia 12 percent 

overall clemson has a 20 percent  sh overtime if they lose. obviously if other favorites lose that helps them."
RufusPeabody,the tout industry will always be a scourge on the betting ecosystem. but i would like to try to move the needle towards more transparency. if more touts essentially bet on themselves winning i'd hope it would increase pressure on other's to do the same.
RufusPeabody,hypothetical: if a bettor decided to publicly release picks for free to everyone would it be ok for them to include their betting history prior to publicly releasing picks in their official record (provided it was independently audited by a top 10 accounting firm)? discuss.
RufusPeabody,"n overtime sure if there's any rhyme or reason to this but the hold  percent  for  u.s. open tournament matchups fluctuates wildly from one offering to another:

mcilroy -233/spieth +180 (5.4 percent  hold)"
SportsCheetah,only because  it is  a 10:30pm island game aka small likely negative expected value proposition... but utep getting 2.5 now is a tad extreme imo.  let us  go miners. also the over because a wise man once said life's too short to bet the under.
SportsCheetah,"the hornets 126-125 win over the bulls will probably be one of the bigger discr expected points added ncies we see this season.

capjack2000,"cant say im surprised we see it time and again. kambi will tell you the book sets how much margin they want. 

im guessing kambi suggests (scares) books into choosing the highest margin on their weekly calls. then the public backlash forces books to normalize."

capjack2000,betsperts does n overtime have a license to operate a revshare in nj or pa based on my search. cpa likely. also if they are advertising any offshore books next to their dra free throw kings advertising they will be in violation of nj law.
capjack2000,"there's hope for the american style of bookmaking. while the big corporate machines are steamrolling across o you are map there's still some willing to stand up and say ""come on in and gamble with us."" 

support this effort.

   and  years old you are team."
capjack2000,in this situation a legal nj sportsbook could identify a winning sports bettor and then severely limit their account. forcing the player to find an alternative method to get money down. if that player uses a friend's account to wager. the sportsbook freerolls them. 5/9
capjack2000,"if you're n overtime already up and running in nj i wouldn't recommend exploring a fresh start there. will be over-saturated soon.

look to tennessee. use a vols color scheme.

capjack2000,good point. also worth noting that pointsbet is now a publicly traded company and quarterly reports matter.  it is  very tough for a book to turn a profit in the slow summer months. this could be a way for them to better shape their numbers.
capjack2000,"its easy to fall into hyperbole on twitter but this is unprecedented in its egregiousness. 

theyre attem point ing to solve a problem of unfair market advantage by creating an unfair market advantage that they profit from. books can buy that feed bettors can not."
robpizzola,let us  stop acting like he won those super bowls. his offense scored 38 points combined... those wins were largely on the defense. yes he made some great throws and plays (manningham down the sideline escaping sack for tyree pass) but he was merely average.
robpizzola,that was obviously a breakdown in coverage but the vikings only have themselves to blame for n overtime throwing downfield earlier in the game. played for a  field goal  right before half with three timeouts as well. super conservative game plan against russ is -ev.
robpizzola,"the key to halloween is the two bowl system.

suuma810,my favorite scenario: they trade down a couple of picks and take someone who helps sam darnold which is the number one priority. grab the best tackle on the board. use the extra dra free throw  capital to throw darts at the deep edge/wr class.
suuma810,i think they will be improved despite losing mack. upgraded at cb lb dt  irvin going full-time de. and more importantly a big upgrade at dc. expecting a completely different defense even if that might just be going from bottom-3 to somewhere around below average.
ClevTA,tough to say. he treated osu like a pro program so this isnt a major transition like a normal  college football  coach but he hates analytics and im n overtime sure his system works in the nfl. i wouldnt hate it but id look elsewhere
ClevTA,i remember him being decent at arkansas and some touting him as a late round sleeper but never thought of him as a legit nfl qb.  it is  a good thing this denver coaching staff has a great offensive systme lol this should be interesting
ClevTA,if u said they are poorly coached and undisciplined i wouldve agreed with u. what i tried to proclaim was that they were in  years old you are words lay down and die. that means quitting. so again no idea what u are talking about

aluckyaday,possibly. but there are advertising laws that should cover that. any pro that moans about restrictions without explaining why they exist and how that benefits most punters loses respect in my book. moan about them targeting vulnerable people by all means but n overtime restrictions..
aluckyaday,he knows what the reason is just because others  daily fantasy sports  does n overtime mean it is n overtime possible. its also in a very specific market. why would what he is doing translate to other sports/markets? i believe   test is across many markets?

aluckyaday,i think intrastate betting is a big hindrance to the potential success of sports wagering in general! but yes exchanges live and die on liquidity. fragmenting that liquidity n overtime allowing customers in different states to be matched against each other would be a nightmare!
aluckyaday,for those familiar with distributions would you expect it to be log logistic? this is a distribution of percentage increase in my price over bfsp rather than the actual difference between my price and bfsp. does that make sense? or should it still be normal?

EdMillerPoker,there's no way to offer a truly fair bet to a customer in-play while putting an 8 second delay on it and then also refusing some of the bets. fortunately american sports all have many timeouts and this is when in-play betting should take place.
EdMillerPoker,for sure i agree most of the benefits dont come from the quality of education (tho th against the spread n overtime zero either). i think most freshmen would be giving up a l overtime tho if they dropped out to take a job somewhere.
EdMillerPoker,imo freeroll isn't the right word because you sacrifice a ton the moment you sign a contract. i think self-publishing is a better o point ion for most non-fiction authors these days but there are some conditions under which the agent/publisher route might be better.

nonrandomalpha,i appreciate  years old you are analogies but theyre completely impractical and borderline nonsensical. you can put on a $1m position across large cap equities without even moving the needle; whereas good luck getting that action down on magic/nets on a weekday - especially in-game...

nonrandomalpha,"h overtime off the presses:  #supercontest week 1 lines!

i'm expecting #rams and #ravens to be in the top 5 consensus picks with the #rams possibly being the no 1 most popular pick. huge #alpha opportunity if you wanted to take the #panthers at -2.5"
nonrandomalpha,overreact 101: its the #preseason...no starter on gb is going to purposely wreck him (maybe 3rd stringers would have tried); from jacksons perspective its completely reckless to even flirt with this type of dangerous run in what is a practice game...reflects a low football iq
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is his background entirely what he did with saints before becoming bears gm. i  daily fantasy sports  know how to evaluate this exactly i'm sort of deferring to consensus/steelmanning.

i agree though his late round success is probably just variance (and called that out)."
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah at some point even the opportunity costs of setup (hiring competent people who can process the data having them do it adding those insights into  years old you are process etc.) can seem insurmountable. institutionally it makes sense how it can be skipped over.
LeeSharpeNFL,"my guess is  it is  harder on london games for west co assit teams than e assit co assit teams (but called it out specifically).

you're right on lac it looks the nfl moved that game since i l assit did a schedule import. thanks."
LeeSharpeNFL,probably somewhat less but n overtime necessarily. bears signed mike glennon before dra free throw ing trubisky. broncos signed joe flacco before dra free throw ing drew lock (granted 2nd round but point remains). washington signed case keenum before dra free throw ing dwayne haskins.
LeeSharpeNFL,"playoffs seeds if locked a free throw er today:

AndyMSFW,"daily fantasy sports  understand the buyback on the 49ers.  i liked the playcalling from cincy l assit week but missed the number and as much as i teased  about his rationalization on the 49ers travel it still is a b2b roadie.

cincinnati -1.5 +102 5dimes"
AndyMSFW,"had some coffee and found some more r3  plays that i want to get in before i go work in the yard.

AndyMSFW,guessing wofford opens around -7 or so.  you could go with high juice alternate lines perhaps?  wofford -3 in one and uncg +11 in the other try to give  years old you are self a big middle?  this is a bit of an unusual situation.
JoeyKnish22,so few people in the office the movement lights are off everywhere and im sitting in darkness at my desk in a corner streaming this bowl game. mostly just hoping to catch a funny clip of the red blob since the game is terrible. #eatarbys
JoeyKnish22,no doubt. personally i bought on the cowboys +5000 (sb)/+2000 (nfc). i know garretts a moron but theyre more talented better qbhealthier and have a higher ceiling imo. and this is probably the lowest realistic buy sp overtime (or they wont make the playoffs lol)
JoeyKnish22,i typically hate 90 percent  of ejections in college. but that was an avoidable hit on a defenseless player with crown of helmet right to the chin which tkod the player from the game. its like the definition of what youd eject a guy for.
JoeyKnish22,still some ravens +120s around to win the afc north. bet some for yourself and add some more for  years old you are favorite uncle. we can go to the bank together a free throw er the season and buy me a new gold chain.
JoeyKnish22,lol im n overtime gonna go that far. i played a cheap o6.5 rsw small th against the spread as far as ill go. division is tough schedule is front loaded but the team is definitely improved. potentially significantly improved if bevells system produces (tbd).
TheKostos,"guys i haven't lost a bet since the chargers on monday night. i am up a l overtime this week.

keep that in mind when deciding to follow or fade.

(hint: fade fade fade fade)

(extreme kanye life of pablo voice: i feel it fade)"
LockyLockerson,"oh yeah there's no question that the number ""makes sense"" from a l overtime of different standpoints with the loss of talent for stanford being one of them.  i think  it is  just interesting more as a situation we basically never see with this team."
LockyLockerson,ind buf: same deal this isnt correct.  buffalo +2.5 -110 to win 1x.  im on my phone so i cant compare money lines everywhere.  ill say bills  moneyline for 1x now and come back later when i can fill in the best widely available one
LockyLockerson,there is n overtime a math-based reason to bet under 2.5 right now i'll just say that.  but they sure will be a fun team to ro overtime against all year if you make the bet because many days they're going to get completely walloped.
DannyParkins,i just went to put a caller on the air and he was snoring! i put a dude to sleep. though in fairness he wanted to talk about the bears offense so i'll tell myself  that is  what knocked him out.  that is  a first...
DannyParkins,i said it should be a bigger story so i'm leading my national show with boxing having 2 deaths in a week. prohibition doesn't work what would? why  daily fantasy sports  people care? a former fighter who fought norton forman  spinks joins us. sirius 206
DannyParkins,honestly man subtweeting is weak. youve g overtime no examples but just dont like me. fine. ill defend myself against lies. ive volunteered at  donated $ and raised over 15k when kc dra free throw ed tyreek hill. im comfortable with my opposition to dv.
DannyParkins,i g overtime the criticism of the newsroom at the time as having unrealistic dialogue (like all of sorkin's work) and bad relationship stuff however i loved the show and  it is  idealistic look at the power of journalism. i'd be all-in on a comeback.
DannyParkins,alright im off to #scorehouse. im gonna try to be active on instagram at dannyparkins1 but leave stuff here you wanna know. who do you wanna hear from? both cubs and sox. want the return of pick-a-player? lets hear from the  #mob in the replies.

chadmillman,this is why i read  i was able to create odds for every possible number in this market and included it in my super bowl prop calculator. it gave me a median of 112.5 yards with a 55 percent  chance it goes over this number.
Gingfacekillah,"looking for mykhailiuk to underperform tonight snell to slightly underperform. drummond likely dampened by trade drama but th against the spread an anecdotal consideration and n overtime enough to base a wager on. numbers suggest a good game for him. well see.

Gingfacekillah,first r success on day 3. partitioned the data then used random forest bagging ensemble method to amalgamate my 7 models. boosted prediction from 70.9 percent  to 98.03 percent . i barely understood what i did programming wise but made it work. #firstsuccess #rstudio #machinelearning
logan_matthews9,you think you have a 55 percent  edge using  years old you are model bet the assit ros even money and they close +200. do you adjust? because theres a really strong indicator that whatever  years old you are model found wasnt worth a shit
logan_matthews9,i used the kelly criterion (which i know its g overtime flaws but i think it works for this exercise) to determine if and how much i would bet on any given match and given outcome. then i took actual results and gathered the outcome
PikachuBets,"nobody fucking bots  years old you are bets looooooooollll imagine botting $250 limits

PikachuBets,could you be more fucking retarded lol. lockatron didn't just post about the account willy nilly. someone posted about it in the chatroom on the website that there was a huge copycat fraud out there and  that is  why a tweet was sent by op
PikachuBets,"no feeling quite like getting limits cut bc ""we can't afford it"" but then winning more $ than l assit week bc lower limits means more bets and less variance lol. wonder if bookie will be on suicide watch later when he sees his sheet"

PikachuBets,also the problem with the statistic here is 1) sample size only looking at one month of hiring 2) no details on no specific requirement category; ill bet a l overtime of those are no requirement but college strongly preferred which is functionally the same

adamchernoff,"the only team to have a line move in their favo you are (from open to close) and cover in week 9 is oakland.

adamchernoff,handicap nfl totals is to look at negative (behind by 8+) neutral (within one score) and positive (leading by 8+) play calling tendencies. the variance of run/pass percentage depending on the scoreboard and situation within teams is enormous. i think with every total a bettor...
adamchernoff,my take away is that its the other way around. i think both of these offences will be just fine but these defences combined with it being week one magnified things. n overtime downgrading the bears and just a slight upgrade on gb for me.
adamchernoff,"back at it!

TheCousinSal,hey - if youre in nj or pennsylvania feel free to bet on my custom sal special and when it loses  will give you  years old you are money back.  and then an unfortunately-placed fan will blow said money away forever. the end. #zeke #dak
TheCousinSal,quick update-on my #againstallodds podc assit we gave out joe harris (8/1) to win the 3  point . contest  kevin durant (10/1) to win mvp. to be fair  said martin laird (dead l assit place) would finish in the top 20 at the genesis open.
TheCousinSal,guys my mother just read on facebook that if you can hold  years old you are breath for 10 seconds without coughing then you dont have the coronavirus - so the president can slow down on getting us those testing kits. we g overtime this!
12Xpert,you may notice that the shape of the distribution goes a bit funny at extreme values and looks like the area under the curve is 1 this is the unfortunate side effect of using discrete data points to model what is essentially a continuous distribution.
12Xpert,i certainly think placing employees at the heart of a company as corbyn has suggested is a good idea. this increases stakeholder ownership and encourages more sharing of risks. skin in the game is the best way to encourage people to do the right thing.
12Xpert,i mean obviously no one would think themselves sharp for randomly betting on every match but many punters with profits from their clever forecasting systems betting to  closing prices a free throw er 10180 bets would think they were so. how many really would be?
12Xpert,that is  certainly a valid view. however i think a more accurate view is that qataris just aren't interested  haven't bothered turning up which then very much makes this about money since what's point in holding it in a country  that is  n overtime interested?
12Xpert,the same result would be met with exactly the same arguments: someone broke the electoral law; we didn't know some things; you are stupid. these are all attem points  to prevent the uk leaving.  it is  so completely disingenuous to suggest  it is  anything else.
12Xpert,that could be legislated against but you would undoubtedly see a change in the odds it sports at le assit which would impact the majority of customers. however i suppose the majority of customers either  daily fantasy sports  know or care too much about odds.
12Xpert,"the rule is clear the interpretation will n overtime be unless ifab has provided a detailed list of specific handball situation with hands and arms in specific positions and provided measurements to describe what ""unnatural"" means. merely saying it will be obvious proves the point."
12Xpert,yes but the point is they can despite only being able to process one 30 millionths of the moves a computer can. so surely that tells you they are doing different things and therefore there are environments where the human brain will outperform the computer.
12Xpert,so alexander zverev's best game is n overtime good enough to take the first set off a below par novak djokovic. if he ever wants to be considered a great he's g overtime a l overtime of work to do both physical and mental. #rollandgarros
12Xpert,ahh i think i get it you're creating a single implied probability by combining the two models with different weights. i think it will be hard to find signal via this method. i imagine even 538's implied probabilities are pretty efficient when compared against outcomes.
12Xpert,but if they failed to adjust it sufficiently they they would simply introduce account restrictions.. but  that is  n overtime going to happen because their model is all about trying to understand what true prices are and managing risks around that too maximise their profit.
12Xpert,since we'll never know which matches will see new information which will move against 538 and which will support it it becomes a random exercise. i suppose this has always been my general warning to bettors. news is random (by definition it has to be).
JambosPicks,we've received several questions and have decided to do a podc assit to answer them.  please dm us any qs you have related to jambos and  will answer every respectfully asked question.  podc assit will be posted thursday so please submit questions before 8pmet wednesday.

capjack2000,this promo is an example of decent $ positive expected value but poor certainty equivalency (ce). given the relatively short duration of the bet and the bankroll required  it is  hard to make a case for n overtime throwing a benja minutes on this.

dinkinc,i was being sarcastic  altho at times and with certain trainers it is accurate...  dead on the board n overtime alive in pic 3's ... did you know that computer players only bet certain trainers when they run underlays....  tough game... entertainment only now
dinkinc,daily fantasy sports  most pros use some kind of tools that come with a price... isn't that what the racing form is... trainer st against the spread and workout info and some touts picks that is part of the package when you buy it
dinkinc,i just defended t.  i thought that was important.  debating you about health insurance is not. i have medicare now at le assit until this president takes it away to help pay for parades and golf. i am done andy. have a good day
ProfessorShine,no i am n overtime usually opposed to free picks.  large forums like tan and vsin should be held to a slightly higher standard with regard to their experts.  i dont even care so much about w\l record;  just dont give out idiotic info
ProfessorShine,i did it for networking and it worked. i g overtime good advice from one who told me to start listing  percent  risk and be careful of getting too much attention.  it only takes one to re-engineer ones plays and there goes the edge
suuma810,the #niners are a team with a wide range of outcomes depending on how good their offense can be. jimmy garoppolo has fewer career dropbacks than baker mayfield or sam darnold - n overtime a great sample size to work with. my team preview:
ClevTA,denver had 2 tos u didnt want to protect the boundary there. all plays were available for denver there. and if u gave all the cushion in the world denver completes a pass over the middle near the 50 anyways. its the same thing
ClevTA,ok so the one team that wasn't top 14 on offense (car at 24th) produced 5.8 yds/play and allen 307 pass yards (7.1 ypp) in snow on the road.  that is  still n overtime good vs a team that averages 5.3 on the season
spanky,dge is so out of touch with reality.  if transparency is so important why dont they force every licensed bookmaker in the state of nj to admit that the odds they offer are originated by these same unlicensed offshore sports books they are shunning.
spanky,"very few bookmakers worldwide book me directly.  

i rely on betting partners to supply accts for me and we share the profits. 

this is very different from tout services which charge bettors for picks.  most touts must do this because they cant win betting."
spanky,"is there any show or podc assit out there that focuses on generic technical analysis (line movement) as opposed to fundamental analysis (handicapping) in the sports betting world?

spanky,a proper bookmaking operation should be on autopilot.  customers should constantly be profiled and lines should auto move based on customer and bet amount.  delays should be nonexistent. cris pinny sbo ibc have been doing this for years yet no one follows suit. (4/6)
spanky,open up  years old you are donbest screen... starting from the le free throw  ask the owners of all the major sportsbooks if im respected.  wait -you probably dont have a donbest screen and you definitely dont know any owners. move on troll #keephatin
spanky,this is a very important point most media get wrong.  kudos to  betting has always been legal.  mere bettors have been exem point  from wrong doing federally as well as in most states for decades. scotus has allowed states to offer legalized regulated bookmaking.
spanky,in my opinion complete banishment and severe limitation are excessive measures. bookmaking is very different from blackjack.  competent bookmakers can use sharp information to their advantage.  the problem is most are either too lazy to do so or  daily fantasy sports  know how to.
spanky,i heard about that fezzik guy winning a contest several years ago.   i dont care about contests and i dont care about records.  i dont even know the other guys you mentioned.  who bets enough to move the number and beat the closing number.
spanky,despite pinnacle leaving us market they are still on everyones donbest screen... their reputation is impeccable.... i wish limits were higher but they are a european/asaian sportsbook now.. i commend the for even dealing us sports still... cant ever say anything bad about them
PlusEVAnalytics,update: son lucked into a 2-1 record despite having by far the weakest deck. hes normally a shy kid but i had to have the sportsmanship talk with him a free throw er he taunted a grown man. all in all a huge success.
PlusEVAnalytics,so the argument is essentially that assuming you have a + expected value position to begin with multi accounts allow you to get more action down. i buy that but you would run into diminishing returns - and more quickly on a short slate.

aluckyaday,i think the rest of the world has come to the conclusion that taxing individual gambling income is too hard. in the uk you are n overtime taxed on gambling income. that burden is born by the books. maybe some federal guidance is needed?
aluckyaday,this is going to be an interesting one for the e-wallets. do they risk being banned from gambling transactions?  daily fantasy sports  think it is a solution though as a problem gambler could always transfer from a credit card to their bank account first.
aluckyaday,"i forg overtime one.

aluckyaday,the two bets in question were man of steel (you were right it is similar to league mvp by the sport was rugby league n overtime soccer) and for the team he played for to finish in the top 5 of the league. 2/x

pittsburgh steelers at san francisco 49ers back san francisco 49ers -6.5
new orleans saints at seattle seahawks back new orleans saints +4.5
los angeles rams at cleveland browns back los angeles rams -3.5"
aluckyaday,that is mainly because the salaries are low n overtime because people can't get jobs. why be a nurse here when you can get 3 times that in the uk where there is a demand. there is a shortage of staff here this summer!
aluckyaday,i think that is the whole point of the paper. how you use  years old you are model edge regressed to the market and then change how much you regress as  years old you are confidence in the edge changes. or something like that
aluckyaday,exactly. they have models that are better than the market because they get to test them against everyone else. that allows them to set individual lines to maximise their profits rather than lines that are individually efficient. a books objective is different to bettors!
aluckyaday,sundays -7.47 percent  from 368 bets an 18 percent  chance by luck if zero edge. overall +10.93 percent  over 4324 bets a 0.00 percent  (only calculate it to 2dps) chance by luck. cheating a little as that includes bog. without bog only 6 percent
aluckyaday,referendums have no place in a representative democracy! it is their job to do what they believe is in the best interests of their constituents. i believe a ge is the only solution but that probably won't produce a parliamentary majority for anything either!

nonrandomalpha,been watching him kick since at uf  all training camp i ke point  saying he was the best candidate with the highest ceiling - regardless of short term setbacks. bears g overtime lucky keeping him tho - this staff really mismanaged the testing process
LeeSharpeNFL,regardless of the term it comes down to the same thing. data shows there's no relationship between  years old you are success on the p assit few plays and  years old you are success on the next one (once adjusting for general team strength).
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  fun to make fun of the bears situation with trubisky (i do it constantly) but at le assit the bears only have to pay him $9m to be the backup for whoever they can trade a second round pick for this offseason.
LeeSharpeNFL,it certainly is a factor. like cpoe i was making it team situation agnostic. i doubt ssoe is nearly as stable as cpoe but in theory  that is  part of the point is l measuring the variance. i need to dig into it more.

JoeyKnish22,folks. regression szn is coming l assit chance to buy a piece of this baby before they fall off. im willing to include a signed copy of rounders as well. dms open. bidding starts now at $100 no time to look at the schedule.
JoeyKnish22,l overtime of season to go. dra free throw  order can really shake up. trades can happen etc. but if a non-qb goes number 1 its chase young and a couple teams now already with rookie contract qbs are in the 1 pick convo.
JoeyKnish22,probably speaks to how bad game management strategy and general philosophy are across football in general. put if you can hire a couple competent coordinators you can basically put a rah rah figurehead as  years old you are hc and keep the ship afloat.
JoeyKnish22,yup th against the spread the x factor. can a bevell offense be productive/efficient enough in the 2019 nfl for them to have success. especially without an elite/mobile qb like he had in sea. im dubious but think the defense should be vastly improved.
TheKostos,"first question to kyle shanahan needs to be ""why in the world did you think it was a good idea to call the final possession the way you did?""

second question ""why  daily fantasy sports  you bend  years old you are hat brim jerk?"""
TheKostos,"we are minutes away from going live with breakdowns of every nba game  every relevant  college basketball  game tonight (and maybe if  likes something off the beaten path too). 

follow  for the link to listen/watch live when we start we're getting right into it"
TheKostos,n overtime totally upset as a titans bettor because i expected the chiefs to score 30+ no matter the game scri point . if you bet the titans its because you think they can score enough to keep up. i still think they can.
LockyLockerson,"i do think that people will read stories like ""ben simmons gets most mvp betting tickets"" and get really confused and maybe even think he's a good bet when in reality once it comes off triple-digits total pass. maybe pass anyway despite the intrigue."
LockyLockerson,all good wh against the spread probably more pertinent is that super teams in general dont fizzle.  they maybe dont win the title but price-grabbing a class of this caliber is probably a great idea even to hedge them later or in the tournament.
LockyLockerson,i should probably be mad at kyrgios for being such a huge douche all the time but i dunno i kind of enjoyed the video. dude threw a tennis chair. and he g overtime disqualified. rules were enforced.  i think i'm good with everything.
LockyLockerson,yes i agree with at le assit the general outline of this.  i'm fine pushing back against specifics but the idea of just generally letting more teams in or generally increasing the number of playoff games/series doesn't really seem bad at all to me.
DannyParkins,depends what you tell the qb privately when you meet with his agent. money talks in free agency. also depends what you do in training camp n overtime say in january. todays vote of confidence was for mitch as he heads into his offseason.
DannyParkins,you keep tweeting me incessantly and brag about being blocked by media people. youre an anonymous obsessed troll who i assume is a grown man get a life. and is bluechew supposed to be an insult? those commercials pay for my annual european vacation.
DannyParkins,"g overtime a good video of eloy rounding the bases and the celebration on my instagram story dannyparkins1 if you wanna check it out. 

(im trying to get better at instagram its tough for an old millennial such as myself)

 is gonna coach me."
chadmillman,totally fair criticism. growing pains/lack of communication between o you are editorial team and the best bets team driven by algorithms. we realized it a free throw er we released and came up with a plan to make the difference more clear going forward.
Gingfacekillah,"bayesian statistics the fun way is a perfect introduction to bayesian statistical inference imo. 

agreed on the lrs book - it didn't have much. was hoping for a slightly more technical treatment of  college basketball  from someone with a background in finance. oh well."
Gingfacekillah,pretty sad ball by the pistons. had some nice looks and seem to be buying into the casey offense scheme....but they hit 10/38 3's. if they can get their 3p percent  up they could surprise some teams with the high variance style of play.
Gingfacekillah,totals require a totally different set of data inputs and have given me some trouble. i've been focusing on  moneyline and ps winners the l assit while. pace considerations and other metrics become more important for totals but its something i'm working on slowly.
logan_matthews9,couple guys who im on minimally or n overtime at all that i like in this market are fowler and morikawa. 35.4 percent //59.8 percent  and 33.3 percent //56.1 percent  respectively. likely will only hit top ten as the field is very shallow imo
logan_matthews9,th against the spread something youd know better than me - if field isnt an o point ion for a bet like that does it push or lose? golf winners come to mind... agree that its poorly written and n overtime it good taste
PikachuBets,was there ever a substantiated fear that hes even considering leaving? for his parents to have paid so much for yale instead the shit d3 schools he g overtime i thought i touchdown  be a given that hes going for dat yale degree tho
PikachuBets,p.s. i'm talking flat bets n overtime his scaled bets in his record. his video now claims his flat bet record has averaged 70u. this is impossible given the public results we actually saw him share for only like 3 months on his spreadsheet.
adamchernoff,everyone loves  i remember first listening to him on drive this and game on with  and  about 12-13 years ago. it was a nice perk of skipping high school classes. back when thescore was still a canadian tv network and n overtime an app/bookmaker.
adamchernoff,well yes and no. i understand n overtime being able to rebuild an existing space but i  daily fantasy sports  understand a billion dollar company n overtime putting in the time to hit any of the fundamental aspects of creating a reasonable gaming experience.
adamchernoff,no i am n overtime suggesting to run and bet wentz mvp at 50/1. but i am baffled at how shallow and short sighted some insight from reporters can be and the ripple effect it has into betting markets and how other people think.
adamchernoff,"almost all professional bettors rely on an live odds feed - but many bettors may find the screen intimidating.

here are some tips on setting up and organizing an odds screen so you can anticipate when and where influential money will enter the market."
adamchernoff,"poor choice of wording. i kind of sum them all up to be the same as ""representation and advocation of product"" is promised by the big five regulators too. once the check clears that all goes to n overtime until another letter is required."

ToddFuhrman,i always joke if they told kids in school all those st against the spread and probabilities classes would pay off later in life we'd all have paid closer attention...can see it now 7th grade math teachers handing out parlay cards for educational purposes
ToddFuhrman,it is  amazing that other states haven't followed their business model with open competition reasonable tax rates and full mobile to achieve healthy business volumes.  just a matter of time if states do it right before nv falls out of the top 10 imo
ToddFuhrman,i'm right there with you; would stop the clock only on goals and injuries but run it when the ball is out of play.  still  daily fantasy sports  think it would change the flow/feel of a sport i grew up playing and still love
TheCousinSal,warning: betting on the warriors at home to cover in the third quarter hasnt lost since back when steph curry spent his days gnawing on a baby bottle nipple. okay...n overtime that long...but a very very solid trend.  3rd 1/4 currently gsw -2.5. #gambling
TheCousinSal,"my 12 year-old re jr smith at the end of regulation....

holy crap. 
1. he could have just put it back up
2. he could have passed the ball to lebron
3. or he could have showed up to the game n overtime high"
TheCousinSal,one of my favorite sports overreactions is when a golfers drive is way off course. the announcer leaves him for dead and then the golfer smashes his 2nd sh overtime within 15 yards of the hole. its almost like these guys are pros. #masters2018
TheCousinSal,the shortest  touchdown  under 1.5 yds prop hits again.  th against the spread 7 of the 9 playoff games.  also there will be a score in l assit 2 minutes of 1st half has never ever lost in a p against the spread game.
12Xpert,""" have an xg database containing over 15000 matches. the expected goal difference in this match was just over 4 in liverpools favo you are making this the joint-eighth best away performance by this measure... and the finest from the 1328 premier league matches."""
12Xpert,from memory when i tested my woc model on the extra leagues data (which includes brazil and argentina) it was profitable but a little short on expectation implying pinny's odds for those leagues are n overtime quite as efficient as for the main leagues.
12Xpert,so lets go back to the beginning. the links between cause and effect in betting are very weak just as they are in poker. that means most n overtime all but most of what happens luck. betting like poker is a low validity environment.
12Xpert,is there data in those graphs that supports this position i.e. old while male wealth correlates with privilege? is is n overtime an example of conformation bias to assume that these people must be privileged? isn't it possible that some have worked very hard?
12Xpert,what benefit is having them listed on resolver?  are listed i submitted my case 3rd april they aren't the slightest bit interested in replying. 8 days until escalation with ibas which will get absolutely nowhere because no one gives a **** about the customer/affiliate
12Xpert,and  are just morally reprehensible full stop because they claimed their affiliate business was a brand liability so shut it ruining the businesses of many but in reality continued to work via third party relationships with the very people who brought it into disrepute
12Xpert,picking up from l assit week i've now had a look at relative performance of  v  closing odds as means of predicting actual rois. following my previous work hypothesis is: implied 538 odds / fair pinny odds = exp roi. here's how things look.

mschwimer,but buy 100 packages at le assit if you think what we have is bs. you get 1000000 if you are right and only lose 300000 if you are wrong. if you truly believe we cant do it you would make that purchase. right?
mschwimer,its hard to believe o you are government is discriminating against an entire group of people because their brain chemistry is different than most. when has discrimination turned out well for americans? its like we refuse to learn from o you are previous mistakes.
mschwimer,interesting points. the ironic thing is advanced analytics show that strikeouts are turrible (barkley voice) for hitters. in fact its the most important thing a pitcher can do. problem is advanced analytics also show power is more important than putting the ball in play.
RufusPeabody,update: heres the  now-c assit  o you are model predicting the committees rankings coming out in 30 mins. we sl overtime georgia ahead of florida due to h2h considerations. the index shows how close these are in many cases. wide range of outcomes!
RufusPeabody,question for  if i get credit accounts with a credit line of 100000 (i  daily fantasy sports  have to put in anything up front) and i lose one week and have to pay 10000 but the next week win 20000 what's my roi?
RufusPeabody,i do have love for the bankers at the stephanie  sunset  branch in henderson nv. theyve treated me so well over the years. i feel like im seeing old friends every time i go. but the company as a whole? n overtime good.
RufusPeabody,weather as well as its impact on variance is factored in. if you think 12 back has much of a chance despite the conditions im guessing you havent looked at the data. it happens a l overtime more rarely than you might think.
RufusPeabody,"i agree there is inherent recreational ""value"" to betting. people have been gambling for centuries. but people can also still be manipulated to gamble more than they would otherwise by marketing app design etc. to a point they end up with a problem."
jeffma,n overtime trolling here. would probably be nice to let potential customers know what you advise them to have in terms of an overall bankroll. with the number of plays you have the number is a l overtime larger than they may realize
SportsCheetah,well back to my initial tweet i dont think taking game data and applying them to the future is useless. complaining on twitter is sure but everyone needs to vent every once in awhile who really cares. he probably lost a few christmases.
SportsCheetah,end having seen bama and texas offenses already. it was the uga game primarily where i was on ou 1h and i brought it up because uga hadnt face an offense anywhere near what ou was doing (sec title game was vs. auburn).
capjack2000,"let us  do a little math breakdown on that $333k parlay hit that everyone is talking about. 

first the payout was $333k but that includes the original stake of $7050. so it was actually $326k. or +4625 in us odds.

 let us  assume..."
capjack2000,"there's also no money in it for us if these operators make their product wholly unsustainable too. 

tossing out the players who lose less than 4 percent  is damaging...but spending $700 cpa to find those players in the first place is truly ."
capjack2000,they must think americans dont like to push on their bets because you cant push a total in any sport. all totals end in 0.5. youll need to figure out which side you want to be on and  deal with the non-standard vig:
capjack2000,"in honor of talk like a pirate day  here's my pirate joke:

capjack2000,"nv is weird in that it allows the operator to choose what kind of reporting they wish to use. they can choose (tickets written - tickets cashed) or (just completed events only). 

all of these monthly reporting numbers from states are poorly done."
capjack2000,it is  interesting that brand loyalty would factor into the equation for ny bettors coming over to bet. you'd think they'd bet in-person at fd's bm book and utilize mobile for some line shopping. the numbers in the chart solely reflect mobile revenue.
capjack2000,"here's an interesting chart to ponder. in august 2018   had a virtual monopoly of mobile sports wagering in nj. now they trail  by almost a 2:1 margin. 

what made the fd product more appealing for dk to lose a first-to-market advantage so quickly?"
capjack2000,"i wouldn't mind seeing an advertising aggregation service start up so that content providers do n overtime have to deal directly with casino/sportsbook advertisers. 

i'd be far more comfortable having ads if there was a level of plausible deniability between me and them."
capjack2000,"both dra free throw kings and fanduel started out in nj with a huge book of customers. 
both had similar pricing. similar offerings. similar promos.

fanduel is now crushing dra free throw kings in revenue. 

i wonder what one thing they do differently?"
capjack2000,in pa if you leave  years old you are child alone in a casino (or casino parking lot) you are banned for life from all pa casinos. its a reason why the black book in pa has over 1000 entrants (nv has 49).
robpizzola,if you are modeling games trust  years old you are numbers get down earlier in the week. if numbers are moving  years old you are way you're going to be successful. if numbers are regularly moving against you back to the drawing board.
robpizzola,"you can still trust the defense if you dont score on the opening possession. 

baltimore g overtime 2 possessions in  overtime pittsburgh g overtime one. th against the spread inexcusable when you can be the team that chooses to have the first possession."
robpizzola,couldnt agree more. absolutely love him. think he could thrive in a 4-2-3-1 with him sitting behind the striker (they tried this for a couple matches and abandoned it) but they need a world class midfielder and they dont have one right now.
robpizzola,aiming to do a periscope qa sometime between 5 and 6pm est today. if you can't make it live or just  daily fantasy sports  want to publicly ask a question dm me and i'll make sure  years old you are question gets answered.
RASPicks,i'll firmly disagree back. getting a large number of people to be successful following someone (including getting the right price on their bets getting/keeping accounts etc) is certainly a l overtime messier and extremely difficult to scale.  i have some experience with this.
VegasRefund,cam is going to get ripped by the media this week.. his release has always been awkward.. but this is the throw of a guy who is way more injured than what is being communicated the public.. or hes just markelle fultz 2.0.
VegasRefund,see snacks like goldfish/cheese-its are always at  years old you are house which suppresses the urgency to eat them... pistachios are more of a spontaneous snack combined with the light salt and non-filling lightness to them is why they are #1 most addicting.
ProfessorShine,yes but if  years old you are picks win like you say  years old you are affiliate will make limits much smaller for all  years old you are paying customers. aligning with bookmakers might make financial sense but it is an obvious conflict.
suuma810,"on touchdown-drives the #vikings have a pass rate of 68 percent  which is 12.5 percent  above league-average (the missing 5 percent  are penalties).

spanky,exactly which is an indicator of a 2nd tier wanna be bookmaker. do you think  or  give a crap if someone bets both sides of the same game? its comical how the individual players bets is more important than the shops chart. #beabookmakernotadressmaker

spanky,depends on the sport.. nfl 20kish ... big thing is  dont have delays. just like pinny or cris they hang a number and take a hit on that number.... delays are a sign of nervous bookmaking and can lead to unscrupulous air movement
spanky,runners in casinos isin't the answer.  they will all eventually get treated like outc assits just like i have.  the answer lies in hoping better sports books emerge who  daily fantasy sports  have to resort to the extreme measure of kicking out winners...

aluckyaday,good timing. so my recent losing run of 25 bets was nothing to write home about. n = 4756 o (average betfair sp) = 3.877 k = 28. if only the clients that leave a free throw er long losing runs understood this
aluckyaday,then you should know better than thinking the international companies that are coming in to the us are going to contribute to the liquidity spanky is talking about. acce point ing a $10 bet is a little different to a $1 million one!
aluckyaday,i guess its just a function of how reduction factors work. much easier to manage a single limit on an account rather than individual limits for each account for each market when you are dealing with millions of accounts and thousands of markets.
aluckyaday,joseph gets his percentage of occuring by chance using a null hypothesis that the mean of returns is zero and calculating p-values for it so you would think he should understand that if he could be bothered to read the theory behind it!
aluckyaday,if you can make a statistically significant profit at closing prices telling everyone  years old you are picks in advance is even dumber than n overtime understanding that  years old you are model results would happen by chance 25 percent  of the time!
aluckyaday,you could check to see how much of an error this assum point ion could create in the scores by assuming the margin was full distributed on each side to create a range in which the score would lie irrespective of margin distribution.
aluckyaday,"something one of their traders said in the twitter interview things they used to do stuck in my mind. ""we take a position in just about every market we operate because o you are margin is n overtime big enough n overtime too""."

LockyLockerson,"hosting  tonight with  you can listen live on the  app.

i will attem point  to talk about as many  college football  games as i possibly can while still remaining somewhat coherent.  eli will occasionally have to send for someone to hose me down."
LockyLockerson,just did a full ho you are with  on  podc assit talking college football and the guide (which comes out tomorrow) i think there's some really good stuff would encourage you to check it out.  will try to retweet when i see link.
LockyLockerson,"as  noted on his most recent  podcast the average nfl win total is off by 2+ wins (2.18 since 2010) which is significantly more than in college because in college so many games have insane spreads and are essentially ""bought"" wins.  less uncertainty."
EliHershkovich,". ""you better you bet"" (6-10 p.m. est m-f plus nfl sundays) launches a week from monday (aug. 19).

here's how degens can pr expected points added re:
* download the  app
* follow  
* get  years old you are bankroll ready

cc:"
EliHershkovich,"n overtime a given seton hall is the clear-cut second-best imo. xavier will give it a run for its money.

pirates' defense was inconsistent in big spots  marshall's growth at that end was a game-changer late in the season because of his length."
EliHershkovich,"incase you missed it : ""hersh on hoops"" offseason  college basketball  futures with  director 

 memphis' 80-1 to 14-1 odds shi free throw 
 msu a lock for deep run?
 could kansas deliver at 10-1?
 how down is acc?
 o you are favorite title picks"
EliHershkovich,"call it borderline fine. but mack turned the cards into a ncaa tournament team amid a ""surefire rebuild"" expecting big results a free throw er a year of development.

nwora's a stud plus enoch is back. williamson should flourish in that system too."
DannyParkins,i know his stats. so if hes a 3 win player at ~$8 million per win hes more than earning his money without including the intangibles he brings. i didnt say he was outperforming the contract just living up to it this year.
chadmillman,"listen on  years old you are way to work. 

+ bookmaker scooch struggles to figure out what we all want from the patriots.

+  and i get sage advice from pro bettor simon hunter when it comes to betting what the pros bet."
chadmillman,"g overtime this answer for you and  try either of these things. 
1. uninstall/re-install the app (make sure you are on most recent release). 
2. try switching the date (click on week 3) then switching it back to the current date (week 4)."
Gingfacekillah,bos looks good today. the only thing i  daily fantasy sports  like is the obviousness of this play. with lebron getting a 25-28 minute restriction and bos fighting to keep playoff competitive form this seems like an easy forecast. i guess we'll see.
Gingfacekillah,had some good results in regression with elastic net. have had some promising but n overtime yet definitive results in  moneyline using rf with bagging to replace a logistic regression model. still trying to learn the ropes in r so more to come.
Gingfacekillah,was just thinking about this....and imagined that in theory it might look something like this. where there was an o point imal intersection between line information and line inefficiency. just an idea. was curious if anyone has worked on something like this before.
logan_matthews9,"top x market:
rory t5 2.6
day t5 9//t10 5.5//t20 2.75
munoz t20 5.5

im sure at some point my munoz faith will pay off. finished t21 l assit week that wasnt upsetting at all. obviously going pretty big on day this week"
PikachuBets,bro pls get a fucking life. you can get the actual plays botted on  years old you are acct with ease. why you choose to forgo that and instead constantly bitch about the public releases is beyond me. stop being such a retard
PikachuBets,local news websites that make me turn off my adblock in order to read their scintillating 2-sentence remix of the espn game and tv guide schedule can truly fuck off every day of the week. i mean where the fuck is bangor anyway
PikachuBets,no it doesnt you simpleton. literally no attention needs to be paid for random nuisance suits filed. there are motion to dismiss templates online. any monkey could write one and i touchdown  take 2-3 weeks to tide over. get a clue holy jeez
PikachuBets,no youre wrong. line only came up at 9:40a wasnt 1k on sides until around 10:30a. it opens at 250 quickly goes to 500 stays there for a whole. either way 1k is nowhere near an opener. and no they dont collar accounts
PikachuBets,"fuck you man. where did i say they were the ""best ever."" i even said the players you mentioned were definitely better. i only they're n overtime as shitty as you were saying and they're n overtime pros. just fuck off you troll"
adamchernoff,be debatable. they will both be an exact number created by the process. the idea that betting less and being more conservative is actually backwards as n overtime maximizing opportunities can be equally detrimental to over betting. as someone who spoke very similar...
adamchernoff,"hay dos opciones.

determine que estadsticas son predictivas. (por ejemplo yardas por jugada).

determinar la probabilidad exacta de eventos. (por ejemplo cual es la probabilidad histrica de gol de campo ms que 44.5 yardas en un partido?)

crea un precio y buscar valor."
adamchernoff,"rush defence success rate vs offensive schedule 2018/2019

a basic starting foundation to begin research on defensive fronts for team by team analysis. the table shows how teams performed against opponents in 2018 and evaluates if the 2019 schedule easier or more difficult."
adamchernoff,"unfortunately in sports betting there are a number of other factors involved. the most obvious is that the true probability is uncertain and bookmakers margins create an additional ""fee"" to play the game. for example  let us  look at uruguay v japan tonight."
adamchernoff,"where 9 cents is always 9 cents. in betting 9 cents can mean very different things. sports betting - especially in north america - suffers from a l overtime of ""narrative regurgitation"". marketers make a narrative popular and a resource restricted audience takes"
adamchernoff,yeah. my tweet wasnt a jab at romo at all. im just surprised that so many people are surprised at what happens when someone talks about the basics of football and what happens on field. common meaningless narratives have completely over powered everything.
adamchernoff,"2018 twitter year in review  

it was a busy year! this thread below contains some of my favourite follows books podc assits and more in the betting industry. i encourage all to expand the thread share  follow those mentioned. 

 tap to expand below"
kellyinvegas,i just wished the jerk before us didnt chop her ears off. people get scared by her a l overtime (shes a big girl and will run up on you) but i swear if she had floppy ears it wouldnt be that way.
ToddFuhrman,"and no doubt some folks like the browns at 14-1 for me personally th against the spread nowhere close to my number on them so my opinion is overvalued 

as for my yankees sore subject; dont want to discuss their deadline dud ha"
ToddFuhrman,"it is  good that gambling is going mainstream but those reporting the news need to understand the industry

comparison made here by  is apples to oranges regarding lillard injury as driving force impacting change in blazers/warriors line from game 3 to game 4"
TheCousinSal,the flat out drops by wrs on 1 and 2 seeds are baffling. i get they may be out of sync but dont they still practice? it seems as if everyone who had the week off spent it on a different tropical island.
12Xpert,i suppose the worst one is overconfidence. bets can't happen without it unless everyone is irrational and wants to lose. almost always 1 side will be wrong (and sometimes both when an exchange commission is involved). yet both sides think they are right.
12Xpert,it is  just the principle of price discovery. of course humans are biased and facilitate inefficient prices but eventually those inefficiencies get understood and exploited away too. the market always evolves but the larger it becomes the harder it is to beat it.
12Xpert,here's the latest woc performance still publishing in real time (august 2015). 9548 matches avg odds 3.94 expected yield 4.17 percent  actual yield 3.78 percent .  that is  nicely within the bounds of standard error telling us system seems to be working well.
12Xpert,we  daily fantasy sports  have corbyn's socialism yet. i hope we never do. i agree this country could work for more people. i just happen to think that a healthy liberal democracy built on capitalist principles is the best way to achieve that.
12Xpert,lads lads lads  everybody. gvc calls for end to tv gambling ads  football shirt sponsorship. as owners of  who have possibly the nastiest ads of all i can't decide if this is ironic machiavellian a late april fool or they actually do care.
12Xpert,"there are many people who day trade for a living on the financial/currency markets. nearly all of them are tossing coins and will go bust in the end. ""commission motherfucker""  that is  the only real way to get paid in this business.

JambosPicks,"9/10 record: 3-2 +0.9 u
mlb: 5 plays 3-2 +0.9 u

cumulative records (vs. market consensus line): +162.19 u
mlb: 1370 plays +24.91 u
 college basketball : 1476 plays +146.69 u
 college football : 46 plays -3.19 u
nfl: 17 plays -6.22 u"
JambosPicks,yes. for any package its the recommendations that are made on final day is that package (always a monday) for games on that day.  so this weeks end with recs made tomorrow for games tomorrow.  17 week will be the same on 12/30.
RufusPeabody,i did tell the full story. i said you sent me the report. but look at my initial email. it was sent in june and i never heard back. im n overtime at all is surprised the reporter had the same experience.
RufusPeabody,interesting how qbs can rocket up dra free throw  boards based on one good year but nfl teams stick with these same qbs when they struggle because of talent and potential (which they believe because of 1-2 years of starting in college)
RufusPeabody,evaluating redskins/49ers game a tough task for models. you can (should!) control for weather but n overtime all rain games are the same. but it is a great example of how the impact of rain is different on grass than on turf.
RufusPeabody,at 4pm et on saturday this had a chance to be the worst betting week i've ever had. but a nice turnaround late saturday great nfl sunday and munoz shipping it in a playoff and somehow i pull out a winning week.
RufusPeabody,i was n overtime watching like a hawk. i have n overtime tracked jambos picks. i just pointed out some flaws back in march (you shouldnt post a pick using the wynn line at 4am  point  when the wynn book isnt open)
RufusPeabody,came across this 12year old email i wrote asking  for a job. i ended up taking a job that paid 25k a year because i loved it. had no idea where it would take me but definitely wouldnt have predicted this path.
RufusPeabody,"i do promote my win streaks and for those questioning why i do so the buyer has to make his decision based on all the info  said. 
translation: i knowingly take advantage of the fact that many bettors are fooled by randomness."
RufusPeabody,"what  will provide dc is n overtime sports betting;  it is  a sports lottery.

who this hurts: dc government (lost revenue) consumers (bettors)

who this helps: intral overtime members of the dc city council getting kickbacks maryland  virginia governments (down the road)."
RufusPeabody,i think he has the skills to be incredibly successful in business but needs to listen and learn. and realize that he doesn't have the answer to everything and sometimes there are people that know more than he does about an industry.
jeffma,making 36 percent  of  years old you are threes at that volume against a team that is much better than you is a pretty big stretch. that being said certainly the strategy should be to sho overtime a l overtime of 3s
SportsCheetah,i had a spiritual experience watching the mavericks and luka today. i even went to church today too. the next couple of moves they make will likely have the biggest impact on the league for the next decade. no pressure  and co.
SportsCheetah,it isn't public. neil's scri point  uses the tracking data to get expected  percent s based on the actual shots attem point ed during the game. can convert that into an expected amount of points for each team based on that data.
SportsCheetah,sac u39 -110 - projection is 35.6 wins. expect some regression from a breakout season. adding dedmon/ariza/joseph in a loaded west that g overtime even better as a whole isn't moving the needle. lost wcs. sixth-toughest sos. luke walton is the coach.
capjack2000,"bookmakers matt ask the bookmakers. 

they know who spanky is. they know his record. they  daily fantasy sports  want to have to fade his action. 

stop trying to gain followers by getting spanky to tweet about you.  that is  a pathetic angle."
capjack2000,"shouldn't have much of an effect on betamerica. either they'll continue to use sbtech for b2b odds or they'll find someone else. 

now  on the other hand...they're properly f'd when you factor in  doing the same thing with their acquisition of betbright."
capjack2000,sure i get their ske point icism.  it is  also why i  daily fantasy sports  work for or run an affiliate site. i'm just saying discounting every opinion of someone who has unobstructed access to the inside of the industry is short-sighted.
capjack2000,yep $2k! tax rate is 16 percent  for mobile operators. obviously suitability hearings and regulatory compliance will cost far more than $2k but the point being it'll enable a startup to try their hand in the maine market for relatively cheap.    2/4
capjack2000,i think  that is  the wrong (and a biased) narrative to take here. my take is you can't advertise that you have gambling in  years old you are dna and then be unwilling to take on all comers in widely available markets.
capjack2000,"i see where youre going. however its n overtime just about the ratio of sharps to public. its about expanding the definition of what it means to bet sports. 

the bookie -110 model is dying. there needs to be a new paradigm."
dinkinc,9-11 is a tough day for me....lost my friend robert alan miller as he was leaving the second tower....my mom's birthday she would have been 98 and also the birthday of the late fernando fisdel a great bookmaker and a better friend...
dinkinc,you hide behind a secured account ... you're negativity only hurts the horses and  it is  n overtime the first time...  anyone who hurts the horses is my enemy...  that is  two strikes... you  daily fantasy sports  want to strike out here
robpizzola,the reality is that juve has been complete dog shit this season and somehow getting results. this was going to happen eventually although i thought they were good up until the red. either way this team is going nowhere with this midfield.
robpizzola,fleury should save that and i know that theodore is gassed there too but he's cann overtime let hertl get to the top of the circle to take a shot. gave him way too much space before the first stick check came.
RASPicks,the fact that you couldn't/didn't anticipate backlash from the entire sharp twitter community shows how out of touch you are with everything.  btw also congr against the spread on getting entire sharp twitter community to agree on something for first time ever.
suuma810,"my mean projections were off by an average of 2.03 wins and 69 in total.

as a benchmark  final (and conservative) mean projections in their dvoa forec assit on 09/05 were off by an average of 1.94 wins and 65.8 in total."
suuma810,"london game information:

both teams will travel today a free throw er their practices. according to doug pederson the #eagles had an ""advanced team"" that had been doing the work for the pr expected points added ration ""since the schedule came out""."
ClevTA,u really dont understand the diff between going for 2 down 8 and the idiocy from garrett yesterday? talk about apples to oranges. mike still cant wrap his head around this its mind blowing. one has zero to do with the other
ClevTA,honest question bc i dont know the technicality. if a defensive player grabs an ol inside of his jersey around the front of the neck  is that considered def holding? isnt that what flowers did? its a weak call but just asking
CizzlingSports,"upd8:

17-week package 01: -47.20 units -$17160 for a $300 bettor (including fees) roll down from $22896 to $5736*

17-week package 02: -46.67 units -$17001 for a $300 bettor (including fees) roll down from $23781 to $5736*

*unvested guarantees excluded bc lol"
CizzlingSports,"or maybe when the show is live  just says ""my pick is actually ucf -13.5"" 

this isn't difficult and the ""graphics guys"" excuse is a lazy pretext. no one serious/knowledgeable about betting would ever claim a stale line unless you know scamming"
CizzlingSports,yeah i just want jambos to keep ignoring that the guarantee is illusory no matter how many bank letters are posted and as long as subscribers have to front a $1500 filing fee and costs to travel to and litigate in md
spanky,"b overtime betting is amateurish?  my bankroll says otherwise. 

 years old you are per head so free throw ware is the worst of the worst and will never compete with dgs.  you are a nobody in the business who trolls me nonstop."
spanky,"over the l assit yearive done all i could to expose 

1.) posted video of me getting thrown out

2.) helped  with his article.

3.) partnered with  who wrote his story for 

4.) publically asked  at #bosa why he kicks out sharps"
spanky,one of many who would applaud my banishment.  i came up in a world of walters baxter spiro henry qt and everyone in between and still found a way to earn.  rather than hate on me find a way to better yourself.
spanky,the best massage i ever had in my life was a that massage. i suffered from sciatica. the masseuse was able to stretch me so well she had my feet behind my head!  hurt like hell but majority of pain was gone.
spanky,we only look at  mlb  moneyline a free throw er 10am because we get 10k.  its the highest limit on mlb  moneyline on any app in nj.  im interested in seeing what the cf limits are gonna be once the season starts
spanky,also for clarity this 10k is the win limit n overtime the base limit....ceo told me th against the spread how they do it in australia. so if im betting an mlb +160 dog my max risk is 6250 to win 10k.
spanky,unbelievable...   posts picks for free trying to help people out and you call him a pos?!?  if you dont like his picks then unfollow him troll...  this is the reason why its a losing situation to try and help people with picks.
spanky,its so convenient for these guys to try and use my background as the reason for booting me. please be real. youre all wanna be bookmakers who dont know what the f*ck youre doing so you take the easy way out... nauseating

PlusEVAnalytics,so be careful out there everyone. its a free service and you get what you pay for but know were in the wild west. n overtime the will smith battling robots wickedy-wickedy-wild wild west the one where rules dont exist. the end.
PlusEVAnalytics,structured qualitative scouting: have scouts evaluate prospects on intangibles using a scorecard with attributes (work ethic teamwork etc) and a/b/c/d grades. then model (player performance / avg for dra free throw  position) as f(attributes like heightweightcollege st against the spread + intangible
PlusEVAnalytics,this is pure thievery. sure you cant have unlimited liability but then dont use track odds. the odds have 20 percent  vig because they have to pay all the expenses that you dont. so you free-ride plus you cap the winnings? gtfoh.
PlusEVAnalytics,cdn cannabis companies are struggling financially. imo their growth projections were way too aggressive - theres a big diff between legal and socially acce point able. nobody at office talking about im gonna get stoned this weekend. laws change instantaneouslyattitudes take time.
aluckyaday,i guess the biggest issue with beginners blindly using  moneyline to predict sports outcomes is overfitting. if when learning  years old you are model is predicting  60 percent  of points spread markets correctly its likely the model will be useless going forward!
aluckyaday,you will be surprised. once affiliate marketing takes hold and you have the price comparison sites like oddschecker recreationals will want accounts with every book. the europeans are going to change the way americans bet. spreads and totals will no longer dominate.
aluckyaday,but early betfair liquidity is pants. would n overtime be too difficult to push an early price out on betfair and then smash the books with guaranteed money! it goes on at the moment but with mbl the floodgates would be opened.
aluckyaday,i can't hence my question as to which one would make more sense. but easyfit says loglogistic is the best fit of several distributions using any one of kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and chi-squared whatever they are! ok i've heard of chi-squared
joeytunes2,basically we are holding duq who are tied at half with dayton. so i was asked to hedge. but if we were down 14 at half. you cant hedge and you would be  stuck on the wrong side with the entire bet.
EdMillerPoker,all of a sudden there's 9 figures of new investment capital thanks to us market. a l overtime of that money isn't going to be playing follow the leader on 365 esp since 365 themselves i think will struggle in the us.
EdMillerPoker,"o you are philosophy is quality over quantity.

 it is  trivial to churn out a lines and predictions on all sorts of games if you aren't concerned about consistently delivering predictions that are better than what's widely available in the betting markets."
EdMillerPoker,"there's a core question. ""why do those who have served the american market do business the way they do?""

there are many answers some unflattering. but some in europe completely discount the answer ""because it provides a core customer experience americans want."""
EdMillerPoker,tl;dr: i'm gonna be an active participant this football season on twitter answering  years old you are questions about in-play betting. ask me what you want and i'll answer to the best of my knowledge. if this interests you here's my suggestion.
EdMillerPoker,"though i have no idea exactly how those lines will be drawn from a legal perspective. i think more people today are worried about the raw data rights and ""unofficial"" data collection and for me there's no argument of bad faith there..."
EdMillerPoker,this is a key sports betting conce point   for what  it is  worth . which bets are good or n overtime depend as much or more on the size of the error bars as on  years old you are modeling point projections.
EdMillerPoker,if its n overtime on cardplayer website it either maybe g overtime published out of order or i dont know. all of the articles plus a l overtime more will be in a book im coming out with prob may pub date
EdMillerPoker,i think for most kids theres enough redundancy between what they get in school sports peer relationships whatever else that it kinda doesnt matter how well you parent most kids end up developing basic skills for adult success one way or another
EdMillerPoker,meh. seems obv to me the gripe isnt really about admissions standards its about the role elite universities play in curating o you are national power structures and the kid who many have identified as a formidable opponent just g overtime fast-tracked.
GolcondaFund,that was the point. jimmy g will get limited flack but if this was obj it would be end of the world. though there is worse things eroding society than just pc crap. namely greed deceit and a culture lacking moral fortitude.
nonrandomalpha,yeah its all relative. if players from the 30s were playing today they wouldnt be in the same mold as they were in the 30s. the players just havent changed the routines the diets the foods the training has all gotten better.
nonrandomalpha,this dude g overtime the spine to tell the truth. i never lost more respect for fellow bears fans than this season. new gen tru fanboys are schizo and such a poor reflection of chicago intellect. remind me of classic gb fans.
nonrandomalpha,live wagering will be even more fun/profitable once liquidity picks up and you can match trades peer-to-peer with a bookie only playing the role of a broker. true free market pricing. if you have a collateral bankroll could even create custom bets.
LeeSharpeNFL,"actually 538 had the ravens at 46 percent  to win the super bowl.

this means 538 thinks they are say 90 percent  to beat buf/hou/ten then 70 percent  to beat kc/ne then 70 percent  to beat sf/no. those all seem really high."
LeeSharpeNFL,agreed. when i first read  years old you are tweet i was thinking about tom brady and was going to disagree but then i saw the quoted tweet and that made me realize you probably meant prospects (and for those i agree).
LeeSharpeNFL,"ehhh this seems like a solid flex. there are no other games to choose from between two likely playoff teams.

if hou loses tonight i could see hou/ten as a potential afc south championship of sorts but there's really no great game."
LeeSharpeNFL,there's usually a second or so to spare by design so the back judge sees the play clock hit zero then looks to see if the snap's gone off. so there's a window there. also why delay of game can't be challenged.
AndyMSFW,"thanks for all the input on that decided to go with favorites and unders to make it hard on myself.  good luck everyone on  years old you are week 0!

JoeyKnish22,vegas dave in a multi-millionaire and some of you people think a handful of trolls are gonna save people from being scammed  lol. its an endless losing battle. yelling at clouds. theres too many god damn stupid people that cant be saved.
JoeyKnish22,a l overtime of people are saying tomlin and while i agree with that i didnt include him in that tweet because i bet tomlin for first coach fired this season and th against the spread n overtime good for the brand.
JoeyKnish22,if every qb falters its possible. but problem is all 3 osu candidates will vulture votes from each other. if burrow be against the spread bama its over. if bama wins but tua plays poorly or doesnt play the door is open.
JoeyKnish22,"you get ready to board an 8 ho you are flight....youve g overtime middle seat. you sit down only to see....
 has window. 
 has aisle. 

theyre both eager to talk sports and give you some winners!

 years old you are next move:"
JoeyKnish22,has it too. from my perspective its a really nice o point ion to have for futures if you play a l overtime of them. especially long sh overtime futures gives an o point ion outside of extending more capital for hedging.
LockyLockerson,will be on the show briefly tonight to discuss college football games this week since  spent a l overtime of monday and tuesday looking back and looking at cfp rankings (which was also really really fun and you should listen to it)
LockyLockerson,those are projections which because they are shaped completely by the market from those teams' previous games are pretty sharp.  why is the difference there? rest? injury? no reason? important questions to answer.  this early it has seemed like rest is overrated.
LockyLockerson,vegas never.  but the point is more that if you do n overtime offer a no the prices can be ke point  artificially low on every team with no repercussions and so that wouldnt necessarily be indicative of anything exce point  greed.

DannyParkins,well its finally here todays the day i pay off losing nfl picks for the year and pull the double shi free throw . ill host from 1-6 then do overnights with les from midnight til 5am and then do 1-6 tomorrow.
DannyParkins,yesterday wouldve been chris farleys 55th birthday so the real matt foley a pastor in arlington heights came on  to tell stories of hanging with farley his demons how the snl character came to be and presiding over his funeral. podc assit
DannyParkins,andy reid finally g overtime his hall of fame quarterback and in 2 seasons he won a super bowl an mvp and went to back to back afc title games. theyll win a l overtime more together the next decade or so.
Gingfacekillah,really depends how you want to approach it: parametric frequentist models bayesian approaches machine learning. my general approach is to try and leave no stone unturned. ive g overtime a ton of books recommended on my tl for you to peruse though!
Gingfacekillah,good example why  tip about a non-zero probability of injury/ejection etc. was such a killer tip. these possibilities skew a player's mean expectation when accounted for. n overtime much has to go wrong for an under to cash at the player level.
Gingfacekillah,"- my journey from electrician to law student/sports betting
- a simple mlb prop walkthrough (pitcher k's)
- qualitative prop handicapping advice (nba rebounds)
- sports modelling

quite a bit more as well. enjoyed talking to  as always. thanks for having me."
Gingfacekillah,"week 6:
atl -1
phi +3
phi ml
gb -4.5

philly should be able to shut down the viking's run forcing cousins to put balls in the air. should be a tighter game but i think the eagles take this one outright."
Gingfacekillah,this is a salient point. despite the potential for overfitting with  moneyline the data science field certainly makes all who study it vastly more aware of the overfitting problem generally and the tools and processes that can be used to mitigate it.
Gingfacekillah,have you ever done any analysis on the best time to bet? was thinking about this today. opening line is is missing info closing line is almost perfectly efficient. idea time to bet would be maximum information rate at lowest efficiency rate.
logan_matthews9,"why is the comment tasteless? do you have a l overtime of black lamar hate examples? 

i think the comment made you uncomfortable but if it doesnt apply to you then it shouldnt. 

i did laugh at the l assit line though"
logan_matthews9,this is so dumb. jozy is treated as some sort of pariah when hes actually one of the top three strikers the us has ever produced. that you want to hold him to some higher standard is on you n overtime him
logan_matthews9,anyways this was the first time in my betting career that my bet was limited! dropped from the posted $500 to $200. its a weird sense of pride to have but here we are. anyone g overtime any good first limit stories?
logan_matthews9,the qualifying tournament doesnt take place during a fifa window so any players who play for the first team wont get released - the exce point ion being mls players (who have typically released first team players during non-fifa windows for qualifying)
logan_matthews9,charlotte is 16th but yes cavs are bad. that said theyve only scored over 226 three times in eight games - two of which were against the hawks who play at the fastest pace in the league (two were also with love)
adamchernoff,"thanks for all of the replies. 

collective agreement on kc between -7.5 and -9. hou was anywhere from pk to -4 nothing higher. essentially rating allen making his first playoff start (on the road) just slightly worse than watson at home. interesting."
adamchernoff,from a price and future outlook perspective (two key words being price and future outlook when reading this tweet) the eagles are the best team in the nfc and should be in every bettors account if n overtime already at 16/1  22/1.
adamchernoff,"in the offseason i keep notes on teams and thoughts on betting for the upcoming year.

 decided the notes were worth publishing. we worked together to put up a l assit minute nfl 2019 betting preview. i hope this brings you value."
adamchernoff,one such company i beta tested for in asia a while ago earned .05 percent  of the turnover they generated. even on high limit asian handicap markets priced to 101.5-102 percent  there is upside for the book to take bets from these.

Ccon8181,i count at le assit 4 of these games where i was on the chargers. good thing rivers threw 4 pics and fumbled (returned for  touchdown ) before half so i didnt have to sweat it verse the vikings l assit week
Ccon8181,mullen called a fake punt on own 15... didnt get it. riley likes to run 3 straight and punt when he has double digit lead. had to sweat both #florida and #oklahoma tonight but they both cash for a solid 4-1 day.
Ccon8181,with the way things have been going i guess ill take the push a free throw er miss st sle point  through first half. didnt catch a call down he stretch... still a solid day  on deck. gonna grind out profit today
Ccon8181,right! even a free throw er getting back to back touchdowns called back that missed chip sh overtime  field goal  was the difference. then msu going for it on own 45 and bama getting longest  field goal  like you said. just brutal.
Ccon8181,there have been some false accusations going around that the sec has pending charges against contrarian. contrarian investments signed off on an judgement with no penalty and acknowledgement to file exem point ions for investors going forward. contrarian is currently in compliance!
kellyinvegas,yoooo chill. this is a friendly contest amongst myself and the social guys. if you bet every single game on the board its time to stop gambling. i only bet about 12 bowl games this year and very kindly shared with everyone.
ToddFuhrman,"bad beat was alamo bowl; had oregon for a kings ransom and watched them completely crater without vernon adams

was in attendance and because the alamo bowl was a dump couldnt get cell rece point ion to bet tcu back at half"
ToddFuhrman,here's the difference...the epl embraces that model allowing clubs with the funds to build power houses; i'd be fine with that in the nfl because the bottom couldn't tank if they knew the relegation trapdoor was always there to keep them honest
ToddFuhrman,"monday night football  show  let us  go!   is back with a fresh episode recapping week 2 and an in-de point h #clevsnyj  preview from the incomparable  

 joined to tell no fans exactly how long the drew brees injury will keep him sidelined"
ToddFuhrman,"psa to all sportsbooks out there (new and old):

when listing games in any sport on  years old you are apps use rotation order; makes life significantly easier than the random placement of games by time stamp meant to lure recreational bettors"
ToddFuhrman,shane was awesome and we can only hope he'll join us for the us open as well and i'll promise n overtime to steal his tiger woods putting st against the spread next time if th against the spread what it takes
ToddFuhrman,"always fun jumping on with you boys and thomas thanks for the kind words.  

now if the jox decides to move the roundtable up again to say 3am pacific we might need a pre-tape or i'll be sending breakf assit invoices ha"
ToddFuhrman,because if you cave here what's nest...preseason nfl intl soccer friendlies etc.   it is  just n overtime a good look and unless they have compelling data or are willing to make a case publicly to support this sounds like a power play

12Xpert,but traders at these bookies  daily fantasy sports  come cheap and that is because they are really good at setting lines probably many were sharp players before encouraged to jump sides. hence their opening lines will be hard to beat (on average).
12Xpert,"this sounds like the classic remoaner argument. you forg overtime ""stupid"".

when will you understand that telling people they are these things is precisely the reason boris is still prime minister. they are sick of  years old you are shit like this."
12Xpert,"anticipating the ""guardian reader"" backlash here. i'll simply say if you can show me examples of moral prohibition solving other societal addictions then i'll give you some time. we should be in the business of problem solving n overtime ideological truth sermonising."
12Xpert,almost no one is actually good.  that is  n overtime saying no one is good. but it is saying it is hard to find those who are and the journey to them will likely involve loss making unless you are very lucky.
12Xpert,"still only 1/113 n overtime 1/500.
but why are we trading insults? with 57 percent  you're one of the best handicappers in the world. why haven't i heard about you before? and where's my invite to  years old you are beach party?"
12Xpert,i think the best thing that ever happened to me was my first attem point  at implementing a system with real money started with 8/10 losses. i g overtime cold feat and abandoned it. i've been a sce point ic ever since.
12Xpert,of course you could check whether you're beating closing prices and/or causing prices movements. with so free throw books happy to post inefficient opening prices and their willingness to ban customers these movements are a certainty for those who exploit such prices.
12Xpert,"replace ""market efficiency"" with ""vig"" and  that is  basically my and rufus' position which matthew disagrees with. yes some players will lose more than the vig indeed some more than 2 x vig but this imo will be down to bad luck."
12Xpert,[1/2] you presumed that i thought  years old you are contributions were neutral to negative. i have never thought that (although sometimes i find it hard to unpick what you're saying probably because you know a l overtime more than i do).
12Xpert,perhaps if the industry spent more time being honest and open with its customers it would gain more respect and less of a reputation for screwing both problem gamblers and would-be sharps in different ways. and perhaps then less need for regulations.
12Xpert,casinos manage just fine. players know they can win only by being lucky but are still happy to play. why can't it be the same with sports if bookmakers refuse to allow skill (in the same way casinos publicly refuse card counters)?
12Xpert,yes you'r right. going to be effectively impossible to test. perhaps the easiest way would be for  to published closing market probabilities based on the same information available to the bookmakers and everyone else. still my hunch is that they will fail.
12Xpert,why am i going too far? you haven't set out a case. we agree that there are a small percentage of bettors who will show true +ev. i happen to think that figure at a book like pinny is probably 1 percent
12Xpert,"good effort. i think it implies it sucks relative to pinny. isn't this further support for wisdom of crowd? ok so we might be simply talking ""crowd of pinny traders plus some sharp customers"" but  it is  still considerably bigger than 538."
12Xpert,he also explained why you shouldn't turn causality on its head and assume that if you have found a pattern from retrospectively dredging data that its existence proves it had a reason for happening. he called the people who do that fools.
JambosPicks,the guarantee is for the dates listed on the package you are looking to purchase.all packages run on a tuesday-monday schedule so if you purchase on a sunday for the following week it would be for the 7 days starting that tuesday.
mschwimer,the jambos podcast.  we were tiny during ncaa basketball season.  o you are first episode of this football season drops on thursday! can be found on  spotify itunes and google play.  we break down games with analysis from o you are models.
mschwimer,its the exact opposites of what touts do. if vegas dave offered me +230 on identical terms im offering i would bet at le assit $1m into that. but no tout has ever backed picks up with money exce point  for us.
mschwimer,i would say he has to prove he believes what he says. but that is just my opinion. again im more than happy if he no longer believes it and wants to take it back. would be no hard feelings at all.
mschwimer,went 7-0 yesterday including marlins  moneyline +210 and baltimore  moneyline +160! up 8.75 units on the day.  feels good to break out of the biggest slump in jambos history with authority!!!  have 8 plays up on the site now.  free for everyone
RufusPeabody,"this tweet is in honor of the people ive seen in sportsbooks complaining about hitting 7 legs of an 8-teamer: 

you are n times more likely to hit all but one leg of an n-leg parlay than to hit every leg."
RufusPeabody,"i'm going to call the difference between my contextualized/weighted yards/play margin and ""raw"" ypp ""hidden ypp"". here are the teams with the greatest net hidden ypp (i.e. undervalued by raw ypp):
1) lar
2) sf
3) ne
4) kc
5) hou"
RufusPeabody,this is a really good overview of the problems with the tout industry and the issues that regulation efforts face. one thing n overtime explored is the legal system. could a tout be held liable (criminal or civil) for false advertising?
RufusPeabody,a friend of mine (n overtime  tried to bet a us open tournament matchup at  they took $26.60. they may promise to take $10k on game days in big markets but they certainly  daily fantasy sports  take bets on anything else!
RufusPeabody,my big pga championship fade... doesn't really exist. probably schauffele by a hair but no huge position against any one golfer. but i do have one golfer i have a much larger position on than anyone. that golfer is tommy fleetwood.
jeffma,my point i dont think she is also. shes just going to tow the corporate line that shes been fed and i generally believe that she has n overtime dug into that side of the business enough to know the difference
jeffma,you should study decision science. the idea that a coach should do nothing to put his team in a position to lose the game is classic loss aversion. a coach should make decisions to maximize his teams decisions to win games

capjack2000,"njdge decides which sports are permitted. they recently permitted certain esports tournaments. they denied my petition to allow betting on jeopardy goat. 

the pricing of derivative markets is largely algorithmic. some shops prefer n overtime to butter the bread that thinly."
capjack2000,"with most of these euro firms the decision is quick. a few dozen bets.

other operators have an positive expected value threshold measured against clv. 

the problem is its a one-way decision.  years old you are fate is never reconsidered later."
capjack2000,"products like betconnect are making it less about recreational players competing with pros. 

products like sporttrade are making the interface much easier for a recreational player to identify value. 

mass market making via algos designed for low margin is seeding liquidity."
capjack2000,5 years ago svps sc debuted and he talked about the line bad be against the spread and winner$. it was amazing because the conversation was being furthered. he supported sports gambling because he was a realist and an adult.  thanks
capjack2000,"if you dont want to book my action fine i can work around you. however you owe it as a professional courtesy to book  action. 

show some respect to  years old you are own industry youre giving it a bad name."
capjack2000,"another slow mlb day. here's a free bet idea for sportsbooks:

instead of offering mlb salami betting (which gets cancelled with any rain out) offer a daily mlb average score. a rainout wouldn't affect the calculation. 
(runs scored) / (games completed)"
capjack2000,"they need to do some work on their vig especially on derivatives. 50-cent lines on those make me avoid the rest of their product on principle. 

hopefully that improves. i suspect the culprit there is sbtech but im n overtime positive."
capjack2000,"no fun allowed on my watch! 

seriously though sports wagering will eventually evolve into a trading market similar to any equity. people who blindly bet $20 on july oil prices arent just having fun. theyre making uninformed decisions with their money."
dinkinc,sports yes   racing with max rebate yes.  i am old school.  cant code.   cant properly model.  must stare at screen all day and write down data on a pad and then make an approximate line .. allows for very little life
robpizzola,wasnt a fan of allegri but sarri is making him look like the best manager of all time. berna cant play this role behind the strikers. pjanic as a regista is way too predictable and midfield just lacks creativity in general.
robpizzola,would be curious to see if you could run this at one ho you are before puck drop as well (i doubt it). there seems to be a whale in the market that regularly blows things up close to game time.
robpizzola,i'm guessing that a l overtime of people bet the flyers this a free throw ernoon thinking that they were playing a home game and are gonna be pretty surprised when they see this game being played in the czech republic.
robpizzola,i couldnt sleep more than fo you are hours a night before i started vaping cbd. now i sleep without any issues. might be a placebo might n overtime be. either way id recommend it to anyone who needs help relaxing.
robpizzola,these were the r1 results vs. pinny lines. could have swe point  the board with some game 7 luck but it wasnt meant to be. that vegas loss will haunt me for some time mainly because i was loaded with futures.
robpizzola,"the average person does n overtime quite realize how much variance there is in a hockey playoff series. 

yes tampa bay had one of the best regular seasons of all-time. no this is n overtime a once in a lifetime upset."
robpizzola,that is somehow one of the more believable parts of this story. why wouldnt this guy just fire 85k on a roulette spin? why wouldnt this money be wired? why didnt he order the cash in advance? lots of unanswered questions.
robpizzola,you really have to admire how dumb these old coaches are. there is a massive difference between playing vegas or arizona/minnesota/colorado/chicago in the first round. can't imagine how anyone wouldn't want to do everything possible to win the pacific right now.
ProfessorShine,also im n overtime counting offshores who list an opener for marketing like  best of luck  others. many of lv openers are also done for marketing.  2  years ago westgate posted the 1st nba finals odds;  it was up for 15mins.

suuma810,the vikes have the worst run offense in the league. running the ball even more like on early downs wont help them but hurt their overall efficiency. flippo probably knows that but th against the spread n overtime what zim wants.
suuma810,you  daily fantasy sports  need a good run game to be good at play-action. his own qb just proved him that by going 7/9 on play-action attem points  for 9.8 ypa l assit week vs 7.6 ypa on all other dropbacks.

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,no this pdf is wholly useless unless: (1)  it is  an individual guarantee or guarantee secured by a first position lien in collateral; and (2) the t'sc's eliminate the mandatory venue provision.  otherwise  it is  just another useless piece of paper.
CizzlingSports,"you're totally lost right now re: documenting and presenting alleged p assit performance which is a real problem for an operation claiming to distinguish itself from other touts.

go back to the original question re: mlb roi and figure it out."
CizzlingSports,if you really want to flex comp  a subscri point ion so he can independently monitor and verify line availability and performance.  is indipsutably neutral and the most respected tracker available - far superior to outside auditors that dont understand betting.
CizzlingSports,"oh wow guess what  says betting $65k to win $300k is a good bet because you're getting better odds (+460!) than a current market price of +400 n overtime kidding here fam

remember this man wants to sell you betting pickz"
spanky,"yes this is correct.  

when you buy onto a number you turn a loss into a push saving you 110.  when you buy off of a number you turn a push into a win making you 100.

saving 110  making 100"
spanky,i like it adam but i'm looking for something someone could listen to or watch where they do n overtime know any of the players whatsoever.  it would be boring for many many people but i may enjoy filling the void...
PlusEVAnalytics,tip: before playing that 10 game parlay have an honest conversation with yourself about whether youll hedge that l assit game. yes? then make it a 9 game parlay. save some money and stress and dont give those assholes  the satisfaction.
PlusEVAnalytics,unproductive employment doesnt help the economy(otherwise wed all have government jobs breaking rocks for a living)but it does get politicians elected. so can democratic economies ever reach their full potential?maybe n overtime but its outweighed by the social benefits of democracy?
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont get the covering more combinations argument. its like buying all combinations in the lottery - it doesnt get you any more positive expected value and it still boils down to how likely you are to hold a unique combination.
aluckyaday,that is pretty much what casual horse racing punters do. they make random bets at best prices on oddschecker with bog. that is a + expected value strategy hence why if it is only what you do you will be restricted.
aluckyaday,seriously though facebook have always done this. n overtime just for political ads. they say it is the responsibility of the advertiser to ensure the content is correct/legal. counterfeit goods copyrighted tv untrue political ads.... facebook makes goolge look like saints!
aluckyaday,"philadelphia eagles at buffalo bills back buffalo bills -1.5
denver broncos at indianapolis colts back denver broncos +5.5 
carolina panthers at san francisco 49ers back san francisco 49ers -4.5
green bay packers at kansas city chiefs back kansas city chiefs +4.5"
aluckyaday,but some will be as  said be voided because some staff  daily fantasy sports  know why the system won't acce point  them. so there is also a p overtime of unreturned cash from voided bets customers  daily fantasy sports  know about.
aluckyaday,only if you back that horse if you back any others you will be getting value as they will be bigger than they should be. over time what you lose on the private information horse you will gain on the others.
aluckyaday,with such small edges on handicap bets those half points can make the difference between a winning or losing year. but there is a down side. taking lines out of line with everyone else will ultimately result in a useless account!
aluckyaday,yes. but o free throw en the response they pick from their list does n overtime match the question! if that happens their only response seems to be keep repeating it instead of realising they may have picked the wrong one!
theFirmAISports,"updated o you are public model to account for how terrible/great teams are this year (spreads now go to -23). also updated the team rankings thru week 2. 

test it out here:



#rst against the spread #shinyapp # moneyline #ai #sportsbetting"
theFirmAISports,i was able to post my season in review today. the nfl season went much better than i expected with o you are modeling. its the only sport we bet 100 percent  all season long and it paid off remarkably well.
joeytunes2,they dont even let me get my 500. i called mike personally to scream. i said if you want to use my info let me get my bet down. they openly admitted to only taking 20 percent  of my known accts.
joeyisaks,yes theres gotta be a way. wh against the spread funny is i have so many accounts i play by hand. and i get more b overtime texts from those then actual accounts i give to people who use a bot
EdMillerPoker,but this is my point. for the most part i dont think theyre being taken advantage of. if im a new bettor and i sign up at betmasters and deposit $500 and start plinking away specifically how am i being exploited?
EdMillerPoker,we're doing all the nfl today free on the site and check out a couple  college basketball  games also. the  college basketball  product is looking good and we're aiming for a full launch of it a little later in the season.
EdMillerPoker,"courses just in data science and machine learning. something along the lines of ""intro to data science in x"" where x is the language you chose. i took andrew ng's intro machine learning class at coursera and thought it was good."
EdMillerPoker,theres rarely any acknowledgement that putting the needs of others before  years old you are own is a big part of being an adult and living a quality life. spouse/partner children elderly parents friends others in the community in need etc
EdMillerPoker,they're n overtime paying overhead on a space/catering/whatever like they do for their other events. my guess is net-net they prob lose $ on the event but they won't lose a ton and they'll view it as way worth the expenditure.
EdMillerPoker,abusing trust is a trivial and widely effective way to gain an edge at everything so it amazes me how many people seem to think they're very clever for finding some secret lifehack when abusing trust is really all they're doing
GolcondaFund,"gotta love when intellectually dishonest folk conflate ideas to draw false comparisons -

travis: 'member what you said about chinese food though! g overtime ya bitch!

...come on dude be better than this."
nonrandomalpha,we can see that o you are strategy is most correlated with  but even then is only 70 percent . as expected we have only a 26 percent  correlation with the supercontest consensus and a negative correlation with the public consensus.
nonrandomalpha,i have no problem admitting when a handicap has been off...no point in refusing to acknowledge the current state of reality. were sports bettors n overtime delusional fanatics; i have no undying loyalty to these teams. just gotta get more accurate
nonrandomalpha,blindly arguing that gb is going to suck in the face of conflicting facts is the same as others blindly arguing that trubisky is going to suck in the face of conflicting facts - the latter of which infuriates bears fans.
nonrandomalpha,aj green reportedly sprained ankle his ankle will probably be limited throughout the entire preseason. he's turning 31 in 4 days gotta wonder if age is starting to catchup to him. for context dez bryant is 3 months *younger* than aj.
LeeSharpeNFL,i have futures on ne to win the super bowl and no to win the nfccg. i'm n overtime saying they're the favorites (i think ravens are/should be) but i do believe the market is underrating both ne's and no's chances.
LeeSharpeNFL,agree but understand to what degree? most people who see passer rating numbers  daily fantasy sports  know how to calculate it but they understand what  it is  trying to do. more widespread usage of  expected points added  can get it there.
LeeSharpeNFL,but seriously i was shocked at how aggressive the cousins signing was when it happened with the full guarantee and thought it was bad but now i think i was wrong. contract numbers are within reason and he's doing well there.
whale_capper,yeah p against the spread d overall could be wildly inflated due to poor quality opponents so far but over the l assit 16 games gilmore has been a standout in a dominant unit and his flexibility/versatility elevates the whole defense
whale_capper,let me reword that... when you have a top heavy team at the end of a dynasty like this wear and tear is part of the calculus so i dont think you can put an assit erisk on what tor did
whale_capper,i would recommend you open accounts at every offshore book and use bitcoin to move money from book to book as needed... the prices o point ions and utility at the offshores is such that they all have advantages and disadvantages
AndyMSFW,i like that.  and i think the thing that gets lost is  it is  very market dependant.  you can't make the same assum point ions and measurements when betting into nfl sides as you can betting h overtime dog contest props.
JoeyKnish22,if youre a religious man id suggest some deep prayer. if n overtime ive g overtime a meeting the with hawaiian boosters club this week to see what we can cook up and how much paying off the officiating might cost.
JoeyKnish22,the matchups arent particularly in their favor om n overtime a team that you want needing to pass down a few scores. but defense has been alright and if they can run it a bit should keep it within 3 scores.
JoeyKnish22,"nobody lies about game start times more than mls. and those fucks get me everytime. the tv guide says 7pm est. the score apps say 7. google says 7. the official site says 7. 

the game is kicking off at 730."
TheKostos,"tonight's  kicks off with the power ho you are at 6pm et sponsored by  

   and i will go through the entire nba/ college basketball  card and break down the games analyze the markets and dole out winners (we hope).

TheKostos,kinda wish shurm you are could have stuck around as oc but i know that would never happen (so please  daily fantasy sports  tweet me that). he's an awesome oc and would be great for jones just can't be a hc
LockyLockerson,theres a l overtime of interpreting here im just betting fewer games than usual th against the spread kinda all i meant? this seems more like trolling than anything though so i guess im just gonna block.  i dunno tough call.
LockyLockerson,ind-ten: we begin with one of the larger differences i make this titans by 2 and with 3.5's starting to pop in a few places i think  that is  valuable to grab with indy.  indy +3.5 if you can find one.
LockyLockerson,kind of interesting that michigan could win a game other teams could lose and michigan's price would go up to win the title (just re-opened +1950 at bm).  clearly people unhappy with what they're seeing from the wolverines thru 2 games.
LockyLockerson,etienne's amazing game also n overtime totally unexpected.  it also shows what an incredible brick taylor martinez threw up there with nebraska struggling against south alabama.  at the bottom a ton of injuries (which aren't predictable) and herbert going up (predictable)
LockyLockerson,also sometimes a stud like an nfl dra free throw ed player may n overtime actually have had meaningful production like you thought he would.  his dra free throw  status may have been based way more on potential or his combine.
DannyParkins,wow ju-ju crying on the field a free throw er the hit on mason rudolph who now somehow is standing and walking off albeit with some assistance. he was out cold. crazy violent game that no rule change can make safe.
DannyParkins,alright here we go. the danny parkins show gets going right now with week 1 in the books (this  sunday night football  game is a wrap). we begin with my one big thought on every team that played today.  sirius 206
DannyParkins,yea  that is  what everyone who listens to me says: that i  daily fantasy sports  prep shows. the 24 hours in the week that i'm on over 6 days that i just  daily fantasy sports  prep things. you g overtime me.
DannyParkins,"reporter: was that ball that kris bryant misplayed in the sun a byproduct of n overtime playing the outfield o free throw en?

joe maddon: it was a byproduct of the sun. whoever put it there i was really upset with."
DannyParkins,its impossible to have done a better job than dabos done with clemson so he deserves every penny but his cognitive dissonance on paying players when he gets this contract and goes to work in that facility is insulting to logic.
DannyParkins,if you think cnn which is one station and sinclair media group (which is a media group that owns more tv stations than any group in the us) are the same thing you're exactly as dumb as you appear to be.
Gingfacekillah,honestly n overtime too bothered by this one. if harden and paul hit their avg 3pm or even league average they cover the spread easily. some games are like that. reset for tomorrow. missing about 3 3pm or 9  points .
Gingfacekillah,the models in the book dont do great against major markets. however had some success with smaller markets. understanding the models and how they work was a really good base for coming up with  years old you are own ideas. recommended.
Gingfacekillah,correct. glmnet gave me a 3.5 percent  rsq boost which combined with pca and bootstrapping was i think the upper ceiling on linear models. so much of what were trying to model is nonparametric. like you said better solutions surely exist.
Gingfacekillah,if you regress actual margin of victory using closing line for a pointspread in nba for ex you get a slope value over 0 and a coefficient of less than 1 (0.95ish). seems to suggest closing line isnt perfectly efficient thoughts?
logan_matthews9,the only tout worth subscribing to. no one can move at market like ras. i was able to middle this is in minutes. took u154.5 -105 g overtime o152.5 even. limited to $500 for  college basketball  totals but still great value.
PikachuBets,"op i agree. being able to ""see"" things like this that others can't is the key reason you need to tout and spell words like ""pix"" and tweet about 6-1 trends in cfl as proof that you are a good ""capper"""
PikachuBets,also could you explain how most of nbl isnt journeyman americans with very little local talent? bc the local aus talent leaves for nba. rest of roster filled with random nba dropouts and i dra free throw ed  college basketball  players.
PikachuBets,if you're trying too talk two sum1 intelligently but he mixes up 3 homophones in a roe would you bee worried that he is just righting typos? of coarse kn overtime u would continue to assume he is a illiterate idiot.
adamchernoff,"nfl week 14 was exhausting...a free throw er a quick six ho you are ""nap"" overnight  and i are back looking at week 15 opening point spreads/totals  insight from the traders and one bet locked in with a total this morning."
adamchernoff,what brad is saying is sp overtime on and would be echoed by many across the industry. it is quite unusual to see a 7-8 week stretch in nfl with little correlation between line movement and success against the spread .
adamchernoff,"talking game state this morning on the podcast. what is it? how do you use it when handicapping nfl and why do 32 nfl teams o free throw en play like 96? 

plus the full market rundown a day before kickoff."
adamchernoff,betting percentages and money percentages can be extremely misleading. n overtime only do bookmakers facilitate a large percentage of secondary wagers (parlay/teaser) but looking at a blanket percentage does n overtime factor in price point n overtime differences between bookmakers (limits/margins).
adamchernoff,"said before betting should follow these steps:

1.) use method(s) to project probability 
2.) convert probability to price
3.) compare price to available market prices
4.) determine difference between projected price and best market entry price
5.) stake according to difference"
adamchernoff,everything above was quite basic. but i think a l overtime of it goes unnoticed when analyzing betting markets and judging positions being taken by bookmakers or positions being taken by influential bettors in the market and judging how bookmakers react.
adamchernoff,a white label is likely going to push for a  percent  of handle (speaking from experience using dgs). support staffing and management is more of a headache than anything but another $150k per year. then the float which depends on state.
adamchernoff,"get  years old you are saturday started with a big breakdown of both nfl division games this a free throw ernoon.  and i set you up for a big weekend on the  podcast:

ToddFuhrman,"exactly if it came from anyone else you'd see more speculative but knowing greg's ties there carries more weight...

whereas saying rodgers and lafle you are fought over a game of yahtzee on team plane harder to believe given sourcing ha"
ToddFuhrman,dont worry n overtime going for 2 became the le assit of his concerns when they elected to punt from the 39; all in they coached scared late and let the experienced team have a chance and lawrence took full advantage
ToddFuhrman,"sports gambling will test  years old you are patience self control perseverance math skills discipline reading comprehension emotions and resiliency

dont ever let it test  years old you are financial resources; always bet responsibly and within  years old you are means."
TheCousinSal,the  ho you are derby is soooo much better now that its timed. n overtime saying they should do this with regular season games but can they at le assit experiment with the idea every year for the next 30 years?
12Xpert,it might be that there's a reason why this should be a special case. certainly point of consum point ion taxes was applied to the offshore industry in such a way. i haven't seen this extended to the likes of amazon.
12Xpert,"(1/2) obviously n overtime the latter method. for example suppose both figures were 5/10 (0.5). multiplying gives you 25 percent  which intuitively would n overtime feel correct.
the first method is better but there is a wider issue in following this."
12Xpert,it is interesting. the pleasure apparently comes from the anticipation and is greatest with 50-50 uncertainties. but what precisely are we anticipating? the financial reward or something else? like being right about stuff. being right = ego defence = survivalist strategy.
12Xpert,"there are great stories in sport. and then there are fairytales.

an interesting series of threads speculating on mo farah and his connection to alberto salazar former trainer and today banned for doping athletes. as always ross tucker  has relevant perspective."
12Xpert,its really very simple and those looking to overturn that process on the grounds that they dont like it are disingenuous and anti democratic. the arguments they use to defend their position would never have been used for the opposite outcome.
12Xpert,presumably people who want to remain in the eu would never ask the question because they would always deny that it would be possible to n overtime fall off a cliff. just confirmation bias. behind a paywall. what did it conclude?
12Xpert,i actually agree with you about the eu parliament.  it is  elected to make decisions on o you are behalf in the same way that we elect a uk parliament. indirect democracy is clearly more practical than holding referendums on everything.
12Xpert,the strong clvh says you shouldn't be able to beat the closing line.  years old you are study proposition is an interesting one. as i understand it you're effectively saying greater opening line variance will correlate with greater closing line variance.
12Xpert,that will depend on numerous factors in particular the liquidity of the match you're betting on and when that liquidity is arriving. if most of it in the l assit 10 minutes then for sure things could change quite a bit.

mschwimer,going live on  in 5 minutes or so to talk with  and  going to talk about how dirty the tout industry is and how  will change it. also call out touts who refuse to put their money where their mouth is!
mschwimer,1st inning. votto on 2nd. 1 out. puig hits a misile up the middle for what looks to be a sure base hit. but 2nd baseman makes an insane play to catch the line drive and double up votto. tough beat
mschwimer,for baseball stat heads i strongly recommend the  podcast.  most recently had a podc assit relating to the predictability of pitching injuries.  unfortunately they g overtime a few things wrong.  i am happy to come on the podc assit to discuss!
RufusPeabody,you think jerry jones has ever considered making himself head coach? it makes so much sense. he wants a yes man. he has a huge ego. he wants all the credit. why n overtime be head coach gm and owner?
RufusPeabody,fyi  and i have been discussing plans for  and how much we want to disclose publicly this year. well do *something* but probably n overtime as much as p assit years. should have a decision in the next few days.
RufusPeabody,and you wouldn't solve the survivorship bias problem -- a tout could have a series of sites where he/she gives out completely different picks. they're able to tout the performance of the one that happens to by chance perform well.
SportsCheetah,neither could  but generally down 18 you have to take the  field goal s from 30 yards or whatever to make it a two-score game. granted that kid missed one 40 yards wide earlier in the game so who knows.
SportsCheetah,the turning point came in a bahamian piano bar back in august. during the wolves three-day getaway to the bahamar resort on the island of nassau in the bahamas saunders and rosas wanted a heart-to-heart chat with the 24-year-old wiggins.
SportsCheetah,riley nelson did play through it (until he couldnt any longer and taysom hill made his debut). and shout out to byu football in 2012 when you could bet unders every week and retire until you bet the hawaii game.
capjack2000,"first they set their regulations and then being taking applications for licenses. they will have to approve licenses and verify technology. i think early summer is a realistic target.

they need to pay for the information theyre given dont steal it.

capjack2000,"the dumpster fire rolls on. 

a better way to combat illegal gambling would be to put out a legal product that is more competitive and more convenient than the black market. 

instead well waste money and police resources hunting snipes."
capjack2000,"fanduel started the trend with fading barstool picks. pointsbet has picked up on it. foxbet needs to embrace this with their insufferable talking heads. 

reminds me of the uk product betconnect where you can back or fade pros and touts."
capjack2000,you dont have to make picks every week. you just make 70 picks between now and the end of the season. a l overtime of people seemed to try to pick every game on the schedule in the first week.
capjack2000,"i think it can be done for as cheaply as $20m. probably more like $60-80m to be done with the best of the best lawyers partnerships so free throw ware and staffing. 

glad you included  he's o you are bankroll."
capjack2000,i like these guys. they're a couple of real bettors showing their real passion for the business. if you're betting in nj pa ny this is a good listen each week. production quality is high too which is always appreciated.
capjack2000,"to those eligible...this is a good deal. be careful in that pointsbet has been known to restrict promos for those who play exclusively promos or are deemed sharp. 

my advice:  daily fantasy sports  be afraid of variance on this play."
capjack2000,"you need to contact njdge and file a complaint. under nj regulations an operator can n overtime unilaterally change a bet a free throw er it has been placed without dge approval. 

here is a link to the complaint form:"
dinkinc,thursday se point  19th.....  three of my favorite things....  the running of the little brown jug at delaware ohio .....  playing a gig in my home city........ the opening round of   battle of los angeles....  it is  amazing and horrible
dinkinc,if only vince had the balls to change the finish while watching the murphy-roman match and put murphy over clean...it would have created an instant star and taught the viewers they cant take the results of a match for granted
dinkinc,standards need to be the same for every race.  but the game needs to be fan friendly as well. bad calls based on important races are ass backwards .. like the saints-rams pass interference.  a foul is a foul.  period
robpizzola,the great thing about a game like wmu/wku is that n overtime a single person on twitter lost. everyones a winner. wku -2.5 and wmu +3.5 tickets everywhere. impressive bet timing from everyone to get the best of the number.
robpizzola,pjanic *could* be world class but he will never be world class playing as a holding midfielder. he needs to be further up the pitch. emre can could probably fill that holding midfielder sp overtime if sarri didn't hate him.
robpizzola,i'll give the patriots the benefit of the doubt on this one because i can't imagine a world in which belichick is willing to admit that his team is so bad that they have to cheat to beat the bengals.
robpizzola,can someone explain why the bears dont always run a hurry-up offense? seems like th against the spread the only time that mitch is actually effective in any capacity (aside from running sideways when he has a clear first down).
robpizzola,funny that youre calling me an idi overtime when o you are first ever interaction was in regards to the probability of two ties happening in an nfl season. you were only a tiny bit off there if you recall.

just sign up for a trial membership to get access for the trial section!"
suuma810,agree. the league-wide conversion rate between 30  40 is 68 percent  on 4th  1 since 2000. we would expect this kc offense to convert 80 percent + easily. but n overtime with an under center run into a stacked box.

-strong interior rush vs #vikings putrid ol.
-mike pettine vs first-year play caller john defillippo in his 2nd game.

suuma810,took broncos -3 +100 over -2.5 -120. edge on den with great hfa markets haven't caught up to seahawks turnover. felt line was too short. den moved the ball sea needed big plays. keenum with some dumb mistakes. pushed happens.
ClevTA,phew. was really nervous my followers would stone me if i g overtime this jameis thing wrong. i personally started and recommended philip over jameis to anyone who asked. its his final home gm what could possibly go wrong tomorrow
ClevTA,i dont understand this tweet at all. i was disagreeing with lima saying going for it was unorthodox. i was saying bc of the wind that kicking wasnt even an o point ion. going for it was the only choice
ClevTA,so is ramsey going to intentionally ole tackles so he doesnt get hurt? why in the world is he playing tonight? if im the jags id sit him bc i dont want that guy playing while trying to avoid contact
ClevTA,of course u take it with a grain of salt but i thought rudolph looked pretty good yesterday. he already throws a great deep ball. moncrief taking the ball to his face was the only reason he threw an int
CizzlingSports,(2/x)the report and assertions are both dated 2/19/19. its n overtime clear thus whether the auditor merely rubber-stamped the assertions or actually audited 935 individual plays for availability and performance which seems like it would take more than a day.

spanky,my son plays little league. if he was in the same situation and smiled i woulda been upset with him. whatever happened to hang  years old you are head low and just walk off.  smiling is disrespectful in my opinion.
spanky,"harrahs telling chris he can have 20k but when he tries to bet it they only give him 2k.  

reading this is deja vu. harrahs did the exact same thing to me. i went from 10k to 500... (see below)."
spanky,if you make it -1600 then would you lay -1200? would you lay -1000? i would lay neither..  on the contrary i would take +2000 on something i make +1600...  for me minimizing risk/reward ratio trumps exclusively looking at +ev.
spanky,my compliments have nothing to do with getting higher limits.  i live in nj!  fyi they gave me a dime on hoop totals when i was there l assit month.  but i gave them several big nfl plays to reciprocate.
spanky,i have no idea what he does th against the spread his business.  what i do know is bill has been a pro for years and does n overtime need to sell picks.  he is well respected in the industry.

aluckyaday,you  daily fantasy sports  need accounts with all books. if the books you have are n overtime top price  daily fantasy sports  bet. pretty simple + expected value strategy. you only need one so free throw  book to employ it.
aluckyaday,i think that was the original question. if the price has changed between it going in the database and it being displayed to a level where the bet no longer meets the required edge is it removed from the recommendations?
aluckyaday,world war 2 le free throw  the uk a bankru point  nations. it had to be bailed out by the usa. it took 60 years to pay off the debt. how much will a usa bailout cost us this time?
aluckyaday,you probably know i dispute that. n overtime that they are less sharp on the opening but the reason for it. i'm n overtime going to go through my arguments again as you seem to know my previous tweets well.
aluckyaday,according to paris smith pinnacle test their new traders by giving them 3 bets at a so free throw  book. if they are n overtime shu touchdown own a free throw er the 3rd bet they go back to training!
aluckyaday,why would sharp money be more influential if it is only 10 percent  of the handle? i guess it would depend on what is limiting the sharp money. would they bet more if the books did n overtime move lines?
aluckyaday,exactly. but if closing lines are n overtime individually efficient and you have information that allows you to identify that inefficiency you can make money at clv. so beating closing line value is n overtime required to be profitable .
aluckyaday,i find it more interesting to listen to what marco blume says to data scientists about the company and how they use their models. its n overtime just for setting opening prices but integral to the process of moving lines.
aluckyaday,or maybe its about brand awareness. i would think the brands that  daily fantasy sports  have a high street presence would be at a significant disadvantage when trying to recruit new customers if they could n overtime advertise on tv.

EdMillerPoker,"the difference is that suspended markets are greyed out and  it is  communicated transparently to the customer that bets aren't offered or acce point ed during that time.

if a market is live/n overtime greyed then there are zero rejections."
EdMillerPoker,"i never see it mentioned in these convos but what it means to ""own equity"" in a corporation (esp a large public corporation) always seems to be taken for granted as immutable and never probed for revisions to the rules."
EdMillerPoker,since my followers either are bots or own cry point o this is my periodic reminder that usg will ban conversion to usd the moment it suits them and previous precedent for this action is everything usg has ever done
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i dont know of any substantial evidence to support this particular bearishness. of course i suppose its possible but to me it makes no sense and also flies against available (to me at least) evidence.
EdMillerPoker,"you wouldn't want to bet that way.  that is  just the math to figure out what the theoretical hold percentage is in a market.  that is  the ""how much do i lose if i throw darts at this bet?"" amount."
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  fell way short of projected growth for a number of reasons but imo in large part because average players who just want to pick some players and sweat the games get crushed due to the game design.
EdMillerPoker,i agree with that. content that looks like already existing sports media but just with more of a bent towards betting i think will thrive. nuts and bolts reporting on market movement etc tho im very ske point ical of.
EdMillerPoker,"yeah that whole thing is a sym point om of a bigger problem... which happens to be partly at the core of the ""underperformance."" obv  point that all these projections are puffed up for political reasons is also very valid"
EdMillerPoker,"but the design principles apply to all gambling games. most ""innovation"" in sports betting (imo) ignores most or all of these principles and focuses on how to meet operator needs like higher short term hold/volume or marketing (""differentiation"" and ""branding"")"
EdMillerPoker,over and over i hear ppl targeting roughly the same customer. and it makes sense because in the gold rush phase that customer will be v profitable. but over the long term that customer will be relatively expensive to acquire.
nonrandomalpha,granted this is a different ravens team on both o and d this year...the huge blowout in spread and heavy public action may make ravens a hold-your-nose and bet it kind of play - but hard to pull the trigger.
LeeSharpeNFL,it makes sense why people consider 2 yards on a running play an ok outcome now.  you start from 1st and 10 but  that is  in passing yards.  it is  only 1st and 5.49 once you convert to rushing yards.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm n overtime saying  it is  an eye test. dunno if you listen to the bet the process podc assit (if n overtime i recommend) but rufus peabody has been modeling the committee's rankings and found  it is  quite inconsistent.

LeeSharpeNFL,really was even before this week. and  it is  gonna be hard for the eagles a free throw er losing today. the good news for eagles fans is that their schedule outside of the remaining game vs. dal is easy.
LeeSharpeNFL,if you define it so that  it is  personal than how can anyone know about anyone else's mental state? someone watching a game can't know the confidence level of someone. but yet pundits do this all the time (and shouldn't).

LockyLockerson,i  daily fantasy sports  think i've bet army once this year and was pretty sure we'd reached a nice bottom for them to buy into against this team.  and  it is  7-0 before i blink.  sounds like my season lol.
LockyLockerson,"maybe by the time we get to ""widely-available bets"" friday night it will be less wrong and i  daily fantasy sports  have to give it out to everyone! that'd be neat since i'm n overtime sure florida's actually very good."

LockyLockerson,friendly reminder: you do n overtime need a kindle to read the book.  kindle is a free app you can download and when you buy the book on amazon it will go there.  works on every type of phone/tablet/everything.  thanks!
LockyLockerson,a second graphic: here's how many times a win total has closed at a specific value since 2010 and how teams have done over/under-wise vs. that number.  most samples are way too small to draw conclusions but still kinda interesting.
DannyParkins,i said it the day the new pass interference rule was announced it was a gross overreaction to the nfc title game and there would be huge unintended consequences. read this from  and tell me how this possibly goes well.
chadmillman,plenty of injury rumors around justify.  mlb all star and now crack reporter called bob baffert who responded when i tell you the horse is ready to go hes ready to go. ill see you in new york. full story.
Gingfacekillah,you can extend this spreadsheet to calculate totals/puckline spreads as well. le free throw  these elements out of the download so as n overtime to overly complicate the example sheet - but i would encourage you to experiment with it.
Gingfacekillah,i dont really bet mm or  daily fantasy sports  but they share something in common: ownership  percent  is extremely important. the forecasting of brackets must be something like win  percent  * projected ownership percent  in order to find value imo.
Gingfacekillah,anecdotal but what little time i've spent on tennis leads me to believe the upper tier markets are wickedly efficient. did some work with markov chains that looked promising but the sport is eminently forecastable. for you and the books.
Gingfacekillah,just started learning r day 3. st against the spread background but other than the odd ht moneyline page no functional programming background. a little intimidated by the learning curve given the complexity of the things i want to do.
logan_matthews9,only thing i added was some dj first round +1400. the math likes him anyways but hes also been prepping for this event for a while - playing the first round dec 26th. i like him to come out strong
logan_matthews9,what if pinny is consistently over/undervaluing a team? you are just getting bias by comparing to them instead of market. youre implying that by having high limits pinnacle is always the sharpest book. th against the spread just inherently false.
logan_matthews9,guyana was even over 90 minutes? in what universe? and historically the us has n overtime run through the group stage like you seem to think they should. so either every other team wasnt good or this one did well.
logan_matthews9,personally playing pulisic centrally is way more of a playing someone out of position issue but no one seems to care? just reminds me of youth coaches who just put their best players centrally and worst out wide just because
logan_matthews9,im always fascinated to see loan players - especially winter loanees- take the arm band. miazga might have fallen behind long for the #usmnt but being ca point ain for reading when hes been there for three months is noteworthy

12Xpert,his 8th and 9th tweets are more most interesting and certainly warrant testing. in my view the only way you can force companies to n overtime pass on tax increases to consumers and workers is to either legislate or nationalise.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  have access to punters' spending and if i asked bookmakers wouldn't give me that data. but from the presence of the favourite-longsh overtime bias some people have inferred that punters must overbet longshots n overtime favourites.
12Xpert,why are you trying to retrofit causal explanations to patterns you see? now if you'd proposed a reason why bettors were going to behave differently in 2015 on the 31st december 2014 then this would be worth paying attention to.
12Xpert,betfair are now offering exchange customers 2 percent  commission rate provided they give up best odds guarantee and other promotions. for sharper customers who'll get banned for profitably exploiting those that seems like a good deal. what am i missing?
12Xpert,this from an individual who makes a living from the losses of others. just as interesting. by all means  let us  debate the morals of gambling.  let us  see if we can manage it without resorting to argumentum ad hominem.
12Xpert,n overtime sure what the argument was here but i think  it is  still important to highly the cul-de-sacs that data mining can take you down if you're careful how you use it. these two quotes should do the job.
12Xpert,if the code says gambling shouldn't be linked to enhanced sexual attractiveness the you shouldn't be promoting  years old you are brand with deals who are obviously attractively above average.  simply  daily fantasy sports  use images of people at all.
12Xpert,now  let us  do it the other way around. this time we assume  odds are the measure of truth and the hypothesis now is that real  odds / 538 odds should predict actual roi. here's how it looks this time.
12Xpert,are you actually going to bother doing some follow up research investigating the success of this #betregret campaign? for sure i  daily fantasy sports  expect a response to this since public dialogue doesn't seem to be in the job spec.

RufusPeabody,regarding  and their wd policy i want to clarify that i wasnt tricked in any way. they told me up front. i was just kinda dumbfounded is all. also want to thank them for raising my limits. much appreciated.
RufusPeabody,against square line? i  daily fantasy sports  know the exact number but sure. but we're talking about a two-way market and as soon as you start betting underdogs and unders at bovada the square line ceases to be available.
RufusPeabody,check roulette. very different. you gamble on the sum of the digits of the bottom line of the check. everyone takes numbers 0-9. for example $129.18 would be 21 so whoever had the 1 would pay the whole bill.
RufusPeabody,anyone who read  coverage of parlay patz could tell you he had a serious gambling problem. and this is the road it led him down. maybe the media should practice some moral responsibility before giving problem gamblers a platform.

zero. point. six.

they had 15 (!) such runs and only three went for 5+ yards."
suuma810,"on their first touchdown drive the #vikings called five dropbacks for 56 yards  two runs for 10 yards.

zimmer probably went to stefanski and said: ""calm down bro.""

on their next drive they called a run on 2nd  17."
suuma810,"absolutely but th against the spread n overtime how most bettors think.

but even if people want to bet against the market move they shouldnt make an  sunday night football  bet only depending on a free throw ernoon results."
suuma810,and will cost $7m over the next three years plus the 5th year o point ion. that should easily be worth a first-round pick. if im a team like the bengals or giants i would grab my phone asap.
suuma810,according to reports at the time it was all about barkley. gettleman said something like: a free throw er the browns took mayfield i told o you are guys we take barkley. we are going to run the ball.
ClevTA,totally disagree. the reason home court matters in any sport is travel and unfamiliarity with surroundings. has aboslutely zero to do with crowd noise. come on brendan u are supposed to be sharp u can't possibly think this way
ClevTA,i dont trust that guy. his offense has been antiquated for years. most of these coaches are so stuck in their ways that its hard to imagine he will have changed. i think there are far more better candidates
ClevTA,its a good question and i wasn't necessarily saying these numbers are totally predictive. just that i was surprised that  it is  been going on for a long while now. could be adjustments by the defenses n overtime sure
CizzlingSports,imagine if clarence darrow here put a minute of research and/or thought into and about ohio law oh wait  that is  n overtime as much as fun as snap-riling up (no less than) 788 low-iq's into 's and lykes

spanky,"for those who attended  hoboken event with  and myself did you guys get anything out of it? honesty is appreciated. saying it sucked is super cool.  

for those that missed it would you consider attending if it was closer?"
spanky,the thing that impressed me the most with  is their distribution of a printed house limit sheet.  clear limits per sport for side/tot/ml. this may seem like a no-brainer but no regulated sportsbook in the united states has this.
spanky,i thought you liked me for me n overtime for my generosity  ill be out of the country for most of the summer in france then costa rica. sloan and jersey conferences seem to be the only 2 staples.

PlusEVAnalytics,and th against the spread where the story ends. its been 23 hours. the photo is still there. the user is still active. no response to my follow up emails. to say im disappointed in  would be an understatement.
PlusEVAnalytics,i guess if they move the line between  years old you are first $10 and  years old you are second that might n overtime be a great outcome for you. i take back what i said. it is dumb.
PlusEVAnalytics,researching it and as long as its financially reliable it seems like a great o point ion for bettors. but why would books sign up for this practically begging to be arbed and pay a commission for the privilege?
PlusEVAnalytics,i apologize for using the term frequentist tendencies. i have the utmost respect for frequentists. it was a heat of the moment response and p0.05 is a perfectly reasonable standard for impossible no matter the context. again i apologize.
aluckyaday,the problem i have with recreational sharps calling for restrictions to be banned means books will become much sharper pinnacle/cris clones but with more vig. they won't be able to beat them so they will be no better off!
aluckyaday,thanks but i did n overtime want to know the theoretical max draw down but what the actual maximum draw down would have been had i used a different staking plan for the selections in my lucky. thread here.
aluckyaday,i think you are underestimating the size of the recreational market. recreational punters are n overtime betting to win they are betting for entertainment. fantasy sports makes watching a game more entertaining. so does having a multiple prop bet.
aluckyaday,same with unconditional offers. there are so many brilliant kids out there they  daily fantasy sports  care if they pass their a levels. we want their brilliance at o you are university. again nothing to do with tuition fees
aluckyaday,yep. but that is what recreational players want. that and dopamine . a bigger issue the us will have to face and i have n overtime heard it mention much in us commentary is that dopamine is very addictive.
aluckyaday,exactly. and if regulation forced books to acce point  all bets lines would become much much sharper overnight. they would lower limits and copy pinny lines with increased margins. bad for everyone exce point  the sharpest of the sharp.
aluckyaday,normal for a european online book. you are profiled and given an individual stake factor depending on how they see you. the stake factor is a percentage of the current market limit so different people can bet different amounts.
aluckyaday,i would think they will welcome him with open arms. so free throw books like william hill  daily fantasy sports  ban winners contrary to popular opinion that is n overtime their model. they ban people who take value prices.

EdMillerPoker,"anyway i'm very proud of what we're building. we have launched three products now with demonstrated real-world real betting-market success for all three.

EdMillerPoker,obv i pretty strongly agree with dustin here. real in-play is coming. exactly how it finds its way into the industry is tbd but once it has a foothold i feel like it will become standard offering v quickly.
EdMillerPoker,on the industry side this is of course about legacy systems and again its why an operator who invests in platform and pricing can build a lasting advantage for themselves on ux and branding. esp so in the us.
EdMillerPoker,the way industry currently runs operators have opposed interests to leagues data media etc etc. operators goal is to soak as much as possible from the shared customer base while paying as little as possible to the other parties.
EdMillerPoker,owning the gambling part (and building it out right) would increase the value of the streaming live sports potentially significantly. this is the reason i've thought in the p assit amazon had an outside sh overtime to get involved

LeeSharpeNFL,was hoping he might be available for the bears to pick up for next year at le assit as a bridge but i think he's played too well for the titans to n overtime have him start next year.
LeeSharpeNFL,the problem with time of possession is it correlates with how much you run which in turn correlates with game scri point  so  it is  a biased data set when trying to use it as a predictor for winning.
LeeSharpeNFL,confidence isn't measurable but momentum is. we can measure whether success on recent plays is predictive of success on the next plays a free throw er controlling for other factors. people have and the answer is that it doesn't.
AndyMSFW,most of it is done in the off-season and adjustments for me are done lightly and with prudence.  i am less model heavy in the nfl than in other sports but still think pricing everything out yourself is important.
AndyMSFW,working on nfl might have another play or two for tomorrow.  i'm n overtime all that versed in college ball though.  please tell me what to do today. ufc soccer tennis baseball and jai alai picks count too. #hatelike

DannyParkins,of course not. but he could have said it wasn't a legal issue when asked. no one is saying privacy doesn't matter or hippa shouldn't be respected etc just that when you indicate nothing it allows for negative speculation.
DannyParkins,really well researched story by  on the bears throwback jerseys theyll wear twice this year to the 1936 season which was one of 12 seasons the nfl didnt allow black players and george halas likely role in that ban.

Gingfacekillah,2/n the numbers and information coming out of china about a month ago were concerning and appeared (to me) to be ominous.  i began making reasonable pr expected points added rations based on the following ad hoc risk assessment.
Gingfacekillah,it is  n overtime the standard elo function. read my explanation in the comments.  it is  a  percent  points share which changes the k parameter range. if you want to change it to the standard elo formula feel free.
Gingfacekillah,some games are like that. time to stick a pylon in the net and play post post crossbar. cant really laugh though...a center that averages 8.2 assists a game has 1 a free throw er 3 quarters for me....lol
Gingfacekillah,true. however phi is packed with high end sh overtime takers and distributors so if embiid gets into foul trouble you can expect his usage to go down. main matchup against vucevic leans my way. i guess well see.
Gingfacekillah,yeah true! i  daily fantasy sports  play  daily fantasy sports  but i've g overtime him penciled in at ~15 (n overtime fp)  points  tonight in 25-26 min. he'd be an under pick for me because of the blowout potential.
Gingfacekillah,the data is about 800 games. you are correct these are marginals n overtime model residuals. i'll go back and read more of  years old you are writings until i have more intelligent questions  thank you for the help!
Gingfacekillah,sure! there are different ways to remove the vig from book prices to get the implied true probabilities. some are better than others. for 2-outcome events id recommend the logarithmic method. for 3-way bets id recommend the shin method.
Gingfacekillah,lak for sure ari  van wont make it top 5 spots decided by +/- 2 games. edm can plausibly compete for #2 in div even #1 if cal drops the ball. goal differential alone shows a wide open division.
logan_matthews9,"thanks for the anecdote. now do the math on the times that happens historically and get back to me

this why no one takes you seriously by the way. anecdotal evidence of a betting strategy is a losing one"
logan_matthews9,the if he did that in public hed be jail argument is so stupid. if i go and tackle some dude on the street im probably going to jail too - even if i have perfect form. nonsensical argument
logan_matthews9,at this point it seems as though his system just isnt realistic to implement at the international level. to  years old you are point he needs to piv overtime to a new idea but seems uninterested in doing so.
logan_matthews9,as a final thought im up 6 percent  so far this season. my current crop of clubs that seem undervalued are orlando city and ne revs. overvalued are road favorites (in no league is home field advantage more prevalent)

adamchernoff,obvious one here. their  podcast is bunched in with the vsin best bets but anyone in a car with sirius must listen to  and  in the morning. they are the bar for the industry. relatable professional and always informative.
adamchernoff,another big day of college hoops for members of the simple handicap slack channel with winners on purdue -12 (won by 35) and ucf +7.5 (win outright by 5). another example of what gets posted in the channel below.

Ccon8181,by all means fade away. theres a reason i can risk 10k per wager. if i was negative expected value long term i couldnt sustain that. we all have bad runs. just keep that same energy a going forward.
Ccon8181,between #pac12refs and their phantom holding calls and #stanford hc david shaw calling runs into a 9 man front every first down. ill take them up by 3 at half. letting it ride but recommend buying off a bit.

TheCousinSal,g.o.t. spoiler: as adorable as the couples dragon-ride was i give this episode a solid 5. i know they have to re-set all the pl overtime lines but with only 5 episodes le free throw  shits gotta move faster.
TheCousinSal,note to america. its totally okay to admit while it would be nice to see tiger win that overall youre bored watching middle aged men golfing in the drizzle for 6 hours.  its cool.  im here for you. #masterssunday
12Xpert,i know i know. as a red i just cant help enjoying  years old you are civil war. good luck tonight. youll probably win coz like l assit season we have more important trophies to worry about eh  ?
12Xpert,maybe at the same time we end up with fewer gambling addicts. gambling is a natural part of life like eating and drinking. all of those things taken to excess in one way or another aren't good for us.
12Xpert,and more reasons to be concerned the  is only waging a moral crusade against gambling rather than to actually offer positive comment about the role gambling might play in helping people become better decision makers in domains of uncertainty.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  profess to be a smart arse so yes this is the best system i know. if i was a smart arse i wouldn't be wasting my time on twitter. what's the best system you know?
12Xpert,"on 9th january you wrote this piece about  affiliate relaunching with   
how about a follow up telling how they  daily fantasy sports  track and pay affiliates for referrals before that and how they can't or won't fix this ""problem""?"
mschwimer,against the spread . and sides. mls too. i think the highest we have done so far is +350 range and -400 range. you can check for yourself. all plays are available for all to see. free of charge.
mschwimer,absolutely not. i am being completely clear and up front about how we will handle all scoring. living up to o you are goal of being fully transparent to o you are subscribers and n overtime hiding behind anything.
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  think they ran it by hard rock and i  daily fantasy sports  *think* hard rock would have any issue with it (based on the people i know there) but i can't say for certain.
SportsCheetah,"thanks i laid it earlier this week on the cowboys. 

also on toledo/ball state would take ball if qb is out so just would follow the news on that in the morning if you're actually betting the game."
SportsCheetah,and ignoring the misses is one way to put it when they show a live recap every single day of the best bets record on television. regardless point was i hope bear stays hot. have a nice evening.
SportsCheetah,i'm n overtime granted l assit week's final score a little misleading. byu outgained usf by 125 yards and 10 first downs or something like that. if hall plays though and bachmeier is out 6.5 is too many.
capjack2000,"15.1.3 - general rules

they should add to the list of prohibited wagers those where a winning side can n overtime be wagered upon. this would eliminate the predatory one-sided prop bets we see in some jurisdictions."

it represents lobbying dollars for the vastly underfunded racino industry in fl as they fight a slanted playing field vs. the seminoles.

capjack2000,"i think lsr puts out generally good content regardless of how they make income for the site.

dinkinc,that seems almost impossible yet i am sure it is acurate ... trump has empowered every piece of shit to think  it is  ok to be a piece of shit... gonna take a long time to undo this
dinkinc,it is  hard to think you're a racist when in fact you are  a moron... i am more concerned with those who are racist and intelligent for they  have been given the platform to do something about it
dinkinc,its the first half.  dodgers likely would have moved on if they could have scored a run a free throw er the second inning but no one called out their hitters.  three runs doesnt win too many games
dinkinc,exhibition hockey is a bad example for clv...you get it by  years old you are ability to get lineups quickly and n overtime by handicapping... you can usually piggyback moves on the favorite and bury the closing number
dinkinc,ty...  it is  easy to be legit when i have no income from any of this...i just try to make some money for the horses... the only downside is the embarassment from losing... the good outweighs the bad
robpizzola,im a big fan of both frank reich and kyle shanahan but they have both made an awful in-game decision already today. even the best coaches still arent anywhere close to o point imal with situational decision making.
robpizzola,i was downtown in different spots all day. the police did a great job. they were literally everywhere but didnt interfere in the celebration. two dummies decide to pull out guns and they were taken down almost immediately.

RASPicks,re: an earlier tweet this is a decent baseline to follow if you're looking to keep a public record of  years old you are picks. wish more folks serious about proving themselves would post against this minimal standard.
ProfessorShine,i was wrong also.  i was dead wrong on how nj gaming would handle their sports books too.   right now the consumer looking for fair prices to bet or good information to use should probably purchase some vaseline

i'm n overtime an ol coach but that doesn't sound like the best idea."
suuma810,that is  fair but dalton at le assit gives them a particular floor. we know what he can do (2015) and what he can't do (since). tough to replace him this off-season without a l overtime of uncertainty.
suuma810,had phi/tb total at 48.5. todd monken is the real deal but also expected eagles to move the ball more efficiently against a bad  decimated bucs secondary. fourth quarter  touchdown  pass on 4th down g overtime us there.
ClevTA,done is a stretch kiid. 4th in the nfl in yards 11th in yds/att with 23  touchdown  and 20 int. hes n overtime a top 10 qb anymore but def better than half the starters in the league
ClevTA,nba gms dont think like fans and media with perce point ion against golden st. that wasnt an issue. maybe they get a l overtime more now than 2 years ago and it will prove to be smart

im sticking with my guns that only a tiny sprinkle of skill plays a part."
spanky,"an amate you are bookmaker recently told me he doesnt respect me because im n overtime an originator.

i then asked him if he originated his opening lines or did he copy them off someone.  

conversation ended there."
spanky,to any aspiring pro bettors in nj: there is only one place to play  . why? because one day if and when you get good enough you can rest assured you will n overtime be punished for winning.
PlusEVAnalytics,averages make peoples brains hurt. instead just subtract the cancelled games totals from the salami. so if the salami is 140 and cancelled games have totals 10 and 8.5 salami gets graded vs a revised total of 121.5.
aluckyaday,well i believe most soccer pricing models are similar. probability of number of goals for each team from some sort of modified poisson. combine to give prob for each possible score. add up to get prob of win/loss/draw.
aluckyaday,have you looked at their full history and staking joseph? they are n overtime just betting 50/50 -105 propositions. parlays teasers the l overtime are in there. and they stake to level win rather than just level stakes.
aluckyaday,n overtime having the technology ready i would think is one reason. that is really what i meant by protecting their own territory. they need to be ready to compete on a product level before doing anything else.
aluckyaday,but the recreational parlay bettor is n overtime going to win very o free throw en. n overtime sure taxing their big wins is going to stop them doing it. they have more of a lottery mindset anyway.
aluckyaday,probably because it is easier to manage a single reduction factor than having individual limits per person per market. if they have a thousand markets and a million customers then that would be a billion limits to manage!
aluckyaday,this case should be a pretty easy on to adjudicate though. if their terms and conditions  daily fantasy sports  allow correlated parlays then the bet should n overtime have been taken and it is right to void it..
aluckyaday,"""all bets through the sportsbook go into the exchange strengthening liquidity and conversely as smarkets market-makers sharpen up and broaden out their pricing that in turn strengthens the sportsbook offering"" do the regulators understand the term ""the exchange""?"
aluckyaday,massive growth does n overtime create liquid markets. i'd dispute  years old you are use of the word massive. global gambling growth is n overtime predicted to be massive? us growth maybe but on a global scale no.
aluckyaday,my personal rules for anyone that tries to follow me... do they have protected tweets - blocked. are they selling something i'm n overtime interested in - blocked. do they engage in twitter conversations? if n overtime blocked.
aluckyaday,its going to go stale very quickly if he sticks to the tiesj line. you need to point him towards you riders to watch series so he has a few more future stars to add to his arsenal.
theFirmAISports,im a little disappointed with  you cant feed this guys ego anymore. i feel like you need to subtract points for the fouls that **should** have been called against him.. other than that i love the new metric!
joeytunes2,my word this stretch for the sixers if tough. possible eagles in the superbowl. the same time there in miami. even if n overtime the sixers will be partying. look to fade them 5 months from now lol.
joeytunes2,i look out for the books. i just want my bite. i agree with you. excellent thread. i never would take a bad line. i've called   the greek grande vegas places. telling them to correct there bad line.
joeyisaks,thanks  korea is the best! nicest people / but as they say have you ever noticed theres so many koreans everywhere you go? its because we dont want to live in seoul so im in usa for football
nonrandomalpha,g overtime me crackin' up with the shade thrown at the 'lean but i pass' comment - love dave's authenticity transparency and straight forwardness  it is  these types of qualities that allow lasting relationships with clients to develop
nonrandomalpha,first of all lets define value particularly positive expected value which were all in the game of ca point uring. its part subjective but also objective. + expected value is n overtime just taking a big price (+30000).
nonrandomalpha,its n overtime just about making good/bad calls its about having the judgment with respect to when to make calls. refs should be aware of the context in which theyre operating n overtime making calls in a silo.
nonrandomalpha,kickers crush balls in practice. kickers crush balls in college. coming into the nfl and playing under pressure is a different beast. seeing her bl assit balls in practice is a non-factor. this whole conversation is a meme.
LeeSharpeNFL,week 17 is super fluky so a free throw er week 16 i'm glad i at le assit managed to get in the top 10 percent  to finish out the season a free throw er a rough start.
LeeSharpeNFL,disagree. the fact that teams still have something to play for something in the regular season (the byes) even a free throw er earning playoff sp overtime is highly valuable i  daily fantasy sports  want to lose that.
LeeSharpeNFL,trying to measure individual contribution is a noble endeavor but i  daily fantasy sports  think  expected points added  splits are the right approach. especially because people underestimate how much of the passing game is under the qb's control.
LeeSharpeNFL,"note that by just running my code manually you won't get the ""note"" and special stuff applied retroactively only for future games. to apply those fixes retroactively run the plays-functions.r file then the code in the following tweet:"
LeeSharpeNFL,and cpoe is in percentages which people understand.  expected points added  being in numbers like 0.03 is going to turn a l overtime of non-math folks off as valuable of a statistic as i believe that it is.
LeeSharpeNFL,sorry some work stuff came up and i wasn't able to put the effort in that i had hoped. but i really enjoyed working with you and happily would do so again you're great and did awesome. :)
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  ok on the first run it should proceed p assit it. it just means it was trying to open  years old you are file and couldn't. then it will start a fresh copy of the data.
whale_capper,plus as someone who has been following this as closely as possible to try and learn from this i have a wildly incomplete picture of what's actually going on... ridiculous amounts of rumor and misinformation fuel this space

AndyMSFW,sorry i missed  years old you are question before.  all my women's world cup plays are based on xg st against the spread situational factors the research we did pre-tourney talking to other handicappers and most importantly: price.
AndyMSFW,wish we had touched on this in the podcast.  the rules are different with this 24 team/6 group set up.  16 advance: top 2 from each group as well as the best 4 teams of the 6 third-placers.
AndyMSFW,you think in general you're in a better position to judge  years old you are edge on an outright price when taken during the tournament (like the homa pick) compared to taking a position earlier in the week?
JoeyKnish22,great responses so far. unfortunately all wrong. it was a trick question. correct answer is nobody. and only real question is what size f you are coat will i buy when i collect the winnings at the window.
TheKostos,bayern/over and barca/napoli under all cash. barca +120 loser. shoulda stuck to my thought l assit week and played the draw. oh well. another winning soccer a free throw ernoon. back at it tomorrow for real/city and lyon/juve

DannyParkins,so i lean over on this like many of you. if giannis gets to 3+ mvp's he'll join this group as the only guys in nba history to do it: kareem wilt russell moses bird magic jordan lebron.
DannyParkins,if a gif of the tommy boy scene where the waitress goes do you guys want this or gladiators? and they respond in unison gladiators existed i would use it for how i feel about this cubs game.
DannyParkins,if you include craig kimbrel the cubs added a closer a dude who mashes le free throw ies a speedster and a couple bullpen arms. honestly given the cash constraints they clearly had  that is  n overtime bad.
DannyParkins,"that is  hilarious i literally watched that episode yesterday. landsmen is one of the funniest characters in the whole show. i love the look bunk gives when he shows off his clothes and lestor goes ""i like that."""
DannyParkins,im solo  today. what ryan pace is trying to pull off and why its ok if he misses.  at 3  at 4:25 and  at 5. plus why we should let that fan get what he wants against russ.
DannyParkins,. hit probably the single best sh overtime ive ever seen live today. that was an absolute bl assit of a round. talk to ya soon  theo scheduled for 1:30 and albert almora will join later as well.
DannyParkins,this is the infuriating part of replay even though it benefits the bulls. trae young clearly stepped out of bounds and because the hawks asked for a replay they get it and it slows the game down unnecessarily.
DannyParkins,good luck to  doing the play by play for the cubs today on  theres n overtime many people who can say theyve had that opportunity and i know no bigger baseball fan who appreciates that more than spiegs.

Gingfacekillah,for me personally if i get one solid idea w/r/t feature engineering or data formatting for the nba in r it would probably be worth it. it definitely looks like the writing might be strained through i agree.
Gingfacekillah,ill be explaining one or two simulation models for sure. i may throw some vba content in as well wasnt planning on it but it can be very useful. ill see if i cant squeeze it in there.
Gingfacekillah,very simple. really just showing clues that can guide  years old you are investigation of spots. they become even more apparent with more sophisticated statistical analysis. it will be interesting to see how booker's lines are set tonight/tomorrow.
logan_matthews9,one position i did add was conners -105 vs champ r2. as i said before do n overtime get the love for champ. n overtime crazy about conners but certainly higher than champ. shout out  for this one

b365 3.6:1"
adamchernoff,yes. refund was sent and subscri point ion cancelled. keep the ticket posting attention seeking and false grading for twitter. no room in the channel for immaturity. do n overtime try resubscribe it will be refunded. good luck.
adamchernoff,i could also install more margin on den (very common with larger underdogs) if risk dictated such. all of this is straightforward bookmaking until applied to the nfl. the reason being is that the point spread comes first.

12Xpert,i acce point  that there have been publicised cases of bookmakers encouraging those who have sought self exclusion to gamble more. but does that imply the practice is widespread and industry-wide? maybe. but  let us  see the evidence.
12Xpert,i suppose you need to know about how to translate odds into probability and other things like margin and favourite-longsh overtime bias so  it is  easy for the uninitiated simply to listen to o point a et al.
12Xpert,"because she's a person like me and you. that is the point. read the piece again. ""i hate that people are judged on who they are.""

you  daily fantasy sports  have to like what she says respect that."
12Xpert,"a score for a team in a match is defined by:
win = 1-1/odds
n overtime win = -1/odds
as set out in my contrarian betting system. remember colder teams could be the ones to bet on next."
12Xpert,if people vote for use then i'm down with that. the problem is they hardly ever get asked about these things so that kinda reduces representative democracy to autocracy. that was one of the reasons for brexit too.
12Xpert,it might be but sadly i  daily fantasy sports  have penalties data. far fewer reds so how reliable would it be. anecdotally i  daily fantasy sports  feel i see a bias when i'm collecting the red card data.
12Xpert,which rather proves that var at le assit in the way it has been implemented in the uk has n overtime solved the problem it was designed to solve it has merely changed the nature of talking points.
12Xpert,exactly. the question for debate here is whether biases are sufficiently large to be able to exploit them for a consistent long term profit (beyond luck) once the costs of playing in the market have been accounted for.
12Xpert,6 months since  moved their affiliate programme to  still in breach of tcs having failed to retag previous referrals allowing their partners to earn revenue from those. neither affiliate managers nor  interested. brand n overtime fit for purpose.
12Xpert,no the point about things regressing to the mean is that it happens because there is nothing causal only luck. however i have written about a possible way to may be exploit others who are fooled by this.
mschwimer,i 100 percent  agree with the chart for all touts before we entered the space. before us no one has offered a money back plus guarentee. no one before us has been in full financial alignment with subscribers.
mschwimer,precisely! if we talk about how good we are we get slammed. then we say if you dont believe it short us. then we get slammed for n overtime talking about how good we are. gamblingtwitter is beautiful.
mschwimer,official announcement.  will grade all its picks using fanduel sportsbooks rules. they simply make the most sense. even  can admit that if you announce how you are grading picks it can never be seen as typical tout grading
mschwimer,we are now 19-4-1 against the spread  since we started doing free podc assit picks.  while this is obviously unsustainable it feels good to be hot! plays available to the public on  are now 227-171-11.  58.7 percent !!!
RufusPeabody,point is that if joe burrow could go from being a non-prospect to a (potential) #1 overall pick in 3 months what does that say about qb evaluation and how strongly nfl teams hold onto those evaluations

RufusPeabody,i understand that. you have publicly endorsed them though and said they are different so i thought i should bring it to  years old you are attention. they talked a big game but have n overtime delivered.
RufusPeabody,that is  the things with the bet  percent /money  percent  mumbojumbo. there's no actionable info to glean from it without context. which book(s) are used? are they market making books or retail books? and at what price?
RufusPeabody,but can you predict who the 20 percent  of clients are going to be going forward? no. can you predict who  years old you are winning clients are going to be going forward? books believe they can.
jeffma,converting that first down which is probably better than 50 percent  effectively ends the game. and without converting  years old you are are still two scores up.  do you have a good win prob analysis of this?
SportsCheetah,theres no real precise way to line that. if you guys can come to an agreement on a price and are wanting to bet with one another roll with that. mahomes deserves to be a big favorite.

SportsCheetah,first bad week of college foots this season. no matter how many times it has happened before its still difficult to get a bad taste out of  years old you are mouth. good weekend reminder (particularly #3):
SportsCheetah,tough one but i dont envision baltimore throwing too o free throw en and there will likely be fewer plays run in their game. winston against the 30th ranked defense has upside. id probably go with him.
SportsCheetah,i do round robins on dogs every week early in the season until conference play starts up (i posted them you can check them out hit a few pretty nicely). just felt like firing on one tonight.
SportsCheetah,bet them? yeah. we've been going over a l overtime of them on daily wager but i imagine we will have an nba futures article as well that i contribute to with some of my favorite plays.

ClevTA,i didnt do a full write up and have a strong opinion about the browns game all i said is i thought the spread was getting too big. so to answer  years old you are tweet no

LeeSharpeNFL,this is why i  daily fantasy sports  criticize pace for picking trubisky but do criticize him for being so confident he wanted trubisky that he gave up two 3rd round picks to ensure he g overtime him.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah i  daily fantasy sports  see how people take this stuff that seriously.

i suspect aaron rodgers is fantastic human. i wish him no injuries a happy life and i hope his team gets many many losses."
LeeSharpeNFL,no no you gotta suspend the whole practice and make everyone on the team watch as the kickers trying out have to kick repeatedly from the sp overtime you're upset about missing in the l assit game.

logan_matthews9,its on credit so the time frame is irrelevant. and you cant factor for injuries in a game... or lucky bounces bad calls etc. all that will mostly level off over the course of a season though

CizzlingSports,they release football picks before sat and saturdays are by far and away their highest volume day so  it is  entirely possible a sub could have put $20k into play before the weekend even starts lol
CizzlingSports,"lol he did it again fam

CizzlingSports,"the entirely predictable and wholly uncommon phenomenon here is that self-monitored and self-scored tout picks always seem to win.

on the other hand publicly-monitored and publicly-scored tout picks never seem to win.

CizzlingSports,"specially skilled to be able to discern a man's true quality a free throw er a 30  minutes telephone conversation i guess. 

you have an ulterior motive here. i just wish you'd be upfront about it."
CizzlingSports,some1 with a nose for profit pls explain what it is abt darrel that drives ppl to buy sooper seekrit betting info unless the object here isnt actually selling garbage but something else entirely oh wait
CizzlingSports,the affiliate fee mission statement which to my knowledge the current ceo has n overtime rescinded or repudiated should change  years old you are mind about millman's character. all of this is likely above schwartz's head.

spanky,heres penn interactive's jon kaplowitz admitting  ceo joe asher kicks out sharps from his casinos.  during my question joe did deny he uses a baseball bat.  kudos to joe asher for n overtime resorting to violence
spanky,i doubt any of the shops down there would reveal their location let alone process an in-person withdrawal.  it took me the better part of the l assit 20 years to be welcomed as an insider.
spanky,the hole in  years old you are argument is playing sports and advertising a product are independent events. betting a game and selling a pick on that same game results in a major conflict of interest
spanky,joe. i respectfully disagree. the beauty of mathematics is its decisiveness and finality. 2+2=4 is always true. going for 2 in that scenario increases  years old you are chance of winning the game is always true.
spanky,good luck to all the sports bettors and bookmakers out there this football season.  may most of  years old you are decisions be blowouts; and on those close games - may the hook be with you!
PlusEVAnalytics,if you could exit  years old you are trades at the closing line without hedging and paying a second dose of vig then you could trade sports without any more variance than youd get trading stocks.
PlusEVAnalytics,neither of those is much better nate. were dealing with probability estimates here. would a bookie make it a pick em? if n overtime its n overtime a tie - actual virtual statistical metaphysical or otherwise.
PlusEVAnalytics,its a simple logical fallacy. bad bettors lose so fading bad bettors should win. bad bettors dont win 50 percent  of the time they win 0 percent  of the time because theyre bad at this. #fooledbyrandomness
PlusEVAnalytics,if you want to win by increasing turnout you have to nominate bernie and if you want to win by flipping trump voters you have to hold  years old you are nose and nominate bloomberg right?
PlusEVAnalytics,lots of game theory behind a 2 point  conv chart - you can build the strategy that performs best against itself (nash equilibrium) but th against the spread n overtime always real world o point imal...
aluckyaday,the other issue with scaling it is the variance. the maximum drawdown for my selections over the 3 years i have been doing it was 446.6 units. so it would require a sizeable bank to scale.
aluckyaday,interesting that they have listed betting activities as an acce point able source of wealth though. i wonder if they would still open an account for you if you sent them a betfair premium charge notice
aluckyaday,what chance dqs run a long lead out until the uphill bit then stop allowing gilbert or stybar to sho overtime off the front? will be interesting to see how they line up from 3km out.
aluckyaday,depends how you stake it  i try to stake so i win the same no matter how many riders i select or their prices. so really i only have one bet my selections against the field.
aluckyaday,the european model is a little different though. the books want to keep the recreational dollar for themselves rather than share it with sharper punters. ironically this is a good thing for the true recreational punter.
aluckyaday,hate to tell you guys that its only going to get worse. betfair sportsbook in the uk same company as fd will n overtime take a penny yes n overtime even $0.01 from me on anything.
theFirmAISports,i wish he would have rocked the baby to sleep! what a shot! russ was talkin a l overtime of smack for only winning 1 game in this series... dame showed out! #nbaontnt #nbaplayoffs #okcvspor #damedolla
joeyisaks,when you are 67 and $ isnt an issue 12  million is just a number sanity is more valuable and it was taking years off his life ... he can get whatver ncaa opening he wants
joeyisaks,would be great if instead of game they had some sort of memorial service for fans to come to and a tribute to him? i know fans were lookin forward to going just for that aspect
joeyisaks,its tough bc we think hed want the games to be played but he was also only 41 and has plenty of friends former teammates still in league and have to respect their grieving process too
joeyisaks,darren- you are using as  years old you are example a bookie who doesnt take more than 300$ a game and doesnt use a pph site... this is literally worthless as its so outside the normal
EdMillerPoker,full disclosure: my company intends to solve this problem. agree that there's a data problem in ncaa but there's an analytics problem for all us sports and both failings are why you see no ncaa markets.
EdMillerPoker,i have extensive experience with the nfl realtime data feed and in my opinion sportsbooks are n overtime being cheap if they  daily fantasy sports  buy it. it isn't yet good enough to meet their needs.
EdMillerPoker,im n overtime up on the economics of starbucks but i would think it would be easy for them to preserve that dynamic (feeling like youre gaming the program) without it actually costing starbucks much extra.
EdMillerPoker,the dynamic in sports is much thinner. the only underlying asset is entertainment. and apart from that consumer enjoying the entertainment there are few diverse interests on the operational side exce point  to gamble (and win)
EdMillerPoker,"there are v few ppl who consistently say smart things about gambling on twitter and of those the majority are ""anonymous"". mostly they aren't really anonymous tho they've been posting under the same handle for years"

 it is  ok to love them anyway though."
LeeSharpeNFL,via /u/jaguargator9 on reddit the 49ers/saints game (48-46) is the first regular season game where both teams indivually scored more points than vegas' total line for both teams combined (45) since a bears/vikings game in 2008.

JoeyKnish22,lol the issue is you can pick all the way up to kickoff for each game. so if youre towards the bottom as it gets close to the end you could start nba tanking on purpose.
JoeyKnish22,you and  years old you are boy gil already on my shit list for all this chase young propaganda! and now i g overtime rufus and ma shilling the other osu player. and ive had it.
JoeyKnish22,final later today. plenty of hedge possibilities if youre into that. dont hate a cheap peru +1.5 as is. think this will be much more competitive than the group stage game. scene should be absolutely bananas.
TheKostos,titans with quite possible the dumbest opening possession ever. two dion lewis runs up the middle for nothing and then tanny brought down on 3rd. lol. maybe throw it since you  daily fantasy sports  have henry?
TheKostos,remember: the giants  owned by do-nothing trust-find baby clown john mara  watch the clapper shit his pants in person twice a year and on tv like the rest of us and apparently want to hire him!!!!!!!!

LockyLockerson,tonight's results will neither confirm nor deny that the process is sound but  it is  the same process as l assit year (which was very profitable) at  it is  core.  no one go bridge-jumping tonight please.
LockyLockerson,most encouraging part is i think because of ratings/injury news i am able to almost always predict market movement and in a l overtime of cases that means the spreads are closing right around my #.
LockyLockerson,daily fantasy sports  have one clue how the giants cover tonight if the game is 60 minutes long played as scheduled.  but  that is  why i'm sitting here doing work on college football i guess instead.
LockyLockerson,n overtime a great fit price wise in a bunch of my favorite bets but could go with michigan / app state / sdsu / buffalo with buffalo doing a l overtime of the work multiplier-wise.
LockyLockerson,guys if my picks dont win you money just wanna let you know my backers have ok-ed a policy where i get to pay you nothing and continue on with my day.  big time backers too.
LockyLockerson,"i try n overtime to do that too much the ""well this team always blows it"" type of mentality.  remember ""clemson-ing"" was a thing a few years ago and now  it is  hilarious to remember that."
LockyLockerson,haha i dunno about that but thanks.  i  daily fantasy sports  usually finalize my mlb win totals until right before the season but when we get there i'll try to make everything as public as possible.
EliHershkovich,baylor hung on against butler but big issue for the bears is tristan clark (knee). didn't play tonight and doesn't look healthy a free throw er offseason surgery. they're limited offensively without a legit low-post big.

DannyParkins,come on. every reporter had it including a bunch of local chicago reporters. this clearly came from the sox. which is fine just a different pr strategy than i would've taken. n overtime a huge deal.
DannyParkins,im n overtime giving up on him either. but that comparison doesnt hold up because his career is over by mid 30s historically. hes almost 50 percent  through his first contract. different timeline for evaluating success/failure.
DannyParkins,getting going next 4 hours  10 week 5 thoughts at 10 et starts us off. nfc e assit ho you are at 11 et with  and  11:40. 855-212-4227 to join the convo. listen live  or here:
DannyParkins,my point is this nucleus makes up a 95 win average team over the l assit 4 years. they might struggle to win 85 this year. they are a wildly frustrating group of underachievers right now.
DannyParkins,my man  filling-in 5-9pm ct on  and then i take over from 9pm-1am. pretty damn cool. if you're n overtime from kc and can pull up the stream or get to sirius 206 check him out.
DannyParkins,now for the part of opening day where i take a seat in pat hughes chair getting ready to host a radio show using pat hughes mic from pat hughes booth. very lucky and excited for

the market reacts by assuming these bettors are geniuses...but is it skill or random chance?"
logan_matthews9,it was legitimate advice! unless  years old you are bankroll is well over $1m even with an extreme edge that was unlikely because of the sports you bet too much (assuming you arent hedging other places)
PikachuBets,"then again anyone who couldn't tell it was cris just by the formatting of the bet slip shouldn't even be allowed to have a conversation about ""where did this line come from"" with us anyway lol"
PikachuBets,sorry but i'm n overtime that kind of pokmon and i'm sure  years old you are anus has had enough rimming for the week already. should give it a rest before you get those nasty hemorrhoids
PikachuBets,both. also stop saying hes 60 percent  lol. his sample sizes are tiny tiny tiny. nowhere close to being a proven winner much less one who should be charging for any plays in a new market

adamchernoff,good find. i have n overtime been paying too much attention to it this season. i feel like the market has caught up in many regards. curious to see how it plays out this week though.
Ccon8181,i own losing weeks... it happens all about transparency. it sucks but its part of the business. but its time for a nice solid run. some nice sides set up for the weekend. ready to feast
Ccon8181,its n overtime so much about the money more so how the sports betting gold rush has lead to pros representing the industry on tv/radio who dont have the slightest idea about doing this full time.

ToddFuhrman,"so if utah wins next week and the bigxii champion fails to advance as well then what happens?  

would have an easier time handling the 4 team playoff if criteria for inclusion was much more transparent"
ToddFuhrman,ha nobody wins every day every week or every month despite what twitter will tell you.   it is  when you start to have losing years that it becomes time to go back to the drawing board
ToddFuhrman,it is  a refreshing derby knowing every year i'd make light of the hypocrisy that we celebrate betting on horses but frowned on sports betting; amazing how the national landscape has changed inside of a year
ToddFuhrman,"thanks to all those that came out to watch o you are first ever live episode of  today at

ToddFuhrman,all that means is that there can't be a push.  if you go over 8.5 you'd need 9 or more to win whereas if you bet under you'd need 8 or fewer to cash a ticket

12Xpert,i have a far more effective tool for setting limits: my woc method. follow it without efforts to disguise  years old you are activity and you will have all  years old you are bookmaker accounts closed.
12Xpert,it worked for me although n overtime as reliable as football from memory. perhaps this was because this was based on atp/wta data only no challengers or futures as was the case for miguel's data set
12Xpert,there are those particularly in the traditional religious sectors who would regard that as immoral. they would see it as a form of cheating on the grounds that gambling is meant to be about luck only.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  doubt that. as with tipsters though most are blind to their own absence of skill and when a forec assit comes good they erroneously believe they had something to do with it.
12Xpert,indeed there are gamblers to gamble in excess and losers who lose more than they can afford. but they are n overtime stupid in the same way that anyone with any other mental illness isn't stupid.
12Xpert,"have a read of robert axelrod's ""the evolution of cooperation"" stephen possibly the best non-fiction book i've ever read. reveals through game theory how cooperation between individuals animals in social groups is an inevitable evolutionary outcome."
12Xpert,that is  correct. the service was  which operated as a verification service from 2005 to 2014 (and 4 years via football-data before that). about 300 services were verified and about 200000 tips. almost entirely coin tossing.
12Xpert,what d'ya mean n overtime planned it. everything has a plan. there's design in everything. everything happens for a reason. no such think as chance. just insufficient data. i expect to get rich quick with this.
mschwimer,then the lines could move right a free throw er we release which would again be a disadvantage to subscribers as they would have less time to get the picks in at the lines we release.

RufusPeabody,n overtime a l overtime of sims where that occurs but when those 4 scenarios are met  it is  lsu ohio st clemson at 100 percent  georgia 90 percent  alabama 3 percent  florida 2 percent
RufusPeabody,in the situation i outlined (team down 14 scores a  touchdown  late in the 4th quarter) going for two is *still* the o point imal choice if you assume a rate of 40 percent .
RufusPeabody,"i just used market-making book (pinny/cris) so no one would say ""what if it was bovada"" or some asinine comment. the question was really ""do you measure closing line value vs. close or no-vig close"""
RufusPeabody,and if model b doesn't weight the inputs as well as model a model b could get a negative weight relative to model a. i.e. model a = 110 percent  model b = -10 percent
RufusPeabody,the committee is supposed to be judging teams based on their resume and how good they are based on what they've done on the field. only weight on priors is to gauge quality of opposition.
RufusPeabody,blocking critics on twitter is n overtime 'right' or 'wrong' per se. people can use twitter as they see fit. but the notion that people are only blocked on twitter for bad behavior is false.
jeffma,speaking at  at 5:15 on the main stage. talking about how  is bringing moneyball to the hotel industry and how i hope to help drive data driven decisions! come say hi if you are here
SportsCheetah,the right side is the one that outplayed the other and in a sample of infinity will turn a profit. being able to decipher that  win or lose  will help make future projections/predictions more efficient.
SportsCheetah,the total for this game was 165-166.5 today and hbu was inbounding length of the floor and it landed 167 (and counted)  the camera wasnt even on the play n overtime sure how it happened.
SportsCheetah,good thing the guy li free throw ed his leg in the end zone so his team could lose on the long pat instead of going to  overtime (or going for 2 and the win)!
SportsCheetah,yeah we bet the wnba heavily before the all-star break. market tightens up quite a bit a free throw er that so havent had many significant edges outside of that game 1 total in aces/mystics.
capjack2000,too big for twitter.  it is  the kind of story that'll need to be told on a massive scale down the line when they've swallowed up the majority of the market share in emerging states.
capjack2000,you need to have the entire maximum loss available in  years old you are account to place the bet. if it was 50x then he would need to have $50k to bet $1k/ point .
capjack2000,"incase you missed it  on friday this podc assit was worth a listen simply because i actually said nice things about 

i talked strategy about the upcoming $1 million super pool and the 2nd dksbnc."
capjack2000,daily fantasy sports  forget that 50 percent  of population of the us was told to stop watching the nfl because some players knelt during the national anthem. so we've already eliminated 160 million potential bettors.
capjack2000,"its 10:10pm. the second college football game of the season kicks off in 20 minutes and  sportsbook has closed for the night. 

a license to print money but you dont want to waste the electricity?!?"
capjack2000,correct. penn gets a ~4.7 percent  stake in thescore in exchange for thescore getting various skin rights for penn properties. there's also a revenue share for profits from those sports betting operations run by thescore.
capjack2000,"i have no horse in that race...however i will commend  for n overtime only offering a two-sided prop but also a very reasonable 3.75 percent  vig. 

limits are probably $50 but still a decent effort."
capjack2000,as much as i would like someone to deal a dime line on mlb it could be worse. when dk and fd hit the market l assit summer they struggled to even deal 20 cents.
dinkinc,i learn from what you bet and the reasons you made  years old you are bets...you encourage people to bet early and we like to see if we bet the same games as you did
dinkinc,it was just a general question taken from some of his coaching change podcasts. i am sure some of them are in the line but i am just looking for a ballpark figure i guess
dinkinc,i think one of  years old you are problems is the comparison with every other thing you have done for this company at the highest of levels. its a gi free throw   its a curse..
dinkinc,yesterday i bet 14 races while at saratoga and then saratoga  harness ... went a cool 0-14 ...  back at it again today and tomorrow  and the next day.... still my favorite place to be
dinkinc,more about the guests who  daily fantasy sports  gamble for a living and talk about trends and motivation.... i wanted to get on to plug   and talk gambling theory...did give out a winner as well
robpizzola,yep  it is  been a trend for a few years now. none of the major sites mark it as a neutral site game like they do with other sports so i can understand the confusion.
robpizzola,absolutely epic rant by boone but props to the ump for letting him vent. id love to see more of that instead of these short fuse umps just tossing managers le free throw  and right.
robpizzola,if  it is  a guarantee that they are going to one or the other then they would win $100. each of those wagers would be graded as either a $1100 win or a $1000 loss.
ProfessorShine,shes been a fraud for a long time and her gender means little.  she also has a history of fat shaming other women and making fun of dead people.  you dont like it block me.
ProfessorShine,her career to this point was about selling picks n overtime to get better at betting. she currently works for gri free throw ers at wagertalk promoting their salesmen who are as bad as vd.
suuma810,im having a hard time with a team n overtime even  trying when you have watson and hopkins on  years old you are team. sure its a low probability situation but n overtime even trying?
suuma810,ben wrote about the evolving community that is analytics twitter and the work that has been done by 'outsiders' on #nfl data.  it is  a fantastic piece  a must-read for every nfl (or sports) fan.
suuma810,and there isn't a better lt on their roster right now.  it is  n overtime about the player  it is  about the contract. they can still find a new starter and get rid of him.
suuma810,something is still wrong with the 2018 premium database. the estimated wins column in the total dvoa dataset is wrong. e.g. 0.9 estimated wins for the rams. they are also 31st in with touchdown  dvoa.
ClevTA,his good friend baker mayfield is extremely close friends with mason rudolph and doesnt want to defame him publicly? he doesnt have have to be public with this to win this case in appeals right?
ClevTA,ive said for years i dont care if a writer or analyst gambles or n overtime but just paying attention to why vegas lines are a certain why helps u dissect games. just laziness otherwise
ClevTA,thought we all talked about this like 2  years ago? the godfather  told me about the pants then i latched on and we are now only put on earth to spread the lulu pants gospel
ClevTA,i think he was talking specifically about tendencies in the red zone. maybe th against the spread a big reason why theyve struggled all year? they dont run pick plays or rubs ever. very genetic
CizzlingSports,dont have  tweet handy but in between those two abortions zuma told  that he didnt understand the conce point  of value and the second ss was # worst of all time 's reply to that
CizzlingSports,"now seems like a good tyme to remind every1 that  and  consistently refused to answer any questions abt what size bankroll is needed to survive 1000 bets over 17 weeks at $300/bet

PlusEVAnalytics,average * team1 deviation from average * team2 deviation from average. its the simplest way to force a team that scores 3.5 goals on average to be projected for 3.5 goals against an average team.
PlusEVAnalytics,i actually had a phone call with schwimer a few weeks ago (one of several it seems). he seemed totally genuine but admitted his quant team has zero experience with betting markets. its showing here.
PlusEVAnalytics,"michael to his lawyer: youll go on twitter and answer legal questions from random degenerates wont you? btw i just promised you would

aluckyaday,would be interesting to see the numbers. there is an interesting interview with paris smith saying she can only dream about having bet365's numbers. maybe she was referring to denise co against the spread salary!
aluckyaday,yes but the customer is watching a stream that is delayed. you will still have the problem of bets being rejected because they thought they were placing a bet during a break and they weren't.
aluckyaday,so you are basically saying automated bet placement is impossible in nj? i find that very difficult to believe. i would n overtime be trying to beat geolocation as the computer would be in nj
aluckyaday,guess it depends how you define information. long term winners have information telling them the bookmaker line is wrong. they could get that information in various ways one of which is being a better compiler
aluckyaday,you do seem to be taring all touts with the same brush  . i get the impression  years old you are disdain for a few prominent ones may be clouding  years old you are judgement.
aluckyaday,still seems to be a lack of consistency. some want you to chop off a finger and send it in to prove who you are others just a click of a button and its done!
aluckyaday,a good theory is something that can't be disproven. ask anne elk or einstein even!  that is my theory it is mine and belongs to me and i own it and what it is too.

joeytunes2,my best injury guys so far are     ....i'll be giving them a 25 free bet. but keep the injury/suspensions coming. ty!~guys lmk the game or if you want me to bet one of my plays.
joeytunes2,offshore is going nowhere. wynn opens early also. but as soon as cris opens they move there way. openers aren't really relevant at 2k a pop. but definitely  agree with rufus that they free ride..
EdMillerPoker,both of which i think are good policies like th against the spread how books *should* run for the most part but i can see a million problems if you write that into the regs.
EdMillerPoker,why? well its because football hasnt been a very relevant sport in europe until now but also because theres a certain lack of commitment to the quality side of things th against the spread pervasive.
EdMillerPoker,its crazy to me that we have an industry that intentionally rejects up to half its own the business. dont know if any other industry anywhere that behaves this way and its brutal customer experience.
EdMillerPoker,n overtime sure what opposite means there and im no business expert but the way this industry approaches marketing has always felt insane to me and completely out of step with basically every other industry.
EdMillerPoker,"i've noticed that when people start a tech business their twitter feed morphs into a nauseating mix of ra-ra play-by-play news of their startup and silicon valley bro affirmations.

sooo..  that is  now this feed."
EdMillerPoker,"you've put a finger on the answer to the ""why n overtime bet it?"" question.  for what  it is  worth  i think that will change and i hope o you are product is the catalyst."
EdMillerPoker,"ppl out here quote retweeting shitpost memes with like a little bit of text calling it out

you get that no one reads  years old you are little sentence they just see the meme right?"
EdMillerPoker,"i'll be returning the favor when his book ""how to win so much money on a gameshow that the producers negotiate a buyout that pays you out longer than bobby bonilla's mets contract"" comes out"
EdMillerPoker,i see. i suppose it isnt commercially reasonable to force you to buy data that has too high an error rate to use as intended sounds like a fun five year court battle for someone.....
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i can probably count on one hand the number of people qualified to estimate within an order of magnitude the value of a piece of in game sports gambling ip
EdMillerPoker,why n overtime say theres some customers we simply cant beat and for those we have to limit the damage. we are working every day to better serve all o you are customers including these.
EdMillerPoker,edge times volume. edge is v high and so is volume. i have to hand it to the sl overtime designers these days the games are great at getting you to keep pressing the button.
EdMillerPoker,sports betting has way more in common with games than with financial markets imo. a l overtime of money has been lit on fire by people who took the sports markets=financial markets analogy too seriously.
EdMillerPoker,hey neil you from nola? if so me too. good luck with  years old you are nba totals. you picked a tough market to beat but if you can crack it youll really have something.
EdMillerPoker,why do companies put so much self-aggrandizing bullshit in their job postings and why do they list requirements basically no one actually meets? honest question is there a real reason for doing it this way??
EdMillerPoker,and if youre like the 7th best in a market at scooping those customers during the gold rush and you dont have a strong plan b you dont really in the end have a business

nonrandomalpha,would you also agree that all kick returns should be auto touchbacks? a return for  touchdown  is low and you expose yourself to injury turnover n overtime getting to the 25 and penalty. asymmetric risk.
nonrandomalpha,some game tape on steelers rookie qb devlin hodges vs. florida state in 2018. dude drops some nice long balls but also has a bit of a slow pass that is vulnerable to ints.  via
nonrandomalpha,winning a playoff game is the bare minimum threshold for determining the season a failure/success.  can't waste mack's prime years floundering with mediocrity. the schedule isn't going to do us any favors this year tho.
nonrandomalpha,"brett k. you're a smart dude but this is egregious. having jimmy g. so low is going to look like handicapping malpractice by season's end. when jimmy actually plays he's an easy top 5.

LeeSharpeNFL,"if the 49ers and seahawks both win today the seahawks playoff seed will move over the course of the day as follows:

#2 (current)
#5 (a free throw er early games)

LeeSharpeNFL,yeah me either. it makes total sense to me why  it is  being done i just feel like some signal is being lost. but as you say i  daily fantasy sports  see a better solution.
LeeSharpeNFL,"oh. the nfl was writing out more of josh allen's name (e.g. ""jos.allen"" instead of ""j.allen"") for those games so my code didn't find him. can fix but away from home so n overtime immediately."
whale_capper,you guys seemed to enjoy this for the nba so here is the nfl snapshot... time-decay wt avg over l4 games calc'd the misfit between market expected performance and actual performance in terms of z-score...

whale_capper,seeing cam move from 40 to 30 just now with no comp puts me at 187 percent  when i sum b/e probs... is there a better way to calc? entirely possible i'm doing it wrong
whale_capper,sure but rafa this year is n overtime as strong as years p assit when theyve gone h2h here... make the match 3-1 nadal but should be more competitive than weve seen in previous finals
whale_capper,some sharp guys i know have made a strong case that the raps could look way more efficient on offense than we've seen from them in the playoffs to this point based on the matchup
whale_capper,he played great d on durant in a couple possessions down the stretch (harden is a sick post defender) but it didnt matter... at a minimum theyre going to have to double him and pray
AndyMSFW,currently working on trying to bet baseball but like everything i do i'm three weeks behind and still n overtime completely sure what i'm doing.  hope to be playing some f5 runlines by late april.
JoeyKnish22,oh my apologies sorry a free throw er  years old you are l assit month of nfl i was under the assum point ion you didnt have any money le free throw . next time.
JoeyKnish22,th against the spread very unfortunate. considering you only had like 12 full days to decide on a selection i feel terrible  years old you are l assit second attem point ed switch didnt process.
JoeyKnish22,im n overtime sure whatever happened to customer service in this industry but lets just say im gonna need a buffet pass and stack of drink tickets to make up for being treated like this!
JoeyKnish22,yeah n overtime sure if he returns but with perry olsen he can operate the offense (n overtime as electric) and with the snap disparity hoping memphis is worn down navy can lean on em.

LockyLockerson,going to wait until mid-a free throw ernoon ish today i think to the nba update.  just way too many unsettled injuries and stuff to give a reasonable opinion on almost any game right now.
LockyLockerson,took about 6  minutes for the director to agree he went to the white house first. which means we should be able to get a complete narrative on the record by about march of 2035.
LockyLockerson,many. have been discussing games on and off all week.  will do more tonight and a deep dive friday night on the show picks up friday night.  they've been especially mediocre so far this year.
LockyLockerson,also if youre wondering what days you already know we are doing the 4 ho you are friday night marathon talking every  college football  game on the board.  th against the spread a given. #stinktown
LockyLockerson,this was pretty epic.  we just finished recording and i have very little voice le free throw .  there is a l overtime of info.  hopefully everyone enjoys it or gets something out of it.
LockyLockerson,i guess the compelling thing is that in a rehearsal you'd think they'd go with the most likely order and instead they announced that order. still probably nothing but kinda funny if  it is  true.

DannyParkins,no it wouldnt. mahomes didnt play year 1 so they still wouldve signed glennon and watson wouldnt have done much as a rookie in a dowell loggains system throwing to markus wheaton and cam meredith.
DannyParkins,this is a great piece by  that takes something all serious cubs observers know: the team collectively struggles against high heat and low breaking stuff and illustrates who and why in an easily consumable way.
DannyParkins,since ive been on in a free throw ernoons its basically impossible for me to make it to  but a day game in colorado makes it possible. today at 6:00 im co minutes in hot.
DannyParkins,right... but you have better players than the teams that lost more games. you want worse players? have gotten the markkanen pick wrong? gotten less for jimmy butler? everyone bad wants to lose a bunch.

Gingfacekillah,"im no expert on teasers but i wouldnt recommend placing them among  years old you are primary strategies. 

if youve worked through the math on nfl teasers and found an edge it might be different."
Gingfacekillah,my base model showed a tight game albeit with a slightly higher total score. with an extra tov factor considered dal was forec assit to just barely lose this one by a handful of points.

mschwimer,size bankroll is completely determined by how we do early on and depends on how much people want to bet. we have a units calculator for this. size of bankroll is determined by the subscriber.

mschwimer,they certainly do exist. you are talking to martin now. also rufus and many more. again i have no idea if they are playing anything as i have no access to their personal betting accounts.
mschwimer,if you actually believe that then put  years old you are money where  years old you are mouth is. if  years old you are right you get 10k. if n overtime you only lose 3k
mschwimer,making my  debut tonight!  if you enjoy sports analytics and content that you will n overtime hear anywhere else tune into daily wager.  show airs at 6pmet.  second half ho you are all ncaa hoops!
RufusPeabody,the argument that if i had a big bankroll i could make a l overtime of money sports betting is asinine. being a good sports bettor is how you get to a big bankroll.
RufusPeabody,"a few model-based nfl takes that go against popular perce point ion:

RufusPeabody,the no-vig line for futures isn't particularly useful since they are taking more vig on certain teams than others. and in general the big longshots aren't priced anywhere near high enough at most books.

 in nj offers -105 on sides  totals of select  college football  games."
capjack2000,steve wynn twice had to pull out of nj because the njccc investigation was getting too hot. now many years and bad deeds later i'm quite confident he could get a license in nj.
capjack2000,interesting. seems inefficient. either let ti manage both or let wh manage both. maybe he feels having two different sets of lines will protect him from the crippling variance that $300 bettors can inflict.
capjack2000,"other states are being added but the attention to nj seems the most comprehensive so far. 

i've been impressed and i hope it continues to evolve.

solid thumbs up for this effort so far."
capjack2000,"i see value in it. you get to see who is checking out  years old you are content and there is a much higher signal-to-noise ratio than twitter.

capjack2000,very good article brad. i think theyve found an affordable and viable entry point into the us market. they wont be reliant on the mythical exchange liquidity to succeed until they want to be.
capjack2000,while the decision to keep it private was  to make i will say that  and i both agree that we're more likely to share quality information given this setup. it'll be a fun evening.
capjack2000,the price movements and pool sizes of both nj horse racing exchange and in-race betting made it obvious you were betting against european syndicates. that alone made it very unattractive to any potential bettor.
capjack2000,if you guys disliked how they show vd in episode 1 youre going to be apoplectic a free throw er episode 2. maybe it changes in episode 3-4 though. every storyline has an arc.
capjack2000,first reaction to daily wager: frenetic pace. lots of information on the screen to also be talking at such a high pace. only a few minutes in. maybe ill get more used to this.

robpizzola,you know fitz is going to be swinging his dick this week too. banged up secondary and you get the sense that these games against gase are like the super bowl for the fins.
robpizzola,whenever you can burn a timeout on third down from the one-yard-line to call a fade and then kick a field goal to go from down 20 to down 17 you gotta do it.
robpizzola,.274 xwoba this season. his era may be up and i'm slightly concerned by the amount of hard hit balls but he's striking out one third of opposing batters and n overtime walking guys.
robpizzola,i actually unfollowed sometime towards the end of march. nothing personal but have been barely using twitter these days because my timeline is overwhelming. you weren't the first unfollow and won't be the last.
RASPicks,agree but still depends on terms and ability to get down.  if i can buy a pick for $30 and bet 3k on it would be better than giving 50 percent  to the originator.
RASPicks,we talk to and poll customers regularly closely monitor screen at every release etc. and that is what o you are experience has demonstrated.  btw we've never released openers or anything close to that.
RASPicks,btw if you'd like to see how the releases work and have a better idea of how viable the service is i would be happy to set you up with a comp.  good luck.

ClevTA,exactly. even tho i totally am ok with dorsey gone it doesnt mean that i have full faith in the haslams knowing what they are doing or getting anything right. both can be true
ClevTA,since 99 there have been 51 other instances of a in division home dog of 10+ like the browns. the dog is 7-44 straight up. 26-24-1 against the spread   for what  it is  worth
ClevTA,the good news is garrett thought it was better to go for it on 4th and 11 than 4th and 8 from the 11 with a chance to tie. its just so so awful
ClevTA,adjust for pass defenses faced. baker has faced zero bottom 10 pass ds in the nfl so far. lets wait till end of the year to see where his best gms will stack up
ClevTA,exactly! the spread was correct as i tried to explain. never said browns were covering just that the line was correct. everyones minds were blown bc all they look at is win loss record
ClevTA,if the jets were 2.5 prior to darnold news and ended up 6.5 a free throw er then u are saying mosley and williams account for 2.5  points ? this is why i ask
ClevTA,theres a diff between a backup like simien and someone like kizer. osweiller some undra free throw ed rookie. he at le assit has made big throws and won real games on the road

spanky,disagree. i've had many esports experts approach me wanting to become betting partners.  they think betting a football game is the same as betting a video game and collecting the winnings is so easy.

aluckyaday,"i guess they could argue that it is possible to ""bet savvy"" and n overtime be restricted. maybe bet savvy means betting with + expected value without triggering their algorithms that get accounts reviewed"
aluckyaday,sneaky change to sky's guarantee there. i only noticed it because the published price (premium price in the betslip) for soto sizzler was 5/1 when sky were actually offering 11/2 in their normal market!
joeytunes2,or be a bet365 and the rest of these legal places in nj or lv and choose to n overtime lose at at all. they cut down anyone with a small chance of winning.

EdMillerPoker,the interaction is what has the value anyway. once you have the interaction you can theoretically monetize it in ways other than purely convincing ppl to make very bad bets that aren't that fun
EdMillerPoker,real talk: u can say anything you want and if you put real talk in front of it you're good. anyone says anything about it u just block them for n overtime being real
EdMillerPoker,we're watching but it wasn't on o you are schedule that we were going to do. we're training some folks and ramping up o you are capacity to do simultaneous games at the moment.
EdMillerPoker,or put another way if one place has -150/+130 and another -170/+150 then you have all the info you need to conclude -170 and +130 are both likely to be worse than average bets.
EdMillerPoker,there's a zillion games and the limits are much lower and almost no one in europe bets it and for sure  it is  less efficient. hal free throw imes/in game also very much so.

less accurate than what?

JoeyKnish22,just hold for now. hopefully they win out and get the 1 and a so free throw er 4 seed. then hedge in the title game vs osu/clem. but too early to do anything.
JoeyKnish22,the lions are trying to do the patriots thing where they trade their good players who are about to get paid exce point  the big flaw is they dont have any other good players.

LockyLockerson,right but in the nfl aren't there plenty of teams who win a l overtime of games each year who  daily fantasy sports  win by much?  i get  years old you are point though.
LockyLockerson,i agree totally.  that is the permutation where alabama absolutely does n overtime get in.  probably something like osu-clemson-uga-lsu which also allows for uga/lsu to n overtime play each other again in the semi.
LockyLockerson,at what price is he n overtime worth a try? ive heard he was 120/1 then 100/1.  now 75.  seems unlikely we are still at the point where he is valuable in any way.

ToddFuhrman,the guys at circa have been great getting up numbers first.  i'm sure they saw a few dog bets but when the market opened prices have a tendency to normalize regardless of the shop

12Xpert,liquidity has nothing to do with proving whether betting performances are nearly random or otherwise. we are talking about risk-adjusted deviations from expectation (the bookmaker's margin) for example via t scores or z scores.
12Xpert,assuming  years old you are expectation was a loss equivalent to the bookmaker's margin for those odds (about -3 percent ) then a monte carlo simulation showed this probability was about 6 percent .
12Xpert,xg data is produced by a model using raw data like shots. i just provide the raw data. you are welcome to develop an xg model using the available data to build xg stats.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  care if he's f....g paul erds reincarnated he clearly hasn't g overtime a clue and is potentially deceiving followers by giving the impression via results and profits that he does.
12Xpert,"sure the way to ""[provoke] self-appraisal and self-reflection"" is n overtime via making fun and making people feel small and stupid. but as i said i'm no expert on this genuinely interested to learn."
12Xpert,i still intend to get to work on the analysis with opening pinny and bet365 odds again  it is  still probably oranges and lemons but will be interesting to see if there's any difference.
JambosPicks,the bloomberg sports article references bill miller (legg mason) marvin bush (winston partners) steve duncker (ex-nyra chairman and goldman partner) and david ganek as the people backing this. research referenced was around those individuals.
mschwimer,this i 100 percent  agree with. as i have always said. the gambling would unanimously disagrees with me. but i have seen numbers that suggest otherwise. maybe people arnt looking in the right places...
mschwimer,as always. if you dont believe what i say is true and you think we are n overtime winning bettors then put  years old you are money where  years old you are mouth is!
RufusPeabody,congr against the spread to jambos on this partnership. a win for salesmanship over honesty and transparency. looking forward to the day jambos actually gets a chance to book based on their models.
RufusPeabody,this is a very good point. and you should be betting a  percent  of  years old you are bankroll each bet n overtime a fixed amount regardless of  years old you are bankroll.
RufusPeabody,i havent seen a tweet mentioning  years old you are record on free thursdays but if you were winning on those we probably would hear about it. th against the spread the issue.
RufusPeabody,winston doesnt tilt me as much. at le assit he knows how to run a 2-minute drill and snap the ball with more than 3 seconds le free throw  on the play clock
RufusPeabody,"rangers batting up 6-1 in the t9. 2 on 2 out.

RufusPeabody,i just wish someone would actually look and see that nothing has changed in the 18 weeks. he's n overtime moving lines any more or less than he did in se point ember.
RufusPeabody,so if the guy who was the arbiter decided he saw enough to stay with the call on the field why would you think he would overturn it if he officially reviewed it?
SportsCheetah,no rondo and cook forced to trying to run backup point was a disaster but then they had to do it again second half anyway. pretty much the evidence there. it was ugly.

capjack2000,yes this will be their first foray into the us market. i'm interested to see how they approach it. iowa has the lowest barrier to entry ($45k) of any us market so far.
capjack2000,its all sharp liquidity. thatll be the biggest problem when sports exchanges finally happen. itll be all sharp no square. the public will get buzzsawed like they did with  daily fantasy sports .

capjack2000,millman did a l overtime for furthering the conversation that evolved into mainstream acce point ance of sports betting. im grateful for that. i think he cashed in his chips too soon though.
capjack2000,shockingly ben had it correct. 70 percent  of total handle. of course the devil in the details was that it encompassed a window where no live events were taking place (in north america).
capjack2000,they have the best marketing in nj and yet ive never seen a commercial or billboard. theyre much more tuned in to todays us bettor than the other larger companies in the space.
dinkinc,for the time put in the expected small profit is far less if i took a paper cup and stood on the corner for the same amount of time with far less varience
robpizzola,betting on sports and buying picks are two entirely different things. there are absolutely tons of rec players that bet on sports for the entertainment but buying picks is a much different intent.
robpizzola,"william nylander had the highest relative to teammate expected goal differential on the leafs this season. we are only talking about his ""lack of production"" because he had a 5.13 percent  shooting percentage."
robpizzola,ajax 3-2 on aggregate is flattering for juve. they were absolutely trucked over two legs. juve lucky that they capitalized on the only real chances that they had while ajax finishing was poor.
RASPicks,like i said yesterday just irks me to see such a strategy promoted to the masses.  such data is marketed and sold by multiple entities who want people to think it has value.
VegasRefund,if the vikings were to play in the super bowl how that would effect the market from a revenue generating standpoint for the city is one of the most interesting potential storylines imo.
suuma810,"dan quinn just said the three areas the falcons need to improve are turnover margin run offense and run defense. he wants his rush offense ""to provide the balance to make play-action go""."
suuma810,around 25th ish. yeah and i am pretty low on schottenheimer we  daily fantasy sports  have any evidence to assume he is going to help this offense. will solari make a real difference?
ClevTA,georgia hands down. what case would that be for bama? georgia would have beaten the team that beat bama and georgia would have 2 better wins (assuming ndauburn) than anything on bama's schedule
ClevTA,troy likes yards per completion. right i mean bc who cares if a qb goes 0-20 if his 21st attem point  goes for 50 yards that 50 yard per completion stat looks great!
CizzlingSports,ok thanks for creating that confusion i guess by responding to the issue of  changing his aggregate w/l total with an inapplicable explanation about the permission requirements for changes in featured bettors' records
spanky,"again you live in a bubble of regulated markets. 

i live in a world where my bets are placed on credit and there is no regulated body to turn to for dispute resolution."
spanky,interesting question. my guess is the the talent difference in teams is causing less competition which leads to less attendance and thus leads to less home field advantage. i honestly have no idea
spanky,"this one surprised me cuz i shook hands with men in charge and was told id never be cut.

a handshake in my business is stronger than steel - or so i thought."
spanky,"""if you are betting in-game bet only during timeouts""

very good advice to prevent bookmakers from freerolling on you.  their faster feed coupled with the delayed bet approval process is impossible to overcome."
spanky,correlation of my feelings is a little much. i disagree they are exactly the same. given the line was 5 to 1 n overtime losing was 5 times as self satisfying as winning
spanky,yeah looking back we were all dummies for believing the hype... the money i did lose was absorbed by royal sportsbook out of curacao which saved face for the industry at the time

aluckyaday,it does. my luckies have an expected return of 22 percent  based on bfsp. just learnt n overtime to count my chickens at 11am! seen all blue turn to red too many times
aluckyaday,i guess that would depend if you include decisions to hold. if you have 100 stocks in a portfolio and do a weekly review then over 400 decisions a month would mount up
aluckyaday,did n overtime say i disagree just said i did n overtime know if there is any correlation between a straightish line and skill or if there is any way to test it
aluckyaday,i wonder if they are actually allowed to use the data passing through the api for their own benefit? plus do they get to see the share of the bet the agent keeps?
aluckyaday,it has certainly made it easier to bet and increased the size of the market dramatically. large markets attract large corporates. sharps are an expense. in the corporate world minimizing expenses maximizes profits
aluckyaday,in response to the consultation the government  said they would cut stakes to limit harm but i can n overtime see where they said did it to prevent addiction in the first place.

nonrandomalpha,if we were getting daily updates on flu cases and deaths the market would have blown its brains out by now...this reaction is pathetic and the media (and you) stokes the fear further
nonrandomalpha,fans like you are part of the problem...this is worst case scenario: tru puts up decent numbers v sinking teams as season closes making 2020 another wasted year of this nonsense. fkn sad.
nonrandomalpha,we took broncos against chargers in both supercontest and circa a few weeks back. we arent anti-broncos...but market too high on broncos and too low on chiefs. both are late to the party.

LeeSharpeNFL,though wait if this were the case wouldn't you only apply the 1.2x multiplier to the divisional round games where teams are coming off a bye rather than all of the playoff games?
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  from nflscrapr which bases its model off what has happened in previous games based on similar score differential time (and timeouts) remaining possession down and distance and position on the field.
LeeSharpeNFL,i think this is where we may n overtime be aligning: my goal is n overtime to produce a champion that is the most deserving it is to create the best entertainment product.
LeeSharpeNFL,nagy is being aggressive for the most part i think and i'm into it but  it is  hard to get offensive success with trubisky even if he was the first half's better qb.
LeeSharpeNFL,agreed. the role of head coach in setting a direction for the organization is o free throw en discounted too much relative to how well he manages the xs and os (for example).
LeeSharpeNFL,i posted a tweet earlier today and while there have been some thoughtful replies that caused me to reevaluate some placements overall making a post like thst attracts wayyyyy too many trolls. yikes.

AndyMSFW,i watched those damn dirty birds steal the vikings super bowl appearance away in 1998 and i'm still considering buying a falcons jersey for this season.  i'm that high on them this year.
JoeyKnish22,you saw this joke in the comments and used it in a qt. thought you were above it. thought you were different. but youve turned into a kardashian stan account for likes. sad.
JoeyKnish22,"ive made 4 bets on baseball this year. total. theyve all lost. my utter hatred for the sport is well known. 

im on strausburg +160. i wont watch a single pitch. plan accordingly."
JoeyKnish22,went to live bet wake/ville but nobody has it available since the game is on acc network and only like 6 ppl with a knockoff satellite dish in taiwan actually get that channel.
JoeyKnish22,we had some tech issues so was a short segment at the end but talked some heisman and one game i really like this weekend (current number still bettable) with kostos and locky.
JoeyKnish22,lions defense could be low key real deal. rebuilt the dl. added de point h. found a sl overtime corner. patrica if nothing else had some solid defensive game plans/schematics l assit year.
TheKostos,no because of away goal differential. liverpool didn't score on the road. so if atletico score and liverpool win 2-1 they  daily fantasy sports  advance. if atletico score liverpool need 3 to advance.
TheKostos,"lots of #goodshit here.

chadmillman,at one point on this podc assit i said to pro bettor simon hunter who had just given a tip about betting strategy that is best piece of betting advice ive ever heard.
chadmillman,all credit for me beating  in o you are 3- point  contest bet to    for the prescient work with joe harris months ago. and of course to joe harris. but mostly to me.

chadmillman,because i am a giver an offer from  for new users in nj: bet $1 on  clemson or lsu to win  #nationalchampionship and win $150.  that is  right a bet on either wins.
Gingfacekillah,thanks! it seems to be a key feature of the game which i should make an attem point  at quantifying. even if its just to factor it in as a margin of error.
Gingfacekillah,its n overtime as sophisticated as stronger st against the spread programs but through automating sheets and combining them you can do some incredible things in excel. bootstrapping mle all kinds of things.

12Xpert,i'm n overtime defending it i'm simply being realistic. if you want change you need to both understand what strategy would be most effective and what the consequences of any change would be.
12Xpert,that is  a different story and an different argument. it has a l overtime of merit but i  daily fantasy sports  think it is served too well by joining it with this one.
12Xpert,seems about right. you'd typically expect about three 12s or more in 692 36 percent  bets but none is the most common. here's the probability distribution based on a 10000-run monte carlo simulation.
12Xpert,it is  a good question. unfortunately i'm n overtime eligible to bet at pinny so can't check limits. i suppose betfair exchange would be a good place to get a handle on turnover.
12Xpert,that would depend on how many bets they are having in that time. i agree profits are an indicator but only if you study what everyone else achieves doing the same as you.
12Xpert,actually to be fair i reported the earnings wage and n overtime the real wage which appears to have remained close to unchanged over the period but way outside these two scenario forecasts.
12Xpert,"were you aware that  closed their programme to ""all"" affiliates with one month's notice a couple of years back destroying years of had work under the pretence that they cared about problem gambling?"
12Xpert,it is  a positive thing and should be taken seriously but this still doesn't imply that gambling is bad any more than the need for eating disorder clinics imply that eating is bad.
12Xpert,he better start winning soon because there will be others who will want to take his place. personally i  daily fantasy sports  think he'll ever win a gs he's n overtime good enough.

dinkinc,he does n overtime handicap games...he doesn't like anything...he takes positive equity numbers by scanning over 2500 bookmaker's lines...  it takes a very high-tech mind to be 1/2 as good as him...
dinkinc,but trying to make huge scores is only good if you are a superior handicapper... of course everyone thinks they are.. also ticket construction is vital and most are terrible at that
dinkinc,it is  an important part of the american political climate.. i understand why in some cases it gives us a reason to live but it also gives us a reason to hate
dinkinc,no.  some people preach jesus as the answer to o you are problems. i think we lose o you are ability to fix problems when we hand them over to some god

robpizzola,i think  it is  a fair question. he was never an elite quarterback at any point in his career but he did have a long stretch of being average to above average.

robpizzola,saw dream theater in toronto l assit night. probably the best set ive ever seen them play. its unreal that any band can pull off something like this in a live environment.

suuma810,n overtime only do the #cowboys have a good pass rush already they are also getting dt david irving back from suspension. road-bottles will enter the game behind a banged-up offensive line.
suuma810,"2-2 on the first slate. beat on ravens over 44 made up for the browns win on thursday.

suuma810,"#seahawks on first down through week two:

27 passes 7.2 yards per play
24 runs 3.4 yards per play

i guess pete  brian will be working all week on establishing the run."
suuma810,yeah no way. i am comfortable with +3 but if you want to play +2.5 you can also take a decent ml. pinnacle has +133. difference of ~6 percent  in break even.
ClevTA,and what happens when u wait and miss the 2 with 5 seconds le free throw ? then what? th against the spread what youd rather have? why? makes absolutely zero sense
ClevTA,oh i sure do. i even made the case that when hunt came back they'd play both together bc he is an excellent receiver. michael salfino i guess is his name. enjoy!
ClevTA,oh so the guy who just missed a simple pat is an automatic  field goal  kicker? and im sure the entire game strategy changes so u cant just say they wouldve won
ClevTA,he has an awful and injured ol vs a top 3 pass rush. he wont have time to move it. and hodges is an unknown so should be low scoring type gm
ClevTA,yeah just saying for future reference the public does n overtime move lines ever. only sharp money will force a line to move off a number and more importantly a key number.

aluckyaday,give me what i want or i'll sho overtime myself in the foot. both feet even! sounds more like a monty python sketch than something that is being done in all seriousness!
aluckyaday,that is the reality there can really only be one sharp price (within vig). if 2 books that  daily fantasy sports  restrict differ arbers will quickly bring the prices in to line.
aluckyaday,do they really keep there prices lower than betfair at the moment? i would guess n overtime with early prices. i suppose it depends how and at what time it was implemented.
aluckyaday,general speaking to maximise bank growth you should modify  years old you are bet size a free throw er every bet based on  years old you are bank edge and the odds.
aluckyaday,i have no information on how they really work just reading between the lines from what marco and their traders have said in various podcasts/twitter chats. my theories might be complete bs.

JoeyKnish22,he would be a much better fit/better player. but i think he wants an outright starting job. costello will be in a competition with mccaffrey and probably go into spring as qb2.
JoeyKnish22,nobody wants to open nfl playoff lines a free throw er 17 weeks of football eh? a monkey could set these lines and n overtime be off by more than a point.
JoeyKnish22,probably 9.5 but i thought 10.5 would add more heat to the take and most ppl cant really do regular math much less live math so felt id get away with it.
JoeyKnish22,stevey baby. we need to have a quick convo on threading tweets. this is feeling very alan boston to me. i love the bama h overtime takes but lets get them organized.

DannyParkins,take the time and read it. theres some new and lots of old memories of the process each team had in dra free throw ing trubisky mahomes and watson. good stuff from
DannyParkins,feel free to sho overtime me a dm would love to talk to ya at some point privately about  years old you are criticisms and feedback of my work and the show.
DannyParkins,oh man... if this is the vehicle that leo jumps to tv with im all-in. if hes just on as an ep ill be bummed we didnt get him in the movie.
DannyParkins,yea i think the chiefs blow em out but i already have a nice 11.5:1 bet on them to win the super bowl from back in november so i didnt take it
chadmillman,saw the  bros uncut gems l assit night. jumps to top sp overtime of best sports betting movies. easily be against the spread james caan version of the gambler. what say you
chadmillman,its on the today page bottom le free throw  button. if you have a bet on a game the game appears on that page and during the game win probability is activated.
chadmillman,"ill play along ...

because no one has ever spent more than we have on a hockey betting preview show. have you seen o you are siren?! o you are license plate?!"
Gingfacekillah,thanks for the kind words martin i'm really glad you liked the sample! formatting this many pictures is a pain but i'm writing for hours every day - shouldn't be too long!
Gingfacekillah,yes there will. i think the kindle version will be more useful for readers trying to follow along in excel but both form against the spread will be available when its released.
Gingfacekillah,curious if you think  years old you are match rating methodology could be applied to pointspreads? using a frequentist approach to see the actual vs predicted probability success rate of various spreads?
logan_matthews9,yep just some small sample size noise i think. unless  years old you are model was picking up something important in terms of first half numbers - always a possibility to consider!
PikachuBets,bro you need to calm down with the tagging orgy every single week. he's a loser we get it. you g overtime ripped off sucks. can you stop tagging me now thanks
PikachuBets,"""here is valuable information that will help you win bets""

""i am n overtime a profitable bettor""

if you  daily fantasy sports  see a problem here you're just retarded. n overtime sorry"
PikachuBets,it is  n overtime self-defeating at le assit n overtime for me. my position is that comparing across eras is a useless exercise and doesn't provide any useful data at all. :)
PikachuBets,"does dick size correlate with intelligence or common sense? asking for a friend im just a pokmon so  i do n overtime know 

p.s. hes still n overtime gonna fuck you bro"
PikachuBets,must be nice to be so far removed from any part of the legit gambling world and live with this level of cocky delusion...and already fired from tan to bo overtime lmao
PikachuBets,"super fucking backed out. check my pinned tweet. he's a cuck through and through

 i know you're reading this so if you wanna make good on  years old you are word hmu"
adamchernoff,the equivalent odds at pinnacle and 365 were no where close to -110 / 1.90. they were all 1.65 and up. wclc has fixed odds of 1.70. what is the issue here?
adamchernoff,looking at only win/loss results can be troublesome in terms of evaluation/measurement because it shows very little about the process does little to illustrate the edge and clouds the line between luck/skill.
adamchernoff,"bet acce point ed. 

line is now 49 o-10 and youre limited to $1 risk pending account review. you must also supply sufficient documentation to unlock  years old you are account.

adamchernoff,"kick off  years old you are friday with a read of my weekly blog for

Ccon8181,youre right they are at different levels but id take butler or klay thompson over harden and leave cp3 and take my chances then try to build around harden as the 1.
kellyinvegas,doesnt look like i can get the flights to work out for the  also the line move in the game.  what the fuck . i dont want to go watch them lose
ToddFuhrman,everything is in play here. know  and  had no other o point ion a free throw er watching this display and always helps to get the first movers to tip their hand
ToddFuhrman,i wont claim to be overly knowledgeable on the sport but can appreciate greatness and the fact these guys rarely let down or all go cold at the same time is incredible
ToddFuhrman,ha n overtime sure politics are in my future in any capacity...now maybe president of a hoa at 70 to fine people for weeds and trash cans just to keep things fresh
ToddFuhrman,pochettino did pool a major favor as well by starting kane; was the easy choice to use him when in reality he was nowhere near fit to log 90 at moras expense
ToddFuhrman,a free throw er watching the nuggets earlier and the ra point ors right now you get an increased appreciation of how effortless the dynasty in golden st makes closeout situations look
ToddFuhrman,nothing is ever easy at bristol but liked the sp overtime we were in when the caution came out around 35 laps to go. kids an elite talent always fun to watch
ToddFuhrman,"hey zion ill pay you 2m for a 20 minutes celebrity appearance

so boosters can just cut checks to players for this; explain to me how th against the spread a solution?"
TheCousinSal,on an all-new against all odds podc assit the trifecta and i preview nfl week 7 best bets nfc north odds + we vote on the most cursed athlete of all-time. #gambling
TheCousinSal,the degenerate trifecta and i journeyed to las vegas l assit weekend and put together o you are nfl potluck propaganza podcast. i promise its n overtime as terrifying as it sounds.
TheCousinSal,heres pete rose telling my 5 year old to take a hike a free throw er he misfires on the tee. found out later that pete had bet $50 on a triple.
TheCousinSal,a free throw er much analysis ive decided to lay the point and a half. virginia is a team of destiny. they are destined to take all of my money tonight. #marchmadness2019
TheCousinSal,on an all-new #againstallodds the degenerate trifecta  i risk o you are  jobs by discussing how much nba tanking sucks. also antonio browns next team + best bets for the weekend. #gambling
TheCousinSal,id like to wish a happy and healthy thanksgiving to all of my twitter followers.  so th against the spread what im doing. also im testing out a new touchdown dance. thoughts?
TheCousinSal,just checked the math: belgium to win in regulation over japan (down 2-0) is 100x the p against the spread super bowl 51 comeback over the falcons...with 1/10th as much cheating. #worldcup2018
TheCousinSal,on an all new #againstallodds my degenerate trifecta  i break down the houston/gst odds pick a winner for the lightning/caps series + we bet on whether or n overtime  will lick again.
12Xpert,that is  always a dangerous assum point ion. i sometimes get asked a related question. what if i bet exchange prices when they are higher than pinnacle's fair (margin removed) price. (1/2)
12Xpert,how many customers has this actually affected? and if  it is  5 percent  (which would be roughly the figure if applied in the uk) what would be the impact on the industry?
12Xpert,i'd still expect the largest profits to be coming from the 2 percent  commission because these account for circa 80 percent  of bets and probably in excess of 95 percent  of volume.
12Xpert,you could choose to analyse the data for just these two leagues but you may n overtime have enough of it to eliminate variance that will influence  years old you are conclusions.
12Xpert,var is pointless if referees wont look at the video evidence and junior officials wont overturn decisions. premier league has g overtime it all wrong. a foul is a foul. the end.
12Xpert,but if you were aware of this you could make the request long before the result is known. of course theyll likely ignore you anyway unless they choose to void bets themselves.
12Xpert,if you think  that is  what i'm talking about and just want to insult because you  daily fantasy sports  like my point of view then  daily fantasy sports  bother carrying this on.
12Xpert,i'd have to think about that. i find lays intuitively hard to get my head around which is why i turn them into backs for the purposes of analysing a bet history.
12Xpert,sells a good story with his open acknowledgement the problem gambling is an important issue but as always the devil is in the detail. judge a bookmaker by actions n overtime words.
12Xpert,this is what is called regression to the mean. most important lesson a punter should learn short of knowing n overtime to chase losses and burning money they can't afford to lose.
12Xpert,"actually i  daily fantasy sports  argue that  i study the data and i see that for ""almost everyone"" there is nothing but chance. that is n overtime the same as saying ""everyone""."
JambosPicks,"a winning day to close out a winning week! heres how o you are monday plays went: 

mlb: 3 plays 2-1 +0.89 units
nfl: 2 plays (including vikings-packers/browns-jets teaser) 2-0 +2 units"
mschwimer,we have n overtime had a single subscriber complain that they were n overtime able to get that play in.  trust me we would have heard about it if they couldn't haha.
mschwimer,i didnt know a single person on espn. they found me because they followed jambos when we were free for everyone and they followed o you are picks. that is a fact.
mschwimer,either way. the new language 100 percent  covers the guarantee. no one can argue that. i do understand you think it isnt perfect. but you cant say it doesnt cover the guarantee.
mschwimer,i would love to hear from any bookmaker that their goal is n overtime to get equal action on both sides. if they do exist they are certainly n overtime the majority.
mschwimer,yes. but then we get lumped into the people i hate. touts. dont want to go 4-8 in a week then say this pick is 10 units and claim a winning week.
mschwimer,we dont have a nba model yet. n overtime sure if any model would work due to the durant unknown. but if i had to take a side id take the warriors.
mschwimer,you and me both. porcello was lights out. big swing and a miss in that game. if the rangers hold then  will be 3-2 on the day! will always take 60 percent
RufusPeabody,you publicly posted numbers. he graphed how they would have performed against the market. if you post win probabilities you cant be surprised if someone looks at if they have value.
RufusPeabody,please note that i asked what method we should use for selecting a *4* team playoff. i realize more teams would be better.  that is  n overtime what i was asking.
RufusPeabody,i met a guy in a sportsbook who said he bet for a living and then gave me his h overtime tip on the super bowl coin toss coming up tails.
RufusPeabody,new  from barcelona where  tries unsuccessfully n overtime to discuss a particular tout service we cover futures and teasers in de point h and give a few nfl/ college football  picks.
jeffma,oh i get it. if you know its a lemon than dont bet it. thanks. th against the spread good insight. do you have a website i can sign up for?
jeffma,that is a scary game for the warriors. they sh overtime a higher percentage overall and from 3 (47 percent  to 37 percent ) and lost. maybe this isnt over yet
jeffma,tout alert: congr against the spread to my  podcast partner  for his 6-0 week on college picks on the  pod. if only o you are nfl picks could be so good
jeffma,latest episode of  where  explains why he doesnt do parlays and we bask in the glory of his eagle futures... some thoughts on the iron bowl and whether the  are elite
SportsCheetah,the ball doesnt hit until the bottom of the net. its usually pretty instant relative to when it goes p assit the bars. would bet it was good for a lot.
SportsCheetah,if alex caruso were at the gym and wanted to play horse i'd ask him for how much. then he'd dunk like that and i'd take the l and go home.
SportsCheetah,i believe he was able to confirm this l assit night. what he hasnt been able to do is locate his younger brother that still owes me money from high school.
SportsCheetah,i have one that im confident in but were just trying to take advantage of betting lines here. i wouldnt go reporting it official or anything until the team announces it.
SportsCheetah,unfortunate to get the news during a week they  daily fantasy sports  have a game but i've been told texas tech qb alan bowman is going to be out 6-8 weeks.
capjack2000,different books are sharp for different things. ive been impressed by fd and pointsbet. one book i struggle to beat is resorts/betamerica/golden nugget. they use sbtech which just clones pinnys lines.
capjack2000,the $1.69m in expenses is a bit concerning. i could see startup costs being rolled into that first month but i also see some troubling expenses for such a low-margin industry.
capjack2000,well you wagered $22k and lost $1k  that is  a 4.55 percent  margin. there are operators out there that wouldn't be happy enough to only get 4.55 percent  out of you.
capjack2000,yes they have a bitcoin atm at the d (and probably at golden gate too). they are limited to rather low limits and the surcharge is typically around 9 percent .
capjack2000,"john randle placed a $93 bet on the twins -194 tonight to be the first bet at diamond jo casino in iowa. 

by ceremonial first bet standards its decent...but still...cmon man."
capjack2000,"monday morning musing

slow day on the betting markets so heres a thread on 5 things that nj sportsbooks (or any state) could do this nfl season to increase engagement:

1/7"
capjack2000,looks like thescore is getting very close to launch in nj. gathering their beta testers now. we're hopefully only days away from the first new voice on the scene since january.
capjack2000,i would argue that the sl overtime manufacturers are purposely creating games to attract sl overtime aps (igt knows what theyre doing). however linemakers arent making lines hoping to get beat.
dinkinc,he is selling c.m. punk in mma only in reverse.... he has no faith in creating wrestling stars.... the fiend is even worse...fake monsters... see what good that did for balor
dinkinc,i need a top 5 finish to get even for today.  i enjoy the contests.  i am sure you have some bad habits that some would find stupid.  do you drink?
dinkinc,2-1 for the  horses.... this month has been producing unusual boxscores every day but today was the weirdest.... 4 games totally 5 runs at some very unexpected ballparks and pitching matchups
dinkinc,no official dinkfund plays until august 1..... for the record today i played phils -27 and first 5 innings angels over 5 1/2-20...  remember all plays are made for the  horses
dinkinc,i know english is  years old you are second language so i will excuse  years old you are spelling... i just can't excuse you for admitting you used a buzzer however...
dinkinc,my solution to make hockey playoffs fairer ......  go back to seeding one through eight....reseed a free throw er each round..... give the better seed l assit change in every game
robpizzola,he literally cann overtime read a defense. relies on his coach to read the defense for him at the line of scrimmage. and hes woefully inaccurate. hes a nobody without mcvay.
robpizzola,i can't speak to the motivations of others. personally  it is  too difficult for me to focus on nfl  college football  mlb cfl and get prepped for nhl all at once.
robpizzola,yes. funny enough beat closing line in 15 of those 16 games. five of them went to  overtime or so and lost all five. just an insane run of bad variance.
robpizzola,based on my twitter polls i  daily fantasy sports  think you're in the minority. i just think that the people who  daily fantasy sports  like this season are far more vocal.
RASPicks,in an earlier tweet spanky correctly notes the challenges of finding and maintaining reliable outs.  another benefit of maintaining a winning service is mitigating the long term dependence on such outs.
VegasRefund,even though they probably wont be posted a for a week+.. i find myself checking multiple times a day to see if nfl dra free throw  props have been posted yet.
suuma810,the #patriots are 17-5 against the spread  as short home favorites under a touchdown since 2010. this includes a meaningless week 17 loss in 2014 when garoppolo played a full half.
suuma810,we took the #cardinals at +4.5 -110 yesterday. i think they are underrated in this sp overtime and josh rosen looks to be an upgrade at qb. read the write-up here:
ClevTA,to be fair i didnt watch the whole gm so maybe im speaking out of turn but there was a comparable qb in that same wind who wasnt nearly as awful
ClevTA,love when announcers say that. if i trust  years old you are defense wouldnt it make even more sense to go for it and trust them in case u miss? lol
CizzlingSports,(4/x)no lines prices rotation numbers individual picks etc. are attached to or specifically referenced in the report. in other words the report lacks foundation for what was actually audited. see also:
CizzlingSports,.(2/x) in addition 2/22/20 was another bridge-jumper. assuming all bets at -110 w/a $26517 buy-in and a remaining roll down to $17274 a follower had to put $16170 into play lol.
spanky,hey  . ill be in michigan next month. should i stop by  years old you are school and say wh against the spread up or go to the house instead. lmk
spanky,so you think its ok for a show who advises its audience that smoking is bad but then says this show is brought to you by camel cigarettes.  come on now.
spanky,i actually used my head to design algorithms to monitor prices and extract value from market inefficiencies.  i dont need to handicap a thing. thanks for  years old you are interest.
spanky,do 2000 games 47 percent 46 percent 45 percent ....  its gonna be super small close to 0 which is beyond the bad luck argument and instead promotes a solid fade.
spanky,"says i had bad behavior when i never even entered the joint. fact is they  daily fantasy sports  welcome winners... 
heres my 2nd nj banning: 

joe at  calling me a gentlemen!"
spanky,is probably the only place in vegas where i can go and bet without a costume.  that being said i do play dress up from time to time with my daughters
spanky,lead detective on my case did a radio interview on npr. n overtime once did he mention me booking anyone....why? because i am n overtime a bookmaker. heres the radio interview:
spanky,1) i dont brag 2) ill never be a tout - i make my living extracting money from bookmakers n overtime fellow bettors. 3) spanky is n overtime a stupid name!!!!
spanky,when my guys played at  they had a $1000 minimum window which was never enforced.  anyone know if th against the spread still there and if so is it ever enforced?
PlusEVAnalytics,"minassian was drawn into conversation through patient and clever questioning by det. rob thomas an investigator with toronto polices sex crimes behavioural assessment section.

so would you say the detective was.......smooth?"
PlusEVAnalytics,so my transaction sits in scheduled status for who knows how many hours during which the price of bitcoin can fluctuate wildly? tell me again why this system is so great?
PlusEVAnalytics,yes th against the spread a huge problem. its one thing to say regress to market but its non-trivial to decide by how much. to be covered in my article :)
PlusEVAnalytics,the difference is that im n overtime betting 60 percent  kelly because i made the 60 up out of thin air. im calculating it as a posterior estimate using bayesian inference.
PlusEVAnalytics,took a read through  model descri point ion - its n overtime bad but can be improved. 1 percent  actual roi on 17 percent  theoretical positive expected value seems about right.
PlusEVAnalytics,thought experiment - its the day a free throw er election day and bernie sanders is  years old you are president-elect. how much lower is the sp than it is today?
aluckyaday,you are actually part of the process of transferring that money from the so free throw  books profits to the sharp books. hence why they dislike players like you so much.
aluckyaday,it is a very good sign that you will be profitable. markets are generally more efficient at close than opening as more information is available. a couple of articles on it.
aluckyaday,in the uk we have the monopolies and mergers commission that look at all takeovers/mergers to ensure competition is maintained. do you n overtime have something similar at a federal level?
aluckyaday,"n overtime sure how ""a firm commitment never to have checks at the irish border"" is compatible with ""the regulatory zone must have the consent of those effected by it""? #brexit"
aluckyaday,ok. so maybe the client model weights new accounts as very sharp until they know otherwise that would make sense if as you say syndicates are doing it to manipulate prices.
aluckyaday,those two punters both can only bet on the exchange. where does the money come from to pay them their long term winnings and cover the running costs of the exchange?
aluckyaday,i doubt very much there is the edge in the place only markets. the place market price will n overtime be the same as the place part of the each way.
theFirmAISports,"revisiting nfl season win totals -

15-10 ~ 60 percent 

investment = 2460*size
return = +540*size

roi = 22 percent  

need to make a quick trip back down to  
#nfl #sportsbetting"
theFirmAISports,thanks. the code is up on o you are github but the x axis is different for each metric along the y axis. but most are percentages or other b-ball stats.
joeytunes2,when she thought i was a square i g overtime offered shorts h against the spread limos. and 10k a game. now i'm good. i dont get paid haha. good stuff
joeytunes2,theres a little more then numbers here though. i hate both teams tbh. green bay gets buy week and hfa. seattle b2b travel and one of them being e assit coast.
joeyisaks,if u looked at his arm in the review its n overtime on the footbal when wrapped around his body and both hands were on football when he g overtime ball
EdMillerPoker,lol my dad was a professor there for maybe 10-15 years? and for a while they would fire him and then rehire him every year for some budget cut/insufficient funds reason.
EdMillerPoker,it is  the same deal if you just pick one side and bet it. you're running headlong into this negative selection bias on which bets you actually get acce point ed.
EdMillerPoker,n overtime surprised found a bunch of useful strategy nuggets myself doing that and i knew they were novel bc i could search and see if anyone else was using them
EdMillerPoker,like what if you i  daily fantasy sports  know gameified the experience? where the book bargains with you and trash talks you and offers you wacky prop bets during the game?
EdMillerPoker,then you should check out o you are website  all day as we make hal free throw ime lines for every game and in-play lines for a l overtime of them
EdMillerPoker,ha. glad you liked the video. ive been doing sports stuff for the l assit few years so im n overtime sure but id bet that yes theyre still pretty terrible
EdMillerPoker,i dont know what needs to be done to reduce the latency but i gotta figure that if they build this theyll figure out soon enough that latency matters a ton?
EdMillerPoker,there's a v short supply of talent in the us to work the operator side of things at the moment.  that is  what happens when you make things illegal for decades...
GolcondaFund,damn! g overtime home was gonna hop on this then baby daddy duty kicked in and mavs were already up 13 by time g overtime to look at live line...wah wah!
LeeSharpeNFL,"i really hate the ""highest paid x in the nfl"" meme though.  that is  in raw dollars n overtime inflation-adjusted and n overtime what truly matters (percentage of the salary cap)."
LeeSharpeNFL,why?  it is  kind of insane if you were going to keep him before the pick but a free throw er it want to let him go.  it is  one play.
LeeSharpeNFL,the bengals and giants at le assit have good dra free throw  picks to improve their situation. we are cap strapped have low dra free throw  capital and a terrible quarterback.
LeeSharpeNFL,a free throw er experiencing like 36 hours of consecutive rain in seattle i am extremely jealous that you are somewhere where touching a bottle of sunscreen is a reasonable decision.
LeeSharpeNFL,finally a good week in the 538 contest! this has been a rough year for my model unfortunately. hoping to get into the 90th percentile in the l assit two weeks.
LeeSharpeNFL,"if you had told me 2 years ago this is what would be said 2 years for now it would have filled me with glee.

now...  it is  a little terrifying."
LeeSharpeNFL,"it sounds like you're agreeing with me?

i'm n overtime saying he's a bad player i'm saying the trade was bad because  it is  n overtime converting to the desired outcome."
LeeSharpeNFL,"if the eagles g overtime in on the tiebreaks i would have said the same thing.

you know in  years old you are heart this division is a ball of failure."
LeeSharpeNFL,makes you wonder whether most agree and think kickers  daily fantasy sports  matter or whether they just really want rbs to matter and  daily fantasy sports  care as much about kickers.
LeeSharpeNFL,"since the black cat came out in the cowboys/giants week 9 game cat teams are 0-12.

remember this next time you post a low sample size ""trend"" like it means something."
LeeSharpeNFL,dakota weights runs fairly passing dvoa ignores them and qbr over-values them. this seems like the right order given that? e.g. i think ignoring them is probably better than over-valuing them.
LeeSharpeNFL,if it helps some people but n overtime others the effect should be measureable over a large sample. it doesn't have to apply to every instance to show up as predictive.
whale_capper,i'd imagine the handle for the final is going to be significantly higher (5x?) than their outright exposure but i  daily fantasy sports  have insider knowledge on that kind of stuff
AndyMSFW,as was hoped for on  podc assit dimitrov did indeed land in the 2nd quarter of the   at the recommendation of co-host  we'll add a little grigor +2500 for the week.
JoeyKnish22,well youve been sports betting for 5 years. but....you pick an over. or an under. if you pick under and it goes under the total listed. you win. and vice versa.
JoeyKnish22,i dont necessarily disagree but i wouldnt lock up the capital that long for a -110 when youre n overtime even guaranteed value and it will likely be minimal at best.
JoeyKnish22,if you bet one or both of these goys with me preseason (where number went against us for various reasons) can get off now live for a middle if ya like.
JoeyKnish22,interesting the owner water carriers (nfl media) never ran with this. good for wagner dont need to lose 3 percent  of  years old you are money if you dont have to.
JoeyKnish22,based on the source (zone been serving up lamar kool-aid for 3 years) i tried to brush it aside all offseason but that harbaugh quote hit me right in the veins.
JoeyKnish22,like any good old school caveman manball coach im sure at the first sign of any spread system fault hell revert to power footbaw and ruin the season with fullback dives.
JoeyKnish22,i believe the data was acquired from bwin sportsbook (dont allow us customers) so i really have no idea on the policies of that book. study was from 2005 as well.
JoeyKnish22,i get it you dont want to h2h vs uncle knish in  college football  dont blame you. either that or youve lost confidence in  years old you are boys very sad.
TheKostos,i mute the twitter slaps who think everyone should win 90 percent  of wagers and if you're n overtime covering the entire game then  it is  n overtime a real winner
TheKostos,what a dumbass team. imagine n overtime putting him on ir to start the season and wasting a roster spot. imagine still n overtime deactivating him!!! its almost thanksgiving! youre 0-10!
TheKostos,i think halep wins but i feel more confident it happens in three sets. i  daily fantasy sports  think she gets to the final without having dropped one. over 22 (-120)
TheKostos,i was also hoping for the punt but i think conchairto was even better with the way they built to it with the teased chair shots and how edge sold it
LockyLockerson,fun update: cincy now all the way to 6.5 still taking tiny bets by the bucketload.  at 7 is where i'd stop but let see where everyone else's head is at.

DannyParkins,the bulls are finding new ways to lose late against teams they need to be better than at this point of rebuild x. awful start to the year of playoff expectations.
DannyParkins,congratulations to the best professor at  there are countless of the biggest and smallest names in broadcasting who credit the best real world lessons they took from college from john nicholson.
DannyParkins,oh man kd heading to the locker room. steph now would be a good time to snap outta whatever the hell funk this is or the warriors are in real trouble.
DannyParkins,finally g overtime to this story on ned yost by  which for people who only know him for his in game strategy will be a bl assit to read. good stuff.
DannyParkins,about to play pickup ball for the first time in a lonnng time. keep me in  years old you are thoughts so i dont show up to #scorehouse with an injury.
DannyParkins,this is a great cause and it costs less than a trip to chipotle to send a kid on a to you are theyll never forget. please help if you can.
Gingfacekillah,"if you've read ""who's #1?"" and are interested in exploring the team ranking methods from the book in r comperes and comperank are two packages you should install and experiment with."
Gingfacekillah,exams complete. finally time to get back to sports and dive into to this book by  lots of crossover between o point ions and sports. thanks to  for the book recommendation!
Gingfacekillah,defense goes up hca goes up refereeing gets worse among other things. forecasting playoff games is tough to make + expected value imo. best of luck the rest of the season!
Gingfacekillah,i've g overtime it projected as :  million 5.94 laa 4.52. first sh overtime but it doesn't look awful. i'm taking the  moneyline on this one. tiny amount for a test.
Gingfacekillah,garbage in garbage out. without having a basis for the causality of  years old you are model features you might as well be handicapping based on the players assit rology signs.
Gingfacekillah,just read  years old you are work on this. great stuff. any ideas on how to address underdispersion for the home teams and over dispersion for the away teams? (nhl data):
logan_matthews9,"what a finish. 

i bet reed had some fantastic odds a free throw er those second shots on 18

very glad i dont have any of these on an outright ticket"
logan_matthews9,im n overtime really sure you understand hard capped. the only negative is that it helps the celtics but maybe the memphis pick would convince them. i do think its unlikely
PikachuBets,"""i have no doubt liberty is going to be a top 10 team by end of the year""

lol ok. are you willing to book a bet with me on this?"
PikachuBets,this is so dumb and the fact that youre gobbling up this bullshit marketing tactic of his really shows how intelligent you are which is to say n overtime at all
PikachuBets,hey now im a penn guy at heart and we were way more ghetto than yale ever was at its peak. brotherly love had a different meaning for us back then
adamchernoff,"i took a bigger than usual position on a side earlier this week for sunday in my  column. a case of numbers vs narrative in many ways. 

write-up and breakdown below"
adamchernoff,"an interesting poll result to say the least...

i will do my best in the thread below to illustrate why closing line value is the right answer in this thread below"
adamchernoff,obvious downsides of the tool above in the thread are lineup changes weather and any platoon advantage. game notes inside expanded game detail will highlight anything significant to take into account.
adamchernoff,how much for a season long package? how many bets do you average per day and where is  years old you are documented record for the l assit 6 seasons posted?
adamchernoff,"my first bet of the nfl playoffs is up in the slack channel and markets are on the move. 

if youre n overtime already in the channel you can join here:"
adamchernoff,well th against the spread a kick in the teeth. jets +3 goes down as a loss for myself and readers of my blog for  giving back -1.10x on the week.
Ccon8181,i dont know why embid gets so much pub. guy is a slug. barley makes it up and down the court some nights. but then again regular season #nba #miavsphi #sixers
Ccon8181,good point. but it was never available at better then +3 at cg. it also was mostly +3 -120 which is slightly better then +2.5 -110 but i missed that number.
Ccon8181,#texans are toast... spotted them 6 on turnovers now #bills going in for more. couldve ran them out of the building but o brien loves milking 10 741 point leads. embarrassing
Ccon8181,i used to think #cavs put too much blame on  ... but a free throw er l assit few years dude is just so free throw . its hard to watch.
Ccon8181,#pacers with the late comeback a free throw er #raps went prevent offense lol. g overtime the cover. 1-0 on the day. good end to the week. on to the next
kellyinvegas,trust me id love to fade them but everything im hearing outta carolina isnt good. pissed rivera g overtime fired. and l assit week it looks like they flat out quit.
kellyinvegas,bro its a trend. this is from a database. no one is saying they hit 79 percent . hes saying this particular trend is 79 percent . geez. math. is. hard.
kellyinvegas,baylor helped saved some face. if the l assit two come in on the card for  and what i gabe o you are on  all will be right in the world
kellyinvegas,that was great info. big money came in at 7. had multiple chances to cover that game. dont be that guy. just be happy to cash a ticket against the rlm
ToddFuhrman,reduced juice the way to go unfortunately a l overtime of those outs have begun drying up across the board but somewhere they'll make a comeback (or we can only hope)
ToddFuhrman,id rather do away with a non conference game against directional school u but no doubt expanding the season too far would have a negative impact on them; i respect that
ToddFuhrman,see so you're anti equality when it impacts  years old you are financial welfare...better be careful a l overtime of people will come a free throw er you for that opinion
ToddFuhrman,we aren't disputing that but then why would anyone play a non-conference game against anyone from the fbs let alone a power 5...sport doesn't need more fluff in se point ember
ToddFuhrman,and here i was trotta holding out hope you were one of my remaining beacons of light in media a free throw er being indoctrinated by massholes; all hope now lost
ToddFuhrman,wont argue that for a second he looked like the guy we saw that won the west a few years back. shocked that was the goal that g overtime by flower
12Xpert,indeed so but n overtime the best to level stakes. that hono you are goes to norwich by virtue of beating manchester city. liverpool are 4th. (lsp = level stakes profit).
12Xpert,lots of players will outperform xg the question is whether that is luck or something else.  that is  why i'm interested in seeing the distribution and who are in the tails.
12Xpert,it is  hard to say without the specific prices but at a guess the fair price would be around 220 so 280 would hold an expected value of 27 percent .
12Xpert,maybe i've g overtime it all wrong. maybe  it is  only customers with nigel as a middle name who get restricted. but we  daily fantasy sports  know coz it doesn't say.
12Xpert,thanks but i rather suspect that if no one else at  is the slightest bit interested at resolving this i doubt they would either. but i will give it a go.
JambosPicks,it was a risk fading patrick corbin and the red-h overtime #n against the spread but the #orioles pull off the upset and get jambos subscribers a with on the ml!
mschwimer,ill take that as a thank you for listening to my concerns and making the changes i requested. i have nothing else to say so i will needlessly make up bs
mschwimer,we dont make bets. and i can promise you. it is n overtime the player in my talking. the modelers have found things i really wish i knew as a player.
mschwimer,anyone with a brain would think its ridiculous. glad the nj books have common sense and do things the right way. vegas needs to ada point . its simple common sense.
mschwimer,all solid comments. rufus do live lines even exist at that time of the game? if so would love to know what pit to win down 3-0 in the 9th were.
RufusPeabody,excited to announce i'm looking to hire an analyst to o you are betting team. putting together a job listing which i should have ready in the next few days.
RufusPeabody,schwimer told me his week 1 line was philly -13 over skins with their v2 model. their v1 model had it -6. so were dealing with that level of precision.
RufusPeabody,so they're treating it like  it is   ~ 16/1. if you want to lay the no on fleetwood at pinnacle  that is  -1469 so that doesn't seem outrageous to me.
RufusPeabody,the crazy thing about that is that looking at the *actual* weather observations (n overtime on-course but close by) i would never have expected the effect would be that large.
jeffma,we have had offers but have turned them all down... we're waiting for the right partnership that will help improve o you are content and grow o you are reach
jeffma,unless you are planning to tout i dont understand why people would care about others doubting their ability to win long term. i have to harass  into saying anything publicly
jeffma,latest episode of  where  tries to follow up on his toutalicious 9-1 ncaa college football record and we discuss holy cross legend  okay n overtime really. we discuss gordie lockbaum!
SportsCheetah,i dont think anybody did but oregon/utah/bama/uga each lost down the stretch. n overtime sure what else they do this season there for #4 without saying the losses dont matter.
SportsCheetah,for what  it is  worth  (and i asked him to prove otherwise which he won't be able to do because i was up the show as a whole was not)
SportsCheetah,it really is. they get to upsell items like this at a super-premium too and the consumer is willing to pay it for the opportunity to own a small-medium piece.
SportsCheetah,"charles: ""i was wrong i thought they were going to be a 7 or 8 seed... they won't even make the playoffs.""

one half into the season against the clippers."
SportsCheetah,ive done a few podc assits recently + weve been discussing them on daily wager. also will have a few i like best in an article/preview that comes out tomorrow.
SportsCheetah,the buffs have so many guys out defensively i'd be inclined to wait and potentially bet 2h under if  it is  a blowout but definitely wouldn't bet u61 right now.
capjack2000,the systems it can build are narrative based trends afaik. i suppose there is some value to it for a savvy user but i wouldnt term it the rosetta stone.
capjack2000,"actually stadium casino llc (a completely unaffiliated company) received permission to open their online sportsbook in pa before their bm is open. 

nothing to do with lincoln financial field whatsoever."
capjack2000,actually the consensus spread has been 7.5 largely all week. additionally 8  9 are pretty dead numbers. so a move from 9 to 7.5 is n overtime a significant move.
capjack2000,"new wrinkle for betmgm is an edit my bet feature. you can change  years old you are bet add parlay legs or remove parlay legs on some open bets. 

interesting."
capjack2000,no. very different. entity wagering in nv has only one book willing to take the wagers (cg) and is full of guys touting fake records and falsified roi percent .
dinkinc,i am going with brody...lee and atlas.....if i was booking i would have jake win...the fans love him and would love him more chasing the title when cobb turns heel
dinkinc,recovering from day 1 bola..  highlight was seeing my friend   make his  debut and hanging with the always lovely  .. also brought in 3  first timers.  would have been proud
dinkinc,my favorite part of this trip were two things that happened at this padre game. i g overtime a complement for my  tee shirt and recognized as a pwg regular
dinkinc,i thought about you when i went through a list of people who i would miss... with you being in l.a. again i am sure we will always be friends
dinkinc,pictures or discussions of barbaro's passing slays me every time it comes up... i was a constant reader of his daily updates which would get more and more positive.. sucked
robpizzola,this is an epidemic in both the nfl and college football right now... anything that is remotely close to a first down is being consistently marked as a first down.
robpizzola,if i tuned into that third quarter without knowing the score of the game i would have thought the saints were the team that was down fo you are touchdowns.
robpizzola,sure but what if  it is  a surprise inactive? and also for the most part probably a bad idea to wait on any bet that you have an edge on.
robpizzola,"still tilted.

everyone crapping on gb offense a free throw er playing chi  minutes and den defenses.

everyone praising gb defense a free throw er playing trubisky cousins and flacco."
robpizzola,he did but teams really figured out how to play against juve. put a man on pjanic and juve is unable to create anything through the middle of the pitch.
robpizzola,likely going to do a nhl playoffs periscope at some point tomorrow night (probably around 7:00). i'll also post my series win probabilities a free throw er i bet them.
RASPicks,week 6  college football : 3-4 -1.4 units. now 42-21 +19.90 units y touchdown . 2nd half plays 0-2 now 6-8 y touchdown . play by play recap here: .co/fep1ovn3
VegasRefund,who is the best player on the rams dline/defense (and nfl)? aaron donald. is he capable of taking over a game with the potential of having a defining moment? yes.
ProfessorShine,free advice greg: there is zero about  or kelly that u need to fill a show.   their p assit is unnecessary baggage filled with shady sales tactics and fake records.
ProfessorShine,i have this dream where im a part of the committee and i get to pick dukes region.  it would have more landmines than bosnia.   and be in the west.
ProfessorShine,id like to think legal would cut down trafficking.  but n overtime something ive devoted a ton of time to.  im busy losing 19 point  leads in nba ya know
suuma810,oj howard was on pace for 54-904-8 with a l overtime of ryan fitzpatrick l assit year but bruce arians  byron le free throw wich pretend he doesn't exist. crazy.
suuma810,there isn't a l overtime n overtime to like imo. the offense looks stacked outside of both tackle positions some weak spots on their secondary. however the hype is huge.
suuma810,habe ich keine daten zu. aber man sollte es nicht gegen eine gute run defense callen wenn man whrend der zweiten hl free throw e mit zehn punkten hinten liegt.
suuma810,dont know how the #dolphins  #texans are going to combine for 46+ points tonight th against the spread why we took under 45.5. read my write-up on todays matchup here:
suuma810,just realized the #patriots didn't punt didn't commit a penalty and needed 43 points to beat the #chiefs at foxboro...without their starting center (only 22 snaps) and right guard (ir)!
suuma810,lookahead power rating lines totals and situational angles for week 2 have already been posted in the members area. become a suuma member and find value as early as possible!
ClevTA,right i get that but did they ask him about the browns job too? saying dallas is the best job doesnt negate any other job especially his home town tm
ClevTA,wait a minute. dallas is favored next week?? u are going to have to educate me on that one. as someone who bet dallas heavy today i dont get it
ClevTA,window dressing works! there are st against the spread out there that teams that use ore snap motion whether they hand the ball off or n overtime have better outcomes
ClevTA,seems like just a matter of when n overtime if the browns deal for a lt. now they have an extra 4th rounder as a sweetener for williams or whomever
CizzlingSports,i'm sure  $99/year subscribers are thrilled clay sold them a 1 unit play on the psu under while giving it out as a 3-unit play to the plebes for free.
CizzlingSports,".you could have only g overtime it at  if you are a pa/nj resident and only for $100 max.

 giving out ""blood bank guarantees"" on something with a $100 limit...."
CizzlingSports,lol yes an o free throw en overlooked fact that car played the afc south nfc e assit and obv its own division all of which were trash that season.
spanky,i find it fascinating how much svp caress about proving his handicapping superiority to some random twitter dude.  the monday luxuries of betting monopoly money... back to doing my figures
spanky,i completely disagree with you. trying to bet that and get away with it is stealing.  one of the few places le free throw  in nj that let me bet.
DocBettor,"thanks  for that 3 pointer. n overtime pictured - all the losing props i made at other places to create the aforementioned synthetic ""close game"" bet (but still profitable overall)"
DocBettor,thanks for sharing all of these   what do you have if wisconsin wins now? might've missed it but i think that would be scenario (6) oregon/ou/lsu/clemson/wisconsin # college football playoff
DocBettor,"in november i ran extremely well and made significantly more money gambling than from my day job.

december so far is reminding me to n overtime quit my day job."
DocBettor,they also have p against the spread to win afc at +220 so might as well do that unless you think they'll be shorter than -167 in the conference final?
PlusEVAnalytics,be nice to me or ill write a scri point  to flood you with geolocation requests and bankru point  you now well see how much jersey  really has in him
PlusEVAnalytics,and maybe that is the resolution to this whole thing. schwimers bets are mediocre but assuming he pays out his guarantees his customers are on track to generally do well.
PlusEVAnalytics,what is it about the end of this bridge - little bass riff into modulation into 4 chord guitar progression - that triggers every pleasure center in my brain? #armchairmusicologist
PlusEVAnalytics,offering a guaranteed prize pool for a tournament is a low key evil genius move. the overlay is the football the book is lucy and we are all charlie brown.
aluckyaday,want to know why there are problems in the nhs? this graph pretty much sums it up. i'm guessing other public services look the same. must be the immigrants fault!
aluckyaday,why? would n overtime dailys example become a pro too? that is the issue with survivorship bias. if you have enough people trying some will get there by luck alone.
aluckyaday,another 2-2 computer did n overtime learn.  l assit week the giants this week the browns! season now 12-7-1 (started week 2) more mean revision  now only 63 percent .
aluckyaday,looks like international companies are well pr expected points added red for a no deal brexit. pretty simple really. if it happens we will just move out of the uk!
joeytunes2,from a pure pr perspective clemson is favored. this is where you find value. if clemson is getting points you bet  years old you are ass clemson will take money.
joeytunes2,nope. i didnt know if it was just me. the counter will take a dime or 2   that is  it.  i mean its at le assit a diff line set.
joeytunes2,"well if i get injury news or so. i do go a free throw er it..so my ""n overtime chase steam"" isnt entirely true. theres many things in my arsenal."
joeytunes2,haha i bitched at what i thought was rush street gaming but i agree..the greed with these places..i wouldn't even dare sign up...always has the worst number.. bad business model
joeytunes2,"also might take lsu. if 7. these sec teams too much.  but hate favs late.

n overtime sure if i gave out iowa plus 7 but also will be endulging"
joeyisaks,dating is so different based on so many factors such as city / looks/ economic status . its very hard if you solved it but excited to click this link
EdMillerPoker,interesting. i see a parallel in that the skill sets needed to get to the top of both gambling and music arent necessarily the obvious skill sets for either field.
EdMillerPoker,it is  a much harder product to price than the equivalent tennis product. o point ions are to slap a huge hold on it or go down the rabbit hole.
EdMillerPoker,maybe i  daily fantasy sports  know enough about the various arguments to say but i read the article and it seems to be debunking claims no sane person would make?
GolcondaFund,why we play live. michigan +180 down 7 in 2nd quarter a free throw er 2 fluke  touchdown s by gator d. gator o line g overtime handled all game.
nonrandomalpha,jackson buying into his own hype  love it - the reversion to standard operating jackson in the weeks to come v no the dolphins will be a delight to see
nonrandomalpha,as a bears fan im embarrassed by the coaching staffs obsession with that play. it didnt define the season or the team. agree with what the article implied...move on already.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i said trivial because i knew someone would go "" it is  n overtime literally zero fluky thing x could happen"". instead saying it has cause the reverse conversation ;/"
LeeSharpeNFL,"of course not. my model still gives hou a 2.4 percent  chance to win the afccg and ten a 1.7 percent  to win the afccg.

those aren't great odds though."
LeeSharpeNFL,"obviously you have n overtime lived the bears fan life of seeing  years old you are qb throw it deep and being like ""oh no oh no plz plz plz"""
LeeSharpeNFL,the only thing keeping the bears in this game is matt patricia's cowardly punting decisions which are particularly embarrassing given the quality of offense it suggests he is worried about.
whale_capper,part 2 implying that you can ascribe motivation angles to nfl teams is much more controversial and no way will you find consensus among people who know this market well
whale_capper,deep dive into the womens world cup is live... action is underway on friday and we break down the field groups and outright markets hitting all the handicapping angles... enjoy!
AndyMSFW,this is 1000 percent  a touchdown for philly.  but either way we're just blessed to see one of the two le assit reasonable fan bases in sports lose their minds.
AndyMSFW,this is like the scene where paul newman realizes he's being hustled by forest whitaker in the color of money.  you see what happens when you lose a half-step joseph...
AndyMSFW,the price on the watney play was -117 the 3balls are at bovada the maker's mark has been flowing.  everything i've ever bet on golf including tomorrow is in here:
AndyMSFW,"the best part of friday is the cut!
today's h2h's went 1-1
cut-determined full-tourney h2h's went 4-2
couple outrights and t20 bets very much alive heading to the weekend.  #talkinggolf"
AndyMSFW,"huge apologies and thanks for understanding.  n overtime only the holiday but the people at  arrangements say that their insurance won't allow them to deliver to ""that part"" of detroit."
AndyMSFW,"just a way to make multiple parlays.  if you ""round-robin"" 4 teams you're making a four-team parlay 4 three-team parlays  6 two-team parlays.  it makes all eleven combinations for you."
JoeyKnish22,well th against the spread what everybody in the office is calling it internally. if you werent out sipping strawberry margs on the beach all day you would know this.
JoeyKnish22,also  is doing hourly black friday specials. so as youre at home on the couch in a food coma friday keep checking in to see what they g overtime going.
JoeyKnish22,looks like ill be staying dry this weekend a free throw er uncle knish put a little closing line value in  years old you are easter basket 5 months ago.
TheKostos,matt gay has missed three extra points. a field goals worth of xp. he's going to screw this over up and be the biggest piece of shit this nfl season
TheKostos,one-loss oregon or utah as pac12 champs getting in if georgia loses. the question will be: what happens if uga be against the spread lsu in sec the title game?
TheKostos,espn should just simulc assit tvg so the nation gets it. who wouldnt rather watch horse racing than max kellerman breaking down the coronavirus for the 100th time that day?
TheKostos,omega/hangman vs. the bucks was just outrageously incredible. five stars six seven whatever. incredible. and the right team won for the story. cant wait to see how it evolves. #aewrevolution
TheKostos,damien n overtime winning mvp in 54 is like james white n overtime winning for 51 or justin tuck n overtime winning for 42 (did i say that out loud?)
TheKostos,i want a game where i'm n overtime covering fo 59 minutes and then cover at the end. give me bullshit. give me bullshit. give me to me you asshole
TheKostos,i would really like a bullshit win. just once i want a bullshit win. all i get are bullshit losses. give me a bullshit win you son of a bitch
LockyLockerson,yep! it bills when you join and then the first of every month so you can feel free to wait til 1/1 or a free throw er if you want
LockyLockerson,"it is  that time again... widely-available  college football  things i bet for saturday a two-parter this week... part 1:

LockyLockerson,the best part is flowers telling the official a free throw er the first one exactly what hes doing and how its n overtime a penalty then gets flagged again
LockyLockerson,also no one probably really cares right now but 2 pretty big results for win total positions (if you read the guide)...washington losing another game already and louisville beating bc.
LockyLockerson,today's book update: the #1 new release in sports gambling books on amazon and pre-orders have been the key to that.   let us  get some more!  nom nom nom nom.

DannyParkins,a little birdie told me bears fans will really enjoy  open at 2:00 and 5:00 today. if youre n overtime that into bears/packers yet my guess is hell change that.
DannyParkins,ill bet you the spread no problem on that game for any amount you want yes with the caveat of massive injury really just to lawrence etienne simmons or higgins.
DannyParkins,youve gotta be seriously insecure to read that as a knock on mahomes man. relax my opinions on pat are well documented. i dont troll my former listeners or anyone.
DannyParkins,oh man 90 yard  touchdown  run for travis etienne hes gonna put up absolutely monster numbers this year given teams wont be able to ever stack the box against him.
DannyParkins,yoan moncada is on a ridiculous tear to start the year which is the single best thing the white sox could've hoped for out of the gate. great to see.
DannyParkins,most if n overtime all penalties are technically judgment calls so yea offsides would fall into that even though  it is  one of the more black/white ones... sorry dee ford
chadmillman,"doing the pregame show on  this season with live line moves + big bets coming in was thrilling. excited to bring this to more stations. appreciate 
 
 for putting it together."
chadmillman,if tyler bray comes through for you to seal the over 32.5 have you already spent all  years old you are karma for the season? or is it a sign?
chadmillman,a year ago today i had lunch with who told me about this sports betting media company he wanted to start. we're together in an  team meet today. crazy year.
chadmillman,were going live from  at 5est to talk about every betting angle with me  and  wh against the spread  years old you are most pressing prop question for the show?
chadmillman,i g overtime it at 30-1 in december when it was still one of le assit likely. had to beg bookmaker scooch at the orleans to post it for me.
Gingfacekillah,"cha point er 8 at page 64. i had to bury the download section in the middle of the book to keep it out of amazon's ""look inside"" website feature."
Gingfacekillah,this out-sample roc curve  for the nba looks pretty good until you realize the books are generally 1 percent  ahead of you. important to keep these model benchmarks in mind.
Gingfacekillah,thanks! those are  years old you are standard poisson probabilities for each team. the tricky part is forecasting the appropriate lambda for each team. bad lambda = bad probability forecasts.
Gingfacekillah,by the way same. i share some of what im doing and what i know in order to connect with other sports-minded forecasters. you can always learn something from others.
Gingfacekillah,all the research seems to acknowledge that it cant be done precisely for the reason you just mentioned. but methods like the logarithmic method do appear to be good approximations.
logan_matthews9,i like a handful of these plays but a l overtime seem too heavily weighted towards week one. how much is l assit week impacting  years old you are model?
logan_matthews9,who is hyping? long is one of the best defenders in the league which translates to roughly a mid-table epl side. th against the spread n overtime hyperbole its reality.
PikachuBets,bro u r rite i totally agree dealing -110 at real limits is totally more dressmaker than dealing -105 at penny limits. great job now you are a shrap bettor!
PikachuBets,he's in europe betting 600 e you are on some unibet bullshit where  it is  clear he doesn't have half a brain otherwise would've gotten the bo overtime ages ago
PikachuBets,tbh had to google that and found this so let me just say that i'm of mouse origin n overtime a dog and definitely n overtime interested in the iditarod
PikachuBets,lmao bro get a clue man. back when lin still g overtime solid role player minutes in lal dal offered him like $1m before he signed with cha that offseason.
PikachuBets,yes people should know better. no that does n overtime give others the green light to scam lie or otherwise tell inflated half-truths. the two are n overtime mutually exclusive.
PikachuBets,lol how about you run along now and go suck off the next fraud who goes on a h overtime streak and drop him $10 while youre at it? idiot
adamchernoff,"wow. no love for stevie nicks and a horse wanting to see the person that cared for it. cold blooded reply there. 

would you prefer chevy to bring back maddie...?"
adamchernoff,n overtime a believer in let down nor look ahead spots as there is almost always a bigger meaning behind the tighter price. a good example was smu +2.5 tonight.
adamchernoff,i liked eric decker a l overtime but we have n overtime had him since 2016. that is a good cartoon of him though i haven't seen that one before.
adamchernoff,"kansas city has the exact two weapons you want to put up points against the indianapolis defence. 

listen to my full breakdown of the game on the  podc assit (20:01):"
Ccon8181,n overtime loving the #rams 2nd half line -.5 decent middle with bears 2nd half but letting it ride. lets cash #rams -6 full game and call it a day.
Ccon8181,"slim pickings this morning. but on these two gems. solid sides. time to get right a free throw er 1-2 yesterday. 

#bills -7 -110 

#redskins -2 -110 

#bufvsmia #nyjvswas #nflpicks"
Ccon8181,"gonna get this bet out there as line is continuing to move. lets get the weekend started:

#colorado +11.5 -110 

# college football  #uscvscu # college football ootball #espn2 #skininthegame"
Ccon8181,i couldve personally but unfortunately i cant bet multiple days in advance because i can usually only get limits on day of or day before. all -6.5 yesterday. good question
Ccon8181,curry and durant have been quiet... klay going off but well take it. if #lakeshow stays with it they can get this cover. #gsw seems a little sluggish tonight. #gswvslal
Ccon8181,#wakeforest has held up on defense but needs to score on this possession! #memphis wants no part of this game. they love to fold up and quit. put em away
Ccon8181,true when the qb1 goes down that team is usually toast. but i think teams should be rewarded for having a good backup and having 2s that can step in.
Ccon8181,prime example of a lottery the operator wants nothing but this type of action. where even if you win the payout is way less than the actual odds of occurrence.
Ccon8181,if there was ever a team to hedge against its the #cavs .. up 12 at half laying 8 only -1 2nd half and struggle to put teams away. smh
Ccon8181,complete mel touchdown own and lack of effort and fight by this #hurricanes #mbb team. go prevent offense with 7 minutes le free throw  up 13. gave up at end

kellyinvegas,nah im good. you dont get to be a disgusting person and then hang out with the club. i dont play these games. youre either with me or against. period.
kellyinvegas,the public bets on saturdays and sundays. im betting on tuesdays. i dont even look at the public bets until around kick. but these bros need something to chirp about.
kellyinvegas,i made niners 7. lots of hype with seattle im n overtime buying. everyone is ready to give russell mvp. best defense hes faced. well see how it pans out.

12Xpert,would love to see the data n overtime being an xg aficionado myself. if true it would add further weight to the claim of being the greatest of all time.
12Xpert,in which case i should have long since been worm food. as i o free throw en say to the cold calling accident claims scammers you're talking to an apparition.
12Xpert,so minimum stake to clear a profit is price/yield. so suppose yield a free throw er slippage was 0.05 minimum stake to clear any profit would be 1.45/0.05 = 29.
12Xpert,glad you g overtime  years old you are shit sorted out mate. dont judge others who haven't. sometimes people cant cope with certain stuff and it doesnt matter does it.
12Xpert,thanks for letting me know. i must have forgotten to run my team name macro. ill make sure this is done when i uoload the results most likely wednesday evening.
12Xpert,"i suitable opportunity to plug my book and  it is  cha point er ""a market for lemons."" i'm guessing it might have partly been the inspiration for this betting article."
12Xpert,that is  typically n overtime something i offer. those sorts of things can be created by users from the raw data. i've always just been about offering the raw data.
12Xpert,ok i  daily fantasy sports  have cl in may sample since i  daily fantasy sports  have those results but i can do the rest. will get on to it tomorrow.
12Xpert,that is indeed the question. for the sample in the article the most likely explanation is chance (p-value = 0.12) but a longer record may change this. time will tell.
12Xpert,furthermore we  daily fantasy sports  know exactly how bookmakers respond to punters betting biases how much they try t equalise money and how much they try to exploit square money.

RufusPeabody,if i venmo michael $5 his roi is infinite which translates to a yearly roi of infinity as well. this is a much better investment than the stock market.
RufusPeabody,on 3rd and 10 this is a batter outcome for the dolphins than a punt. dont know why more teams dont take these kinds of shots on third down.
RufusPeabody,play success on third down isnt independent of 1st and 2nd down also. much more difficult to have a successful play on 3rd and 12 than 3rd and 2.
RufusPeabody,sorry i wasnt able to give out more. cant reveal my highest-edge guys since  daily fantasy sports  lineups havent locked and there are many more betting opportunities this weekend.
RufusPeabody,you're offering bets based on the best lines available but grading using rules available at two books in the world as far as i know. how is that ok?
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  know how you enforce it on a large scale. looking at previous lineups from two entries you could make a pretty good forensic argument though.
RufusPeabody,i was just saying you should find the big nascar  daily fantasy sports  guys and go h2h offsite with them like you did with preston for  college football  betting.
jeffma,bunch of peeps have asked me about my opinion on the ivey thing so i thought i'd send this out... article i wrote for  when it all came out...
jeffma,. did you really give a best bet today on  years old you are podc assit without knowing what the number was? is that what a pro bettor does?
jeffma,you are entitled to  years old you are opinion but i think worse be against the spread are when the actual play that kills you is totally irrational or

capjack2000,sounds good. i absolutely recognize you have more experience on the topic. the spend i'm hearing about in the name of customer acquisition (via all channels) is just dizzying.
capjack2000,i have n overtime looked at foxbet's pa offering but the fanduel promo is available in both nj  pa.  i assume foxbet has the same lines in both states.
capjack2000,i dont think theyre going to miss much potential action. the nba futures market has been played and wont heat up again until right before the season in mid-oct.

dinkinc,i think they play hurt for fear of losing their gig or loyalty to their teammates. i think you are thinking about to many things that are just noise
dinkinc,should the employees of a vegas sportsbook be allowed to bet out on the games their sharp bettors play them ?? could this lead to head fakes?  interesting times
dinkinc,i thought it was a complement.. pretty girl at a racetrack actually watching the race and n overtime part of a fake advertisement which i dont like at all
dinkinc,0-3 mlb tonight and to be honest i really liked these plays ... the   horses are aware how fragile my confidence can be shaken from a night like this

RASPicks,fair enough and just want to say i still appreciate and find value in  years old you are picks/thoughts on twitter so thanks for sharing them and good luck.
RASPicks,ras nfl as of 8/20/18: 11-2 +8.8 units 7 plays pending (lines really flew today but lines very attainable with new release model) 10 plays still to be released.
ProfessorShine,josh should be forced to bet his bullshit at a real book (or account) for real cash.  a free throw er a year he would go away very broke.
ProfessorShine,i spent time on his website a few years ago and tracked his games.  ive heard his yearbook is full of data. so good for his fans i guess
suuma810,dazu kommt dass murray unter kliff bei neutralem gamescri point  sicherlich me ho you are psse und o point ions bekommt ergo me ho you are volumen als haskins.
suuma810,klar keine frage. aber er ist ein limitierter qb und nach sieben jahren sehe ich da nicht das groe potenzial nach oben. es muss fr ihn halt alles stimmen.
suuma810,sure do salaries rise his contract is still massive. his average salary ranks 3rd behind rodgers and ryan his cap hit will be 3rd in 2019 as of now.
ClevTA,well if the reports say it then that settles it. must be true. n overtime like hed ever use the media to change perce point ion. piece of cake
ClevTA,i was talking about seeding purposes. i was still holding out hope for the 1 seed. if they had won by 20+ i thing they wouldve stayed at 1
ClevTA,well then that settles it. would it be wrong to score a  touchdown  at the end and go for 2 and the win? would u be upset with that?
ClevTA,what are u taking about??? i post all my records on the site. i pick  thursday night football  gms and then i post all my picks for the weekend
ClevTA,i always chuckle when another college basketball season starts and i learn that an ex star's son is a big recruit. greg anthony's kid is a star unc freshman?
ClevTA,dude calm down. i thought my friend here tweeted something so i did a search and saw  years old you are tweet instead. relax im n overtime rehashing this
ClevTA,n overtime sure those teams will take the chance. guys like jones and gruden have proven they dont care about off the field so those were just my guesses
ClevTA,what kind of response is this? im starting a fact and points to the rest of their schedule n overtime being difficult with actual data. how miserable are u
ClevTA,hilliard can spell chubb on a couple series and can handle the 3rd downs and is a pretty decent receiver. th against the spread all u really need tbh
CizzlingSports,"hi brit fyi deadspin is n overtime a subsidiary.  it is  an asset. and it also isn't owned by gawker anymore - hasn't been for some time.

carry on."
CizzlingSports,provided they had another $3480 handy to keep betting with on 9/21/19 (assuming all bets at -110) a free throw er already sinking $17697.00 into the package tho right?
CizzlingSports,seems like a good day to remind everyone that # worst of all time   told all of us that pg was of course never going to resign with okc
spanky,i've given you credit ed. i've retweeted  years old you are releases.  i've acknowledged you being the rare exce point ion. what more do you want me to do?
spanky,th against the spread only when youre in probation. i never was on probation. if this were the case id probably lose 80 percent  of my gambling friends lol.
spanky,if anyone ever wanted to do a documentary on non-tout pros i dont think many pros would volunteer to be on.  there is little to no upside.  $  glory
spanky,its been 5 days and im happy to report  hasnt kicked me out or reduced my limits! thank you  for being a real bookmaker who acce points  all customers!
DocBettor,yes to the first two questions but if you came just for picks youre in the wrong place find a tout with a narrative to make a strong case
PlusEVAnalytics,th against the spread total crap and you know it. obviously roi as a measure of skill has the same sample size considerations as any other measure of anything.
PlusEVAnalytics,todays weird stuff promoted into my tl. hey lets take content th against the spread relevant only to golf course superintendents and bl assit it out to random people?
PlusEVAnalytics,true but th against the spread extremely difficult to do - th against the spread exactly why i try to stay on the side that benefits from it :)
PlusEVAnalytics,agreed. kelly  percent  is just the vehicle that i used to present the bayesian posterior for the market regression parameter. there are other presentations that would work equally well.
PlusEVAnalytics,regression before or a free throw er is a semantic point ill give it to you and im over it. im talking about the whole point of this discussion.
PlusEVAnalytics,congratulations to  on getting his paper on developing a solvency framework for bookmakers published in this months issue of the actuarial research journal variance. one small step for man...
PlusEVAnalytics,another difference is that the specialized skill of base running is n overtime given the same level of prominence (rightly or wrongly) as the specialized skill of place kicking.
aluckyaday,ladbrokes now part of gvc i believe is the oldest 1900s i think. coral also part of gvc have been around since the 1920s william hill since the 1930s.
aluckyaday,forg overtime to update. 1-3. season now 27-22-3 (started week 2)  55.1 percent . infinite tipping monkeys would have this record or better 24.4 percent  of the time. regressing
aluckyaday,yes it is open to abuse if they are regularly taking them and only voiding when winning. it that can be proven then the regulator (facilitator haha) should act.
aluckyaday,you would think they would be all over pushing online casinos type games. are online slots table games and bingo allowed in the us? is it a seperate licence?
aluckyaday,would be interesting to here what  thinks of  years old you are big 6 methodology. data mining which should regress? or deliberate bookmaker inefficiencies where square money outweighs sharp?

theFirmAISports,great insights. o you are model has oregon as a strong play too. they are a high variance team but they are 100 percent  capable of winning this weekend
joeytunes2,are we done with winston? this guy sucks. they would win more games n overtime passing. he really is the  fault of all losses. again i bet this moron.
joeytunes2,tbh i swear i was gonna say. also  theres value according to model. i would never bet something like that. ty for calling me out haha. i deserved that.
joeytunes2,oregon looks scary good defensively. stopping the run. daring the terrible pass attack of auburn. gonna be a long year for auburn. as i hold many season win unders.
joeytunes2,lol. n overtime gonna lie i wanna smack you around. but all good i get  years old you are a troll account. all good brother. keep the accounts coming
joeytunes2,man there so many shows on tv/netflix. now that i have time.just g overtime caught up with episode 1 of married with children. dm to discuss very funny show.
joeyisaks,how much of it is improving bullpens / getting to the middle of the pen in 6th isnt a huge advantage anymore so less incentive to work a count?
joeyisaks,its actually an interesting conce point  that economically if implemented correctly would fix a l overtime of things  read about it and educate yourself before jumping to a conclusion
joeyisaks,other nomination for time magazine man of year is the automated 2 cent line moves any time placing a limit bet at low limits like egy point ian soccer
joeyisaks,isnt that how every sport translates to new talent every 10-15 years? coulda said same thing with sampras / agassi when they were at the top 20 years ago
joeyisaks,big win? come on d.... he risked 2.3k to win 3.2k on a negative expected value bet ... how much did this sportsbook pay you to tweet this dareen?
EdMillerPoker,"producing a engaging firehose of content about gambling is v hard and im rarely critical of the folks who try.

but this article really rubbed me the wrong way."
EdMillerPoker,this is one of my favorite twitter nuggets now. promise to shamelessly abuse this insight at some point and will send you le free throw -handed beer as compensation.
EdMillerPoker,im no sl overtime expert at all but like ge is a simple well-designed and popular game and im sure performs well precisely due to its key game mechanic.
EdMillerPoker,yeah its bad. they should acce point  in-play bets without delay at posted limits without exce point ion and if they cant do that they shouldnt offer the market.
EdMillerPoker,theres enough ways for smart ppl with vision to force their way in thru cracks that i think its fairly likely one of them will really build a monster
nonrandomalpha,weep with us as we breakdown o you are whiff at $150000 in the  million contest; we also recap week 4 performance and look ahead to week 5 spreads...
LeeSharpeNFL,as you note they are heavily favored against min. if they win they are also favorites in gb despite it being in gb and gb cooking off the bye.
LeeSharpeNFL,i am off work until january 2! and since i  daily fantasy sports  really watch/follow college football this leaves me plenty of time to dig into nfl numbers. :)
LeeSharpeNFL,good. i love sports betting but if you're a player coach official or otherwise an employee of a team or league you have no business whatsoever engaging in it.
whale_capper,of course if they could go back in time and get 2015 cam you play him over allen in a heartbeat but i fear that player is long gone
whale_capper,th against the spread outrageous... home team with an implied win of 7 percent  in week 2 of the nfl is n overtime something i ever thought id see
whale_capper,the summary of this article and what i've seen in general in the nfl is the number itself is super freaking important... unlike the nba for the most part
whale_capper,when im out of my de point h on a topic for sure the content suffers and th against the spread pretty clear when i try to talk golf
whale_capper,predicated on no kd until g5 likely n overtime at all... i might be off on that though no clue wh against the spread going on for real there

JoeyKnish22,curtis was a huge part of getting this done. his brother kevin also great politician good guy. i know the family a bit. happy for him happy for us.
JoeyKnish22,i cant give out all the good stuff roof. maybe we start exchanging golf for volleyball in the dms. ill have my people contact  years old you are people.
JoeyKnish22,if lsu wins out and isnt the 1 seed. i dont want to overreact. but i want the committee members who voted for osu #1 imprisoned in guantanamo bay.
JoeyKnish22,well gar th against the spread why they call you the garfather and me the godfather. the utes are in if they win out baby. put it in stone.
JoeyKnish22,myles garrett swung a helmet at another player during a game and theres video of it so it will receive 100x more public scorn and attention than this will.
JoeyKnish22,"account has to be clean (n overtime limited) and verified (all verification info submitted for withdrawals). 

as many know they havent taken new accounts for years (hence the request)."
JoeyKnish22,and tell those yosef trolls rolling around appy state can suck my dick theyre bout to get bent over by the cocks this weekend like its a  house pay
JoeyKnish22,l assit couple weeks russo has also been absolutely horrific throwing the ball so i see why theyd give the kid a sh overtime and be more run focused.
JoeyKnish22,nah if he stays healthy he should win it but all it takes is 1-2 games missed to throw you off pace. n overtime worth it imo at +100.
JoeyKnish22,the cap in the nfl is 3 percent . typical range on contracts is 1.5-3 percent . but theres only like 5-6 agencies that represent majority of the league.
JoeyKnish22,some people have said the real deal version is raichubets and he would own the weaker pikachubets. n overtime saying i feel this way. but people are saying it.
JoeyKnish22,feels weird to n overtime have enough money on it this year to make me on the verge of a reversal of fortune. real shame. might actually enjoy it.
TheKostos,doesnt bother me the way it used to. i feel bad for the season ticket holders who have to pay an arm and a leg to support these slapdicks
TheKostos,if you stacked fitz/gesicki in a lineup and then took them both out when the mixon news broke to work things around congr against the spread you're nick kostos
TheKostos,"the giants win tonight by losing. any giants fan rooting for a ""nostalgic eli moment"" is an asshole.

lose out. dra free throw  chase young.

that is a win."
TheKostos,trubisky and flacco both have the same injury. its called a coach doesnt want to play him anymore sprain. ive heard its quite painful  for what  it is  worth
TheKostos,"almost time for people to reveal their biggest week 10 nfl pieces of shit. get ready! 

(i am actually pretty happy today  especially if the steelers and packers cover)"
TheKostos,i was thinking this morning that it might take something like that to wake people up. i'm n overtime trying to be an alarmist just rational about what's happening
TheKostos,"that was his first promo back too. think about how amazing he's gonna be as he gets his feet back under him.

i *need* ""trust me"" to return. need."
TheKostos,"schala theme underrated choice. gets overshadowed by corridors of time but  it is  very very good

(yes i own the ct soundtrack in addition to several other jrpg soundtracks)"
TheKostos,"would people be interested in election betting coverage on

just analysis of the market and if there are smart bets to be made...."
LockyLockerson,really tough because usc has been all over the map for me all year tough for me to make a number on them sometimes but i had oregon -6
LockyLockerson,plus you know that it means we're getting closer and closer to me n overtime cluttering  years old you are timeline with nfl preseason experiments that torch fake moneyz
LockyLockerson,i was very surprised with how insignificant a schedule is compared to so many other things but the extent to which we all focus a l overtime on it
LockyLockerson,purdue down from 8 to 7.5 with an avalanche of tiny ass bets.   daily fantasy sports  worry still at le assit a half-win more of value there maybe more.
LockyLockerson,normally id say this is a bad idea because golden state will be worse next year but if harden and paul really are sick of each other makes sense.
LockyLockerson,so now the warriors and rockets have to play again next year to see if we can go the distance without a major injury to see who is better
EliHershkovich,knew i should've bet msu. winston so good in bounce-back spots  sparty's d has shut down edwards. says a l overtime about what to expect in va. tech-dayton too.
EliHershkovich,"n overtime necessarily karma. just n overtime running into those breaks. most of pats' ""forced turnovers"" over the p assit couple weeks have been anything but i.e. muffed punt."
EliHershkovich,"cleveland was +900 to win the al central on july 3 (seven-game deficit).

if the indians hold onto their 6-2 lead in minnesota tonight they'll be tied for first."
EliHershkovich,agreed. scherzer is the clear-cut best pitcher in the game plus strasburg and corbin undergoing positive regression. just need a little bullpen help to pair with a surging lineup.
EliHershkovich,three of the ra point ors' top players tonight went to: san diego state (kawhi) new mexico state (siakam) and wichita state (vanvleet). mid-major fever still exists in june.
DannyParkins,too deep for piniero with the injury. no sense in punting.  years old you are defense is strong enough to hold them if you dont get it. easy decision.
DannyParkins,alright its about that time for #youcallit submissions. questions or topics you want me to address in o you are rapid fire segment on the national show tonight. go!
DannyParkins,damn th against the spread impressive patience by rodney hood to n overtime just fire up the 3 as soon as he g overtime it. great call by doris.
DannyParkins,eloy will learn to take charge on that ball and andersons having an inauspicious start to his season defensively. that was ugly baseball and kc immediately makes em pay.

Gingfacekillah,i cann overtime count the number of times i've revisited something a second or third time and found something new: a book an idea a strategy/method a former edge.
Gingfacekillah,thanks for this. i've been through benter's paper and used logistic regression successfully to the end you've described. just exploring how something similar might be done with bayes theorem.
Gingfacekillah,is averaging the 3 best true odds method results together a horrible idea? if so which method would be  years old you are preference? im leaning towards the logarithmic.
Gingfacekillah,from  years old you are perspective does a house liability side arise naturally through betting action or is it an active process where the house is taking a position?
logan_matthews9,i think a fair approach is keeping the knish name as long as hes in the lead. i have faith in you to restore  years old you are place
logan_matthews9,because you arent worth my time - much like a 47k person contest that pays a $2 grand prize isnt worth anyone who knows what they are doings time.
logan_matthews9,even the best modelers in the world will still struggle to deliver value as touts...... but people who think they have an edge in every nfl game arent that
logan_matthews9,brooks isnt a comparison at all. the obvious basis is giancarlo gonzlez- 26 year old coming off a great mls season and solid summer showing. he went for $5m
logan_matthews9,the gold cup odds seem... off to me. you can get mexico +140 and the us +150... no one other than those two have won a traditional gold cup.
logan_matthews9,but would love to connect more - seems like  years old you are approach is quite different from mine and i imagine theres some value in comparing the two

ToddFuhrman,the sign of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results. its mind boggling the cardinals continue to trust carlos martinez in high leverage situations
ToddFuhrman,they do always struggle and the level of familiarity with the coaching staff also should mean a vanilla offense from ne but this dolphins team is devoid of talent
ToddFuhrman,and i commented on that extensively in the p assit the same way i attacked baylor check my timeline.  n overtime sure you connecting the two is remotely close
ToddFuhrman,nah n overtime a rookie move if you had reason to believe kj costello would play this weeekend but with him getting ruled out number slid back to opener

TheCousinSal,i bet a free throw er that embarrassing play carlos wants to hyde under a pylon.  (sorry - the extra ho you are of sleep is killing me) #nfluk
TheCousinSal,good lord dolphins. josh rosen is currently trying to figure out an injury involving a gatorade cooler so that he doesnt have to be a part of this mess.
TheCousinSal,so..3rd and 10 is a sideline screen to cooper that gets bottled up immediately and 3rd and 2 is a downfield throw 10 yards out of bounds? makes sense.
TheCousinSal,its barely 10:45 on the west co assit and the p against the spread have been called for an offensive holding a false start and a pick play. #somethingaintright

TheCousinSal,the degenerate trifecta + i are recording #againstallodds podc assits at the  in fort worth this saturday. special guests include     and many more who unfortunately aren't quite as special.
TheCousinSal,you can say nova (best #1 seed) g overtime screwed having to play one of the greatest #8 seeds ever. so  let us  go ahead and say it.  #marchmadness
TheCousinSal,my week 11 recap on  + a chance 2 win a trip 2 vegas if  years old you are fantasy lineup be against the spread mine. hint: it won't
12Xpert,could you just clear up what the yellow line actually is. is it expected profit based on  years old you are odds divided by closing odds with margin removed?
12Xpert,if it a large number which i guess is the case then that would imply that there is marginal efficiency superiority of pinny over the sharps they are using.
12Xpert,"that old chestnut again so you have a h overtime line to ""moral truth"" now do you? did you complain in 2007 about this? or was it right then?"
12Xpert,i'll knock it. when you breach financial fair play and commit doping violations and uefa couldn't care less because  it is  better for their wallet then anything is possible.

RufusPeabody,this is n overtime how good the teams are;  it is  what o you are model of the  college football  playoff committee projects the rankings would be now.
RufusPeabody,i mean if you really want to talk about documented picks you can search through the  archives or see the summary of 8 seasons of public picks here.
RufusPeabody,best  podcast to help pr expected points added re me for a fantasy football dra free throw  tonight that i am woefully underpr expected points added red for?
RufusPeabody,true. but  says his subscribers want to know where the best number is. easy solution: grade against widely available number but point out who has the best number.
RufusPeabody,th against the spread a big part of it. easy to under or overshrink depending on what youre betting into vs what you used to calibrate the shrinkage
RufusPeabody,this is how i can lose while hitting woodland for 6 figures. large diverse portfolio. i also made money on the masters despite losing 6 figures fading molinari.
RufusPeabody,i'll put it this way. i  daily fantasy sports  think anyone is fundamentally worse than +110 betting against a true market number  that is  -110 on each side.
RufusPeabody,...but we have no way of knowing who they are ahead of time. if you fade bettors who have done exce point ionally poorly you will still lose.
jeffma,im n overtime sure why so many college teams walk the ball up the court. getting a 10 second violation with zero pressure on you is completely ridiculous
jeffma,feel free to listen to the pod. none of it is personal at all. just discusses the work you have done and  years old you are pick selling
jeffma,legitimately sitting next to my buddy who just told me he started matt schaub today... he claims he did n overtime know he was no longer a starter
SportsCheetah,the rims are so free throw  as hell fairly certain overs were a thing early on but i havent followed a free throw er the market caught up.
SportsCheetah,i believe he was referencing the ball handlers  field goal  percent  in pnr plays. luka is no. 1 in ppp per pnr on a team level as well.
SportsCheetah,i  daily fantasy sports  think the nfc e assit is actually as bad as it appears (despite their records). seattle has played a tougher schedule though for sure.

capjack2000,conveniently days a free throw er the super bowl. if it is another patriots victory rhode island might be begging for enough runway to get back to even.
capjack2000,"looks like  has 23 props on tonights  monday night football  game!

capjack2000,yep fully admit i botched that part of the tweet. in my defense that entire tweet thread was done while lying in bed with only one eye open.

capjack2000,"they le free throw  out the biggest difference between american and european bookmaking efforts. the risk management. 

also glaring error in the story about who kambi partners with."
capjack2000,since it won't be recorded and  it is  an intimate space yes i'll come pr expected points added red with some nuggets for those lucky enough to attend.
capjack2000,borgatasports. its the same so free throw ware as playmgm different skin. different account from playmgm but i cant promise it will effectively double the limits. same management.

dinkinc,looks like i will get to meet  's coolest monthly donor as  is flying into the states from austrailia ... we might actually meet in two different cities

robpizzola,could tell that milos could barely move in the final few games. oh well. now get to watch my fellow paesano fognini lay waste to this american dude.
robpizzola,would you acce point  a tout that only markets long-term records (multiple seasons) and has a full database of every pick recorded against pinny or cris full limits?
RASPicks,no reason and agree. we've been asked this a few times since a free throw er l assit season. might make that change for 2018  college football .
VegasRefund,its a legit tragedy they ended the great alaskan shootout. betting on the anchorage seawolves the day before thanksgiving every year was one of the better betting traditions.

suuma810,there are some anomalies in life. one is the #packers being 5-15 su  5-15 against the spread  in road games with aaron rodgers since week 16 in 2015.
suuma810,"combining this information the #dolphins 2020 dra free throw  capital should look like this right now:

1st
2nd
3rd 3rd
4th 4th
5th 5th

7th 7th"
suuma810,run defense shouldnt be a big reason in 2019 though. he just needs to do what he can do best and th against the spread rushing the passer.
suuma810,#chiefs should do this. come playoffs they could feature a secondary with eric berry kendall fuller  patrick peterson. justin houston  a rising dee ford on the edges. scary.
suuma810,"the #seahawks  went 75 percent  run on first down yesterday (18 runs for 39 yards) and had a 100-yard rusher (carson 102). they won 24-13.

trust the process."
suuma810,it is  just his third nfl start and we were expecting a high variance passer - high ad overtime some deep bombs but also more interce point ions.
ClevTA,incorrect. hubbard has $10m of dead money alone if u cut him and u arent accounting for all the big extensions coming up with baker chubb garrett etc
ClevTA,so dallas was just -3 in chicago so philly and bears are a pk on neutral? i make this philly -1.5 but th against the spread just me
ClevTA,so u just ignored the part about going back to june of 18 and loss of velocity? he wasnt terrible but close to 4.0 era during that stretch
ClevTA,doesnt have to be an advanced stat although many of those have cinci as they worst or 2nd worst pass d. yards per carry is one basic way
ClevTA,surely lebron struggling in utah was never factored into the line. th against the spread the deep dive analysis that finds the inefficiencies i like out of u!
ClevTA,this is going to be a big test on  years old you are theory that there is n overtime such thing as look ahead and let down games
ClevTA,like the l assit 5 tweets and ig posts from brendan are about this bachelor thing. hes really laying it out there for the world to know haha
ClevTA,there are much worse backup corners u could have other than mitchell and carrie. its wh against the spread behind those guys th against the spread the issue

spanky,depends on the bookmakers tolerance. also depends if the account has prior history of being a losing account. weve had accounts l assit anywhere from minutes to months.
spanky,comparing the super liquid and efficient equities market to the illliquid inefficient sports market is unfair.  we can agree to disagree. its all good i appreciate the debate
spanky,n overtime in the le assit for me.  if it was 10k college football i would be horny. if it was 10k college basketball i would jerk off.
spanky,exactly. then you have the guy th against the spread a table player who gets 20k on the game bet the other side.  its so easy its pathetic.

PlusEVAnalytics,yes compare the 17 percent  take to a -110 market. theyre both the magnitude by which you have to be a better than average handicapper to become +ev.
PlusEVAnalytics,tell me again why black box models are so great...lol. twitter thinks andy is a dog lover because his followers post about dogs all the time i.e. underdogs.
PlusEVAnalytics,wishnowsky 27 is a native of perth australia. he earned the nickname boo minutes onion a free throw er a preseason tackle and he has two this season.
PlusEVAnalytics,this is doubling down on 11 getting a 5 and waiting to be put out of my misery. at le assit pat shurm you are is the dealer.

aluckyaday,what makes you think companies have been in the bookmaking business since before vegas even had a railroad are only in the us market to pump and dump?
aluckyaday,true. i would think for a l overtime of people they would n overtime understand the variance and over bet them. they are spanyk's plays. i can't lose
aluckyaday,i guess the big issue with it being free is you have no comeback when it is shit which is what usually happens to things run by governments!
aluckyaday,a blanket ban does seem to highlight a lack of understanding of the bet as does highlighting someone who g overtime lucky as a reason for dropping it!
aluckyaday,yep. but they lose more doing luckies because of the compounding effect of the bias. i would think permed luckies are a big red flag for any account!
aluckyaday,have you tried looking at what happens if you use closing prices? it should be more + expected value at close as we can classify qualifiers more accuratly?

joeytunes2,hahah no sir. i liked vegas better. when i lived. no argument there guyyyyyy. vegas will never go away. we just grew up on this out here haha

joeyisaks,if you look at the  college football  lines fly today its ras hitting them when jambo gets that kind of respect from the market then you can talk
joeyisaks,im n overtime sure which part of the tweet is more mind boggling the betting logic aspect of it or tht he tries to tie in human trafficking
joeyisaks,hes also a first year starter but i do agree he wont be a good pro but he will be a close to perfect college player next year
joeyisaks,or uber. but it also is likely the l assit home game unless eagles win which i dont see happening. will save $ for dodgers world series 2019
joeyisaks,bohemian rhapsody was 20-1 to win tonight. star is born -1000 in this category  lady gaga -250 and bradley cooper -500. all lost. oscars just g overtime interesting?
EdMillerPoker,my experience was when someone tried to enter 888 lineups it ended up being a glorified train and the l assit few hundred lineups were almost certainly -ev.
EdMillerPoker,"on one hand i have every sym point om here described and apparently it has a name.

on the other hand my couch desperately needs to be vacuumed."
EdMillerPoker,it is  us-focused for sure. there's no specific handicapping info in the book though  it is  more about how markets work and how to look at things logically.
EdMillerPoker,are there any standards of speed and accuracy required in the bill for the official in-play data? or are sportsbooks required to buy it no matter the quality?
EdMillerPoker,"the core vegan argument is that  it is  n overtime ok to eat meat obv you disagree but gtfo with this ""surely we can agree to disagree"" shit"

GolcondaFund,"n overtime a h overtime take
dolphins are the best worst team i have ever seen in the nfl.

LeeSharpeNFL,also the differential is likely higher on  thursday night football  games. data has shown the better team wins a higher  percent  of the time off the short week.
whale_capper,tough call if they win it will go up to -110ish which is still value if they lose which the market expects it could drop to like +240ish
whale_capper,completely see that... greater uncertainty though expecting a team to win a championship on the fly like this chemistry takes time (or at le assit it always has)
AndyMSFW,g overtime so busy chasing oklahoma tt over with oklahoma 2h tt over that i forg overtime about basketball for tomorrow!  well this is what i just bet.

JoeyKnish22,lol i have a normal size play on +3 (-115) from when it first popped. no strong opinion. would look live as opposed to playing it rn pregame

Gingfacekillah,one of the better sites i've found for tracking live covid19 updates in the us and canada. graphs cases segmented by state/province and news references for each case.
Gingfacekillah,that is  a good looking test! i  wouldn't assume  moneyline results necessarily extend to against the spread  results though - i would test s expected points added rately.
Gingfacekillah,traditional possession formula reliably overestimates # of possessions for almost all teams. something along the lines of -2.23+(1.07* field goal a)+(0.37* free throw a)+(-1.23*orb)+(0.87*tov) appears a bit better.
Gingfacekillah,i wait for this article to come out every year. it never disappoints. find  years old you are team's article and get ready for some h overtime takes.
Gingfacekillah,for all my epl friends today watford looks really good. line's been converging on my model nicely. i'd look to see watford take this match 2-1 or 2-0.

Ccon8181,unreal bullshit on #steelers +2.5 on to the next. #nevspit gotta take the l and move on. a loss like that would put a novice bettor on tilt
Ccon8181,#browns gonna get the with this week. made the cut but i cant keep throwing money down that hole. so of course they cover this week. f em
Ccon8181,"contrarian investments llc is invested in: 

#steelers -6 -115 

pissed i waited and took a shitty line. lets see how tomlin f it up. # sunday night football"
Ccon8181,there going learn soon enough. n overtime going to talk about it just hammer them. get back to moving the whole lv market when i touch a side.
Ccon8181,flash forward to se point ember when every tout comes out of the woodwork to rep outrageous win  percent 's.. how many are still here from sep 2015.
Ccon8181,really like the #zags but was n overtime the side. stuck with the system n #cuse g overtime there... unfortunately #hoosiers are done. 2-1 day. on to next
kellyinvegas,i mean i didnt go out because my body needed a detox from the other 5 days i went out this weekend plus tomm plus all this weekend
kellyinvegas,sorry. i shouldve elaborated. because i bet early in the week and throughout the week. those betting sunday morning will very rarely get the best of the number.
ToddFuhrman,"imagine explaining to new  college football  fans that sec games were traditionally played first team to 17 rather than the 2019 version of the league

(sorry uga fans)"
ToddFuhrman,thanks craig always love talking football with the guys segment flies by and never a chance to really deep dive a l overtime of the stuff we discuss
ToddFuhrman,brennan my friend 9-6 y touchdown  does the trick... college football  has been very good thus far and sometimes the best bets are the hardest ones to make.
ToddFuhrman,would rather see lifetime healthcare or pension for athletes than these kids taking 3k in endorsements believing th against the spread more valuable than anything else out there
ToddFuhrman,and i have no problem with people feeling this way but listening to people talk about the core ra point ors fan base of 20+ years is insufferable
ToddFuhrman,honestly he'd be a better fit; give them that edge and toughness holding younger players accountable but when it comes to the fighting dolans who the hell knows
ToddFuhrman,figured theyd come out faster but found that gear to start 2nd half. take the split on hoops and with on pucks. heres to rooting for this man
ToddFuhrman,my favorite time of year is when people that  daily fantasy sports  watch  college basketball  all year feign outrage about mediocre teams n overtime making the field #selectionsunday
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to the current gambling gambling gold rush of content we're currently living in (across all platforms tv radio digital etc) what's most important to you?
ToddFuhrman,that is  the amount of money the casino theoretically keeps on each bet; the lower the hold  percent  on a given market the more advantageous for the player
TheCousinSal,i hate to get political and point out when we were collectively wrong as a nation - but its time to face facts...we completely overrated the afc north.
TheCousinSal,one of my very favorite things is when a person being interviewed says something like are you kidding me man? to a female reporter. #nbadra free throw 2019
TheCousinSal,im hearing from people in the tv industry that jeopardy james lost. this would be big news if true. hang tight - ill try to get confirmation soon.
TheCousinSal,wow - if you were dropped on earth this am and listened to all the nfl pundits - you would think the rams were favored by 7+ points.
TheCousinSal,can we agree that this will be the worst bad beat of all-time 73 ots from now when this atrocity of a bowl game goes over the total?
12Xpert,"you may also say there is intuition or as you put it ""gut feeling."" you still need to test it. if it stops working you won't know why."
12Xpert,"""[t]here is no corresponding short gambling benefits screen to explore whether people have ever experienced mental stimulation from gambling whether they have had fun with friends while gambling..."""
12Xpert,you have a truth ruler matthew. impressive. what are the units on it? facts? can you also predict the future too?  ill follow  years old you are tips
12Xpert,this might be useful in this context. how closing line value is so much faster than profits/losses at revealing potential skill (of course it assumes clvh is true).
12Xpert,"and you think the only people who use my data are tipsters?

and without so free throw book data i'd have no idea how pinnacle compares to them."
12Xpert,if there is a figure less than infinity that you would n overtime want to lose over liverpool winning the league then you're n overtime a proper fan.
JambosPicks,picks are in! sign up for a 1-week 4-week or 17-week package at  today to get o you are plays and be eligible for o you are guarantee!
mschwimer,i know it sounds crazy. but that is basically the exact deal i offered  they declined. smart on their part. its obvious they did their research on us.
mschwimer,just like cal ripken. wont leave until every autograph is signed/question answered. i preach full transparacy and accountability. plus im learning a lot!  particularly has been extremely helpful.
mschwimer,this is exactly what we are looking at. exce point  o you are average edge is way more than 4 percent . 4 percent  is just the minimum.
mschwimer,g overtime a car music system (cuz my cd player broke) i g overtime the cheapest possible because bass doesnt matter when you listen to bruce all day.
RufusPeabody,i'm trying to use what little influence i have to help people realize that almost all pick-sellers are providing nothing of value and many are outright scammers.
RufusPeabody,i would argue the opposite. a favorite should be less slightly less willing to go for two early since their chances of winning in  overtime are greater.
RufusPeabody,marcus mariota qb risk taking  college football  futures narratives overreactions and the world's deadliest animals all discussed on this week's  plus i sing the army fight song!
RufusPeabody,nate lashley xander schauffele and hideki matsuyama each won in exactly 1 of the 40000 simulations i ran. wolff na and harding won in 4 of them.
RufusPeabody,if you have a good long-term record hell yes you are showing it. you are designing  years old you are whole site around making it super visible.
RufusPeabody,you're making the argument conditional on knowing the first 2-point try fails. if you knew it was going to fail obviously you would never go for it.
jeffma,too many choices... italian - 7 hills sushi - akiko gourmet chinese - mr. jius greek - kokkari high end seafood - angler sf pizza - tonys
jeffma,yeah. weve always wanted to do a more focused segment approach but we o free throw en end up rambling. feel free to dm me anymore feedback
SportsCheetah,sure but th against the spread the case every year. cant disregard the results of the season or you might as well run the playoff in august.
SportsCheetah,up to you really can go cheaper +$ route or try to middle it taking the points. can do some of both. you have o point ions.
SportsCheetah,eh closed 217 ill take 219.5 there every time. hard to win too many unders when seth curry drops 23 off of the bench in a half.
SportsCheetah,you have room to hedge as much or as little as youd like really just up to you and how much profit youd like to lock up.
SportsCheetah,nice yeah if its a big score id lock up some profit now either way. im n overtime too confident betting either side in that game anyway.
SportsCheetah,time will tell but i need to find a new hobby on these late saturday nights into sunday mornings when i  daily fantasy sports  get to sleep
SportsCheetah,this was the hope before the betting markets react accordingly to the news. duffey is brutal. rice transfer as the other o point ion n overtime great.
capjack2000,"a l overtime of people have asked me recently for a sportsbetting resolution. 

i  daily fantasy sports  think it really matters all that much but here's mine:"
capjack2000,"theres a l overtime in the  investor presentation that makes you go  

 is  years old you are source for stepping through it all with a keen perspective."
capjack2000,looks like betmgm updated their tc and by the looks of it they suspect some insider trading is being done and want to insulate themselves from it.
capjack2000,many nj books allow selling of points you likely  daily fantasy sports  get full value for the point just like you likely overpay when you buy points.
capjack2000,"dear sportradar:

the term in hockey is penalty. n overtime suspension.

this is showing up in all the ""official"" live data feeds for in-game betting in nj."
capjack2000,"depends on the state. n overtime many states have online casinos. nj pa de. 

there is a decided culture gap between american and european models there too."
capjack2000,only if someone runs in tonight and paints new house rules on the wall that say nfl football must be played on a 100yd field. right  ?
capjack2000,"people wonder why i'm so opposed to kambi's business model of wanting purely recreational bettors with no sharp action. the answer in two words:

glass ceiling.

1/3"
capjack2000,no clarity as of yet. i was asking her to affirm or deny that the dge is the hurdle. no reply a free throw er 10 days.
capjack2000,fanduel operates betfair casino (online casinos became legal in nj in 2013). as for wh...they dont and im n overtime sure why not. seems ideal for diversification.
capjack2000,"in all the hoopla surrounding  
sports betting independence day
i completely forg overtime nj is releasing the april numbers today...here's my quick snap guess on handle:
$295m"
capjack2000,"does this mean no in-game betting for ncaa in tn? 

so far ncaa has n overtime made available any realtime official data for any of their sports."
capjack2000,just curious what  years old you are source is for opening/closing lines? n overtime all opening lines are made at the same time...but closing lines typically are.
capjack2000,to be clear the placement of that sentence is in regards to proxy or messenger wagering. however we've seen it in other states where context doesn't matter.
dinkinc,i knew i might have an issue when   announced the yankee game as an over in the bottom of the fi free throw h.  horrible gambling etiquette
dinkinc,1-1 mlb with a push............  2-2 horse  props ..... 0-1 nhl..... we are on the precipice of a slump... horses want a bail [of hay} out tomorrow
dinkinc,the first check i use to see if someone is a good human being is if they follow   .... i haven't figured out the second check yet
robpizzola,maybe in the first half of the season mostly because allen was getting the starts for them. they were definitely n overtime garbage in the new year.
robpizzola,largely built up before he had a devastating knee injury... once again outlines the issues with using trends in handicapping because they never paint the full picture.
robpizzola,i hope si is paying for all the cocaine  that is  needed to film these. christ n overtime a single breath in that fo you are minutes.
robpizzola,im n overtime saying o-line isnt a problem because it definitely is. but the decline in his play even with time in the pocket has been considerable.
robpizzola,ravens receivers are running wide open everywhere but lamars throws have absolutely been on point. all three  touchdown s hit his wide receivers perfectly in stride. impressive.
robpizzola,look for the clip of him refusing to give us an interview even though you promised to donate $500 to the rivers of hope foundation live on-air.
robpizzola,what's the sample on the other bets? there's always going to be massive variance with the outrights (part of the reason i  daily fantasy sports  love outrights).
robpizzola,i feel bad for you but fucking get better is such a great line. im going to have to start using that in my regular day-to-day activities.
robpizzola,cohen i will honestly say that the thing i miss most about hsr if you always laughing at my terrible jokes. it was great for my self-esteem.
robpizzola,if you didnt bet on every 12 seed the second that i made a tweet about rooting against 12 seeds i dont know what to tell you.
RASPicks,certainly wnba lines are n overtime as efficient as the big three pro sports.  but the difference is a l overtime smaller than it used to be.
RASPicks,if in theory someone had a proven winning system they're n overtime sharing it publicly. and if they did it wouldn't last. so the answer is 'no.'
RASPicks,fo you are easy covers fo you are heartbreaking close losses and the worst timing of a release ever.  march has been an adventure.  we'll keep trying.
RASPicks,ras guarantee:  if you can't get the release lines or if service is just n overtime working for you get a refund for unused portion at anytime.
RASPicks,btw if you didn't get -2 on the wbb play yesterday you are n overtime going to be f assit enough to get release lines on service.
RASPicks,totals market is a mystery i think we will get them earlier than l assit year but even l assit year we did great through early january.
VegasRefund,"who are  years old you are bottom 5 startings qbs in the nfl right now?

*rookies dont count
*minimum 3 starts this year and havent been benched."
VegasRefund,maction starts next week. which means today is the l assit day we will n overtime have any football for a long time. thank you football gods.
VegasRefund,. is averaging about 100 followers every 30 seconds right now. also wonder how much it cost him to get his straight up name as a handle.
VegasRefund,the amount of exposure dr. pepper gets by putting someone out there that will embarrass themselves is n overtime comparable. jose is trending the winner is not.
ProfessorShine,there is a difference between an angle  a trend.  an angle could be a signal but as soon as its public it will soon lose its value
ProfessorShine,a good one. i always remind people that duva did mel a disservice by putting him in with terry norris 2 years later over a chavez rematch.
ProfessorShine,opposite sides is an 80s scam before cell phones or social media. the multiple package scam still exits and does well.  pimp whatever package is doing best.

suuma810,"incase you missed it : my detroit #lions 2019 team preview!

maybe bold but i wouldn't be surprised if they started the season with a 1-5 record:"
suuma810,damit schadet sich rosen doch n you are selbst. die cards haben keine nte ihn unter wert zu traden. im schlechtesten fall ist er ein preiswerter backup.
suuma810,"week 14 recap

6-1 +5.06u

overall: 51-38 +9.79u

a free throw er exchanging juice for the bigger part of the season now sitting at 57 percent !"
suuma810,despite their bad run offense against the saints matt ryan was 7/9 on play-action attem points  for 9.8 ypa versus 7.6 ypa on non-play-action attem points .
suuma810,wrong team was favored in the cin/ind game. grabbed bengals +3 early enough to collect decent +clv. bengals d had issues but offense took care of business.
ClevTA,notice during his presser how jimmy made sure to note that example of analytics and formations plays etc that fit what baker does well. makes u think
ClevTA,yeah its bowl season so they are all capable. i think michigan has a sh overtime and i think oregon wins too if i had to choose
ClevTA,right but what does cinci have to do with any of this? theres 15 teams ahead of them. th against the spread what i was laughing at
ClevTA,how do u know he wanted the job?  maybe they called and he turned them down? i know ppl who were convinced he was getting the job
ClevTA,i would have thought a 4th round pk would have been high. but for what ne does and his skill set hes going to be very valuable
ClevTA,oh i agree they should have success vs that d without mosley and williams. at this point i just want a win no matter the win diff
ClevTA,they just missed the cut. i was nervous bc they were using their 3rd string lt in seattle with the noise. trust me i was kicking myself
CizzlingSports,if the top pics were taken at the exact moment of release then it seems the plays listed in the top pics were the plays initially sold.
CizzlingSports,".upd8d   college football  betting records.

spanky,"as the nfl regular season comes to a close it should become pretty obvious how beating the nfl long term is very difficult.

-110 is very powerful."
spanky,"banning betting on state college teams is also so unnecessary. 

do they really think the only place a n.j. resident can conveniently bet rutgers is in n.j.?"
spanky,"good opportunity for anyone interested.  

i am also hiring.  

only requirement for me is if youre cool to hang out with. 
well figure out the rest eventually."
spanky,exactly.  i am part of a very v assit and integrated information network that took me 20 years to build.  n overtime much happens without me knowing...
spanky,my pov crosses economic boundaries. pay what you owe collect when  years old you are owed. if you cant operate within those guidelines move out the way.
spanky,i see frankie pellegrino picture in the background. ive sang along to my girl with him on many occasions. raos will never be the same without him.
spanky,yes wasted. had the leagues complied from the start o you are tax money used for legal fees in nj could have gone towards something more productive.
spanky,wish they would reconsider taking my action. betamerica and resorts (both sbtech joints) take me on. these guys booted me a free throw er just one day...
spanky,every time a nj shop has a losing month its assumed to be my fault.  im pretty good at what i do but n overtime that good...
spanky,what i love about living in nj/ny is the specific food that is hard to find anywhere else. h overtime pastrami on rye with a square kinish
DocBettor,feel  years old you are pain as dame killiard also killed my comfortable live under by forcing ot. when did you get the warriors at those odds?
DocBettor,hes definitely playing the draymond role for this years clippers in multiple ways including being le free throw  open by opposing teams and hated by opposing fans
PlusEVAnalytics,"i dont know if these guys are terrible at weather probability or both but 5 percent  pop this morning and its absolutely pouring.

PlusEVAnalytics,listening more closely to the lyrics the differences between we wish you a merry christmas and m.o.p.s ante up (robbin hoods theory) are purely stylistic in nature.
PlusEVAnalytics,have to go to a funeral googled the location and 20 google reviews for the church come up. who leaves a review on google for a church??
PlusEVAnalytics,had a great year? congrats. this years performance plus x percent  is next years benchmark. then we act surprised when half the population has mental health disorders.
PlusEVAnalytics,about an ho you are later i get an email from  asking me to confirm my identity by uploading my drivers license to their portal. i did.
PlusEVAnalytics,cool article but only tells half the story. a (skilled) gambler might make an excellent actuary. textbook conce points  jump to life when used in real-world applications.
PlusEVAnalytics,sports bettors will say its too much like a sl overtime machine. sl overtime players will say its too much like sports betting. nobody will play it.
aluckyaday,well as they have all signed up to the boris deal which is effectively a border in the irish sea i doubt you will have many takers!
aluckyaday,my two penneth on teasers. any bet where a fixed formula is used to convert odds from one market to a derivative market can throw up possibilities
aluckyaday,i posted  years old you are little survivorship bias thought experiment on their timeline and i've been blocked ever since. so i'm guessing they do understand it!
aluckyaday,for me rory by far the best the one that has a chance to reunite the country. raab by far the worst. the rest much the same.
aluckyaday,h overtime take: the #1 issue holding back professional gamblers is *not* bankroll management.  it is  n overtime being allowed to place positive positive expected value bets.
aluckyaday,that would be really interesting. data is here joseph. guess it would be easier for you to do as you already have the pinney data and tools?

EdMillerPoker,tbh these folks come across as the sort who devote a majority of time and resources toward things n overtime associated with being a normal functioning adult
EdMillerPoker,"we show two different totals one ""main"" and one ""alternate"". we always show the  percent  chance in terms of the  percent  of going over just by convention"
EdMillerPoker,"feedback we've gotten most so far probably is. ""wow i didn't realize how much there was to sports betting i think you've scared me off it."" ha."
EdMillerPoker,my favorite thing by far about twitter is how domain experts have conversations on the platform that otherwise would be private but instead are archived and semi-public
nonrandomalpha,i think the market is catching up tho...and both those close games were in chapel hill...line has already dropped 2+ points. n overtime in love with it.

JoeyKnish22,aggressive timeline but i like the boldness. assuming fd and dk are here asap. really hoping for some niche tribal offerings or small boutique operators (long shot).
JoeyKnish22,alber wont officially rename the bowl pool but unofficially were calling it the the knish invitational. kind of like the masters but more prestigious (and less racist).
JoeyKnish22,herbstreit yelling at  on this  college football  live show which book on the osu number as hes low key texting friends during commercial to get enough down.
JoeyKnish22,al. you sound like a fucking moron with this bullshit explanation so it makes sense you spent  years old you are professional career as an nfl official.
JoeyKnish22,"hard to recover from that sequence. redzone turnover. free set of downs.  touchdown . 

annoying football cliche but you dont beat elite teams doing that dumb shit."
JoeyKnish22,this was a good line  and you should grade the prop. there was nothing incorrect about it line just g overtime steamed. complete joke this was voided.
JoeyKnish22,hi pika! big fan! heard theres some reverse line movement tonight and its a great public fade sp overtime which i know love to bet. any thoughts?
JoeyKnish22,i can only afford to go if burrow wins the heisman so ill need to go on credit with a large bama  moneyline bet in my pending.
JoeyKnish22,dirty secret th against the spread really n overtime even so secret if youre local msus football program has been riddled with steroid use for 20+ years.
JoeyKnish22,didnt actually bet it. think seattle might park the bus was gonna take +1.5 but it steamed on me. dont have a real lean either way tbh.
JoeyKnish22,n overtime sure also a normal curse word would likely get bleeped out is that a cash? l overtime of ambiguity there. le free throw  it alone.
JoeyKnish22,had some fortune with stanford injuries but also stanford much worse than even i could have imagined. but yeah should be some nice closing line value here.
JoeyKnish22,could go 6 but 11 is key and ties reduce also im n overtime betting a l overtime of money on this even tho its gorgeous artwork.
JoeyKnish22,"quick friday  college football  h overtime take:

with all the offseason love steam money kudos. 

at this point in the market nationally utah is now wildly overrated."
JoeyKnish22,the new stuff in jersey is exponentially better. the westgate miomni one is actually pretty solid but i cant believe how bad a couple of these are.
TheKostos,in the l assit two years i'm like 1-45 in fantasy title games. i want to crawl into a pit of misery and never be seen again
TheKostos,panthers and falcons trading field goals. listen slappys  years old you are seasons are over put some mfing touchdowns on the board for fantasy purposes damn it
TheKostos,incredible incredible match and star-making stuff from keith lee. i loved it. fun pro wrestling executed at a high level. gold stars to all the workers #survivorseries
TheKostos,if i'm a panthers fan i'd rather have carli lloyd kick next week than joey slye and  it is  n overtime even close. n overtime even close
TheKostos,red zone just showed three  field goal  attem points  in a row and all three went the opposite of what i needed lol god take the wheel
TheKostos,if i were a pro handicapper the l assit part would concern me. but since i'm a host/entertainer the first part made me smile. thanks for watching.
TheKostos,what are  years old you are thoughts on the aew announce team? i think they've been tremendous and this p assit dynamite was their best one yet
TheKostos,people are certainly welcome to their opinions and heres mine: criticizing this match would be like criticizing the mona lisa. you can do it sure. but why?
TheKostos,was just chilling on milwaukee and ashland avenue in chicago very cool. more playoff  shows coming up tomorrow live from  and all over the country +  app

LockyLockerson,l overtime of nfl preseason tweeting from many in the timeline still.  n overtime time for any of that anymore may have to do some house cleaning.
LockyLockerson,thank you to those who have written reviews on amazon those have gotten put up appreciate everyone spreading the word too! enjoy  years old you are saturday.
LockyLockerson,might finally be time to turn off woj and shams notifications again.  20 tweets about the wizards gm and fiba probably a few too many for me.
LockyLockerson,also really funny that phillys best adjustment is never play boban korkmaz or bolden. amazing how much better the basketball is with those guys n overtime involved.
LockyLockerson,doing some occasional hosting and other projects for these guys a smart company and worth giving a chance! (and you can get my nba thoughts earlier sometimes)
LockyLockerson,congr against the spread to  it took about 10 very specific events all happening in a row but you finally won  years old you are baylor fade!
LockyLockerson,49 cent difference now in many places between chiefs  moneyline and mahomes mvp.  i may have to just dare one of those other chiefs to win it.
LockyLockerson,no one really cares but  for what  it is  worth  i made the 2 afc div games bal -8.7 and kc -7.7.  haven't seen the openers yet.
EliHershkovich,davey martinez was having a decent series before leaving strasburg in to hit.  years old you are best chance to get to buehler with no outs. unreal.

DannyParkins,i haven't seen a year yet where a team outside of the top 4 has a legitimate argument to say they deserve to play for the title
DannyParkins,grandal is an awesome pitch framer who takes a ton of walks. 4 year deal. nothing n overtime to like about this signing from where i sit.
DannyParkins,i cant believe youre the only person in the mentions who takes things so seriously you cant have a little fun with sports and twitter. relax dude.
DannyParkins,trubisky gets protection from 4 of 5 starters on the o-line with kyle long being the only one out. his first three snaps go handoff handoff handoff.
DannyParkins,time for #youcallit submissions for the national show. you sho overtime me a topic or question here and i'll answer them rapid fire in a segment on

chadmillman,a dictionary project that started in 1890 and once was moved to a bunker because of nuclear bomb fears. it still continues. this story is nuts.  via

chadmillman,less than 24 hours to listen to everything  said about the masters before it starts from his rankings to tigers long ball to spieths secret to success.
chadmillman,the bears are driving jordan howard is running over people and the announcers just mentioned 70s qb bob avellini. lets end the game now. wont get better.
chadmillman,see this one just hurts. he will be recording at 1est up soon a free throw er   can you ask scooch when he is posting the podcast?
Gingfacekillah,data science msc week one. there is nothing more humbling than the bottom of a learning curve. so much i dont know but excited to dig in.
Gingfacekillah,jokic falls big time short on assit 's tonight. l overtime of assisted sh overtime attem points  missed. the opportunities were there but sometimes just can't capitalize.
Gingfacekillah,one contrarian take is that we might welcome square money with its irrational overconfidence and lack of calculation to a zero sum game. caveat em point or.
Gingfacekillah,off the top of my head i would have put gsw/hou at closer to 236. but ill have to take a look at the numbers.  gl tonight!
Gingfacekillah,box score results. my player based model has no answers for the og recorded in this game. back to the drawing board. have to think about this.
Gingfacekillah,n overtime specifically. i keep most of the proprietary information to myself. although most of my general ideas and thoughts can be found on my twitter feed.
Gingfacekillah,i also believe you can use this conce point  to evaluate tipsters that are betting 2 outcome wagers like pointspreads similarly to what  has written extensively on.
logan_matthews9,nothing this week. slow getting back from nj for super bowl plus wasnt overly excited for another multi course event. back at it next week for sure
logan_matthews9,"still theres value in morikawa and hovland but n overtime taking extra. did take some kuchar at 67

logan_matthews9,michael - do you ever plan on addressing rufuss claim that you ran multiple models during the testing period? i was told you were all about transparency?
logan_matthews9,"how come its only ever the other teams b squad? 

its just such a usmnt-fan thing to do: berhalter has won every competitive game and still complaining"
logan_matthews9,i know the cs are topping out at a 4 seed next year but inject smart - hayward - tatum - brown - horford into my veins
logan_matthews9,it is a bit counter intuitive since we are basically doubling down on square lines but im seeing such huge gaps in my prediction vs the line
PikachuBets,never been so happy to look at the board and only see 10 games for tmrw. freedom is nice this must be how the founding fathers felt
PikachuBets,"pac-12 really needs to stop with these ""conference of champions"" commercial spots on national tv. they haven't been champs and ain't gonna be any no time soon"

Ccon8181,ill put this out before too much value is gone. on #warriors +2 tonight. risky as i could see warriors scratching kd and raps going to -3/-3.5
Ccon8181,props to  for his mention of #miami lykes l assit two  free throw  covering the spread of -7.5 haha. announcers/hosts should be aware of the spread imo

Ccon8181,from his fumble on l assit play of game verse stanford pulling himself in the 2nd half. scratching himself in bowl game.dude cost me lots of $
Ccon8181,the 3.5 shouldve gotten there. wades missed  free throw  was the difference between 3 and 4. n overtime smart to take worst number available so i passed.

kellyinvegas,n overtime a bad day on  g overtime caught up on the bowl games vs the social guys and had a nice day on the live show
kellyinvegas,it wasnt a good day. bills had multiple opps to cover. p against the spread g overtime screwed. saints didnt kick pat. raiders and cards were terrible.
kellyinvegas,i use a few guys numbers. i also enjoy  putting theirs up for comparison. so long answer on a neutral field i have auburn -1.5 over utah.
kellyinvegas,i will n overtime laugh if it happens to me again this weekend. i cant have back to back implosions. need a few weeks in between them.
ToddFuhrman,no sir holiday congestion so we'll have an extended cut of pro and college later this week.  l assit monday was due to some unforeseen circumstances unfortunately
ToddFuhrman,have a feeling dr coco this might be the case again because no way  can handle a deep dive of the phins without putting me to bed
ToddFuhrman,i'm sorry but who should already be onto the nlcs a free throw er blowing game 3?  hey  get  years old you are cards homers under control...
ToddFuhrman,ha there's zero panic...although the irony of gabriel catching 3 1st half  touchdown 's just n overtime the first one l assit night isn't lost on me

TheCousinSal,three weeks ago you said lamar jackson was the 9th best qb in the nfl. you should have  years old you are lips sewn shut for eternity.
TheCousinSal,my cousin  is finally doing something nice for others. his new book #theseriousgoose is out now. all the money he makes from it goes to childrens hospitals.
TheCousinSal,and i had the pleasure of shooting a comedy bit today with hue - who is for my money the most talented member of the jackson family.
TheCousinSal,theres absolutely nothing le free throw  to say about this epic federer/djokovic match. exce point  that it had better n overtime end in effing penalty kicks. #wimbledon2019
TheCousinSal,yeah but you can rest easy knowing that you advised the public to jump on that 15/1 bet as late as july 4th. oh wait...that was me.
TheCousinSal,ive always said if you and  years old you are degenerate friends stand in one sp overtime long enough they will eventually construct a billboard behind you.
TheCousinSal,breaking: bobby bonilla has decided to forego the remainder of his contract so as to n overtime have to be associated with the mets once a year.
TheCousinSal,is there a worse decision in sports than anthony joshua turning down $40 million to fight deontay wilder? save yourself the time thinking. the answer is no.
TheCousinSal,check  years old you are bible. youre totally allowed to behave like an entitled d* percent #head in the post-fight interview if you first thank jesus christ.
TheCousinSal,the degenerate trifecta and i discuss how to profit off of nba tankers ncaa conference tourney picks and  peculiar infatuation with the this is me soundtrack. #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,hey - anything that gets him off television is good by me. now how do we get flo from progressive insurance to interview for the lions job?
TheCousinSal,super-impressive 4th quarter by kansas city who proved to be the best team in the nfl. no doubt in my mind. congr against the spread chiefs fans.
12Xpert,n overtime for the 43 percent  who say they want a tory government only for the others who exhibit a moral superiority over those 43 percent .
12Xpert,the model where they offer loss leading prices for advertising purposes and close accounts of those who exploit them regularly along with other + expected value customers.
12Xpert,if european nations agree to that then fine. i'd probably be happy with it. but you have to ask the people whether that is what they want.
12Xpert,i'd have never allowed them in the first place. sportsbooks should stick to bookmaking. if they can't or won't then  daily fantasy sports  be bookmakers be casinos.
12Xpert,meanwhile in spain they are taking a different approach with judges ruling that winner restrictions are unacce point able and have been revoked. youll need to translate.
12Xpert,eating disorder strikes me as possibly the worst of them all. i found louis theroux's talking to anorexia hugely revealing disturbing upsetting and inspiring in equal measure.
12Xpert,however i'd be interested to know what these ratings are meant to be for given that it appears you can make better ratings just looking at bookmakers.
12Xpert,from memory i haven't done any specific testing on them (maybe brier score or something). i've compared the relative performances of different bookmakers. for example see here.
12Xpert,jesus then  it is  even worse since you obviously can't see they are taking you for a fool. or maybe they are clueless about this topic too
JambosPicks,"#twins crush the #rangers 13-6 and o you are  minutes  moneyline play is a winner!

see #mets and #cubs? n overtime everything has to be so dramatic!"
mschwimer,what a fantastic find! represent   although i should probably be taken out of the mix in this group as i had a 10.8 era that year.  oops.
mschwimer,and how did i respond when you asked to see the report? do you care to tell the full story? or only the part that is misleading?
mschwimer,you would be one of the only people to actually back their beliefs financially. the more like you the better for jambos. less line movement on release!
mschwimer,no opinion on  years old you are question. good news is i have a french open play as my best bet. tune in. show starts in 10min!
mschwimer,getting h overtime is always fun. sorry to disappoint but i wont be daily wager tomorrow. will be on tuesday though so make sure to tune in!
mschwimer,just wanted to take some time to thank my agents  for all the hard work and time they put into helping me on and off the field
mschwimer,my boy  completely lost his head in the first set tie break but now came back from 2-5 in the second to win it! 3rd set now!
mschwimer,dont be scared. iv been to 5 gmen games including 2007 nfc championship in green bay. giants r 5-0 when i am there and i will be
RufusPeabody,i've never understood why dislocations take time to heal. like it was popped back into place.  it is  exactly where  it is  supposed to be now.
RufusPeabody,i'm certainly n overtime saying no books will take that. plenty will. but cris typically doesn't -- at le assit that has been my personal experience.
RufusPeabody,so youre saying  years old you are model doesnt beat the market. which runs counter to all  years old you are claims of  moneyline knowing all
RufusPeabody,i also said that i have no idea what criteria goes into winning the heisman and how much it matters if you're on a great team.
RufusPeabody,i had ou as 63 percent  to finish the season undefeated going into today so i  daily fantasy sports  think them winning out is a stretch.

RufusPeabody,just when you thought nfl gms were getting a little smarter... special shout out to the rams front office which doesn't seem to have any clue.
RufusPeabody,this is a regulation billy. i lived in vegas for many years and i'm sure any of the bookmaker/industry people out there will back that up.
RufusPeabody,it takes skill -- and statistical models -- to find the value. the true win rate of sports bettors does n overtime follow a normal distribution.
RufusPeabody,this is a good point. they're evaluating based on what info they have. it also leads to a huge advantage for someone who's successfully executed before.
RufusPeabody,i meant in terms of the big game management decisions. he made all the right calls going for it on 4th downs and going for two.
jeffma,ill come on if you can give me a reasonable answer on twitter why  years old you are data scientists recommended a teaser through zero.... go
SportsCheetah,haha wish i had actually bet it i was just mentioning the move up from 49.5 to 51.5 at the time and mad i missed out.
SportsCheetah,lawrence draw had been the nuts all game. saving that delayed fake draw semi jump pass to etienne over middle was the stone cold super nuts.
SportsCheetah,i was vs okie st and baylor the l assit 2 weeks but the market moved that way by kickoff (11 to 14 8 to 10).
SportsCheetah,i think  thoughts on osuna here and cole out of pen to end it if houston escapes the inning are at the very le assit intriguing.
SportsCheetah,well you  daily fantasy sports  see gunned out at home off of an error in the infield very o free throw en. hell of a game.
capjack2000,"it warms my heart to login to  and see lehigh/lafayette at the top of the  college football  betting board. 

college footballs most played rivalry. 

#betwithyourheart
#hailallhaillehigh"
capjack2000,betc assit showed the sixers +220 in live betting when they were down by 13. that should play well when the knicks collapse in the 4q.
capjack2000,"well esports wagering is alive in nj.  let us  play my old favorite sesame street game:

which one of these is n overtime like the other?"
capjack2000,"this would be the best method as well...that or making a friend in nj. 

for some people social engineering is far more difficult than computer engineering."
capjack2000,i  daily fantasy sports  believe so. just entrants into the contest see the top 50 and their own place on the list. hopefully dk improves that.
capjack2000,i wish i was quick enough to snap a pic but a free throw er a 48-7 drubbing to maryland... it is  tough to think straight.
capjack2000,lower barriers to entry are good in theory but marketing spend is still uncapped. the billion dollar companies are going to continue to dominate via that.
capjack2000,this one is a few years old...i had bet that the first pitch of the game (world series) by jake arrieta would be a ball +120.
capjack2000,my advice for new players...fire it on a parlay. n overtime too o free throw en i tell people to bet parlays but this is one.
capjack2000,they're still the smartest guys in the industry. nothing would destroy the offshore industry faster than letting the key talent be hired by legal market operators.
capjack2000,yeaaaah....n overtime for everyone...and n overtime on everything. however  it is  easier to come back at cris with multiple accounts than it is a bm book.
capjack2000,"uses miomni in nv. if they do enter wv they would probably want to rethink that. 

i dont think they have any interest in wv though."
capjack2000,yeah id withdraw too if they limited me to $25 on nba. ive g overtime $0.10 in my dk account because it resembles a middle finger.
capjack2000,seriously. if  thinks someone hitting a royal flush on video poker is absurd. theyre n overtime going to l assit too long as a casino operator.
capjack2000,the movement on black panther from +2400 to +700 back to +2100 and back to +700 all during the broadc assit has been the bigger story.

dinkinc,i think my lack of sleep from taking care of hazel was the cause for this tweet.  it doesnt hold up too well in the morning

dinkinc,"this would be much more helpful if she was the president... we should look at mr trump""s history with women and pedophiles... he matters right now"

robpizzola,especially with hfa in the playoffs coming out of the bye week being the largest hfa that any team has over the course of the season.
robpizzola,so why doesn't the media do both? this is my point. the focus is always on the negative... a constant pessimistic viewpoint on everything in toronto.
robpizzola,a free throw er watching a quarter and a bit of this game i have no idea why either of these teams would run the ball.
robpizzola,pitt was my biggest play entering today. i ended up with fo you are that were larger than that... they went 2-2 for a small loss.

RASPicks,there are plenty of criticisms of the ras service. some are valid others are not. we just published a page addressing most of the common ones:

RASPicks,a closing line value of 3 points per pick in a market as big as  college football  is more to do with agreement/validation than a following.
VegasRefund,the timing of the anthony barr fallout couldnt have been more perfect for bell.. has to be leveraging the hell out of the jets right now.
VegasRefund,now with the rams dline being the main factor to them winning this game in my opinion.. then someone on their dline should have mvp value..
VegasRefund,if i had one sports related wish that couldnt be used on one of my homer teams.. it be for tiger to win one more major.
ProfessorShine,one more bowl season of huge swath of players sitting out will get an 8 team playoff.  im for 10 and top 2 get a bye.
ProfessorShine,aikman seems surprised with packer fans braving cold weather.  i know he played there ar le assit twice in his career.  i remember the 45-17 waxing
ProfessorShine,because th against the spread too smart.  but he will get a ton of advertising from the ws bet alone.  every media outlet loves this story
ProfessorShine,no guarantee coach will even follow it.   organization has to be committed to these decisions.  like p against the spread and now the eagles. even colts
ProfessorShine,"the ""iggy is hof"" is comical.  but if it were up to me i'd hurl 25 percent  of inductee busts in all sports into the woods."
ProfessorShine,top rank and al haymon hate each other.  and as much as id like to see it casual fans have no clue who either guy is
ProfessorShine,semi-anonymity is due to betting limits and profiling. ive never used it to do baseless attacks.   my issues with tan are fair. maybe address the issues?
suuma810,"jason garrett didnt call one of his three timeouts a free throw er the sack.

wasted 20 seconds that should have led to a  touchdown  opportunity."
suuma810,if we see the gronk we have been watching all season its gonna be tough for him to get open a l overtime against those safeties.
suuma810,i dont think that was all in hacketts interest. as if marrone said: we g overtime the lead dont make anything stupid. just hand it off.
suuma810,the point is that they get more unpredictable without fournette open up the passing game and go more pass-heavy on early downs which is more efficient.
suuma810,i think we shouldn't be arguing the fact that having solid qb play over the next five years is more valuable than having a good rb
ClevTA,17-39 (43.6 percent ) for 146 yds (3.7 yds/att) 6 sacks. i  daily fantasy sports  see the josh allen lovers this week for some reason. strange
ClevTA,dude lighten up. clay is a pos so its a national p assit time to f with him. i pick on him bc he deserves it
ClevTA,id keep ridley over hebert. prob since theres some potential cannobilizing with the same team i think keep gordon. th against the spread a coin flip
ClevTA,i just dont understand how that guy isnt smart enough to intentionally have a few losing sessions mixed in so nobody can tell u are cheating
ClevTA,no idea what mike is arguing about. besides the fact u cant review illegal man downfield its a scoring play so nothing is challengeable for cinci
ClevTA,and this is why i was beyond shocked the p against the spread would ever sign ab. this was never the same as moss or dillon
ClevTA,u could find much worse backup qbs than simien. if the browns were consensus -2.5 before the darnold news i would personally price this around -4/4.5
CizzlingSports,.also bonus points for again linking to a 12/26/18 post that excludes  years old you are abysmal bowl game picks from l assit season. well done

spanky,no i dont but games fall 10 way more o free throw en than they fall 9. knowing what each half point is worth is paramount.
spanky,exactly.  years old you are primary focus is media with betting being secondary. everyone knows this as you readily admit it. yet  still bans you!  unbelievable
spanky,the ballys bathrooms are so nasty and attract such a shitty crowd that they put a sign on the bathroom saying no changing of clothes allowed
spanky,being successful at selling a great product is easier yet still challenging.  being successful at selling a shitty product puts  in a class of his own.
spanky,never pay 10 cents for a half point on a total in basketball.  football however is a different story but i can't reveal all my secrets
spanky,i've played into many offshore exchanges from betmaker to matchbook to betfair etc.  i have never once witnessed a liquid  college basketball  on any of them.
spanky,this documentary aired a week a free throw er douglass defeated tyson. i find it fascinating how larry merchant is so bold with his tyson insults

PlusEVAnalytics,i know its a l overtime more complicated in reality but all the headlines of pro democracy party wins by landslide in election make me lol.
PlusEVAnalytics,in play metrics like yards gained are at best a less noisy proxy for actual results. i wouldnt look at it as a substitute for clv.
PlusEVAnalytics,i hope this creates an accounting burden that haunts  years old you are finance division like a bad case of herpes for the next 20 years.
PlusEVAnalytics,what i mean is (and apologies if youve already done this) is there any signal in 538 info residual to the signal in the pinnacle odds?
aluckyaday,highly unlikely to happen. sports lines have no underlying asset value. they are n overtime securities. gambling is n overtime the primary purpose of financial instruments.
aluckyaday,could do with a few more subscribers though the 1 a liter wine is perfectly drinkable but the 1.59 a bottle stuff is so much better
aluckyaday,if you can bet with skybet norway at 28/1 each way first five is probably the closest you will get to a + expected value bet.
aluckyaday,these adverts give me the impression that the people at gamble aware have read lots of surveys but have never placed a bet in their life!
aluckyaday,bit unfair on jungles if he is asked to eat wind today. guess  that is  the price you have pay for being with the top team.
theFirmAISports,"justin herbert is the most overrated qb this year! why does espn have him on the heisman house voting but n overtime tyler huntley? 
#heismanhouse #huntleyforheisman"
theFirmAISports,this is a simulation with a 4 percent  edge on every bet over 256 bets... you'll have a losing season roughly 31.4 percent  of the time
joeytunes2,footballs back as we  all know from the steady winners being feed to my followers. now  it is  time to # feed me  #outs #accounts #sportsbetting
joeytunes2,being a pro is hardly any days off if you miss days you miss money. and  it is  a market that does n overtime shut off.
joeytunes2,"i personally like mich -1 but smart people i talk to love tt ..

purdue wins tonight as well as i think gonzaga does..

good luck"
joeytunes2,it is  so sikkkk. i'm actually watching it laughing. he makes people look like they never played defense. in today's game no one actually plays defense.
joeyisaks,if someone in basketball coaching circles came up with a new way to sho overtime and every team copied the techniques i touchdown  be that guy
joeyisaks,shapalov mighta been the worst bet on the board today garin clay st against the spread going back to junior french shoulda made him -200 ish
joeyisaks,th against the spread fine but you would be better off just betting against them on a day to day basis rather than win total under
EdMillerPoker,if anything i think a defining difference between booking in us and booking row is how relatively few relevant events there are for the us market.
EdMillerPoker,no interest in engaging a proxy. but im sure you will find takers to bet o you are stuff into you if you offer fair rules.
EdMillerPoker,"most of the $ they lose to ""winning bettors"" could be fixed with sharper lines. for the most part winning bettors are just picking off mistakes."
EdMillerPoker,incidentally if/when most volume moves to in-play this will be a much harder determination esp for anyone who is conscious to avoid certain tell betting behaviors
EdMillerPoker,my only thought is for that guy's sake i hope auburn wins. ( for what  it is  worth  i think you're just seeing them reported more)
EdMillerPoker,i think so yes was gonna wait to see if sales justified the investment but sales have be v strong so far. no eta yet tho.
EdMillerPoker,great article this is also o you are vision of where things are going so its nice to see we arent alone in this big world
EdMillerPoker,i understand he nearly died in katrina and he made his way to texas to continue teaching chess to children there for more than a decade.
EdMillerPoker,also seems like the event is a lock to be a success from dk perspective. so it'll no doubt be back bigger and better next yr.

LeeSharpeNFL,just gonna steal robert mays idea and put this game on mute for a while.  let us  all stop reliving the 2017 dra free throw .
LeeSharpeNFL,there's only one game at a time today but if you're out and about with family today or tomorrow my live scoreboard will keep you updated:
LeeSharpeNFL,"my partner is feeling ill so had to leave to take care of them for 20 minutes and i missed.... a bills  field goal .

ok."
LeeSharpeNFL,this is a really interesting set of qbs and i'm excited to see how this pol turns out. will repost again for the morning crowd tomorrow.
LeeSharpeNFL,"is this a ""might as well keep trubisky healthy n overtime winning this"" chase daniel or a ""finally i admit it mitch trubisky sucks"" chase daniel?!"
LeeSharpeNFL,still probably going to watch redzone but just watching hou at bal instead is really tem point ing. will have it up on a second screen.
LeeSharpeNFL,i hate this so much. especially if i'm also watching a stream or playing a game while code runs. my computer *cannot* handle it sometimes. :(
whale_capper,a free throw er glowing about the chiefs for all of 2018-19 and then having dee ford shatter their season you're better off without my support
whale_capper,new deep dive is live... we surveyed the damage from a poor week 2 and try to make sense out of the state of the nfl...
whale_capper,monday night football  scope coming up at ht of this saints game... great news will n overtime feature any booger or false flags may feature winners...
whale_capper,sure i thought before the playoffs started the most likely outcome was dubs over raps in 5 but i kinda think the raps shouldve swe point
whale_capper,im a little blinded by rage by the way the rockets continue to blow this but i do think dubs 2h over is a decent look
whale_capper,expecting they have known kanter was out since game 5 and have a plan in place to put aminu or similar on jokic and play small
whale_capper,ill probably look for some under in the 4q... potential for  overtime wipes out some value on the pregame under otherwise id probably play that too
AndyMSFW,if indy punches this in i will have won a full game over and lost a full game under by hal free throw ime today.  #historic
AndyMSFW,"this guy doesn't own a house.

AndyMSFW,i tried l assit night by explaining that i've also dislocated my kneecap.  turns out no one cares that i slipped on some ice in 2010.
AndyMSFW,you bet!  the hated moondogs took down my honkers.  but they did let everyone come on the field a free throw erwards for a fireworks show.
AndyMSFW,"round 3 match-up recap:

JoeyKnish22,"i dont know whose idea it was to tee up pizzola right before me so im n overtime gonna overreact. 

but i want them fired immediately."
JoeyKnish22,assuming you guys were keeping this thread going cause youre expecting me to give you leeches a couple free nba picks? cause its n overtime happening.
JoeyKnish22,"worst  college football  bet of the year? i took central michigan under 4.5 rsw. 

theyre gonna win the west division and play for the mac championship."
JoeyKnish22,most of the comments were mindless bad takes but this i semi-agree with. no team wants to deal with the media distraction regardless of his ability.
JoeyKnish22,if you dont see any tweets from  today its because hes at the bank seeing if he can wire transfer his entire 401k to malzahns representatives.
JoeyKnish22,just worked out ravens g overtime the combo of competitive expected road loss to elite team + 3 division losses + really poor perf from browns/steelers.

TheKostos,imagine needing tyler lockett to do anything tonight in fantasy and he's dancing in the end zone a free throw er david moore catches a  touchdown
TheKostos,going to lose eagles against the spread  on the fourth down long  touchdown  to parker and that insane fake field goal. lol. what can ya do?
TheKostos,second half of the soccer season (aka once football ends) is going to be soooo dope. cant wait to have more time to dig into it
TheKostos,going live at 6pm et for an abbreviated  we'll talk openly and honestly about everything going on. i have no notes pr expected points added red.
TheKostos,i bet butler and nc state overnight. also considering d expected points added ul. will give out full card tonight in the 6pm ho you are
TheKostos,at worst  it is  second behind empire strikes back but if we're talking harrison leading roles there's no question. and it might be better than empire
TheKostos,tonight's college card is gross and some numbers have already gotten away from what i was originally looking at. hopefully his eminence  will have some winners
TheKostos,sandgren was literally talking to himself like a crazy person. dude was in his own head. djokovic might beat fed so bad he has to retire
TheKostos,the big story to me is how good edge was. i mean that was elite performing right there and he'd be gone for nearly a decade
TheKostos,i cant get the thought out of my head of those two parents with their kids on a helico point er going down im just gutted
TheKostos,michigan is one of those bets that makes you feel like you're on the truman show and the world is playing a practical joke on you
LockyLockerson,i just realized this is probably a coach of the year elimination game.  winner advances to face shanahan in the final showdown weeks 16 and 17.
LockyLockerson,when the heat go on to win by 30 just remember i was the one who live bet the mavs right now.  9:09pm et.  timestamp it.
LockyLockerson,ra point ors already home and now the bulls sweat is on.  theyre only playing the best team in the league how bad could it go?
LockyLockerson,yeah i mean  it is  a great story and worthy of attention.  just why even have to apply like sports ranking culture to it ya know?
LockyLockerson,yeah a bunch of reasons for all why i kinda cooled off since tuesday definitely n overtime on the other side or anything just prefer others
LockyLockerson,i might set up the patreon today and can provide a full explanation.  otherwise dm me and ill respond in an ho you are or two.
LockyLockerson,"1p for tonight:

la-van u1.5 (4.7 percent  at -105)

was -101 earlier but was in the middle of a puppy dog pals marathon.  so be it."
LockyLockerson,nw basically scored a  field goal  vs. what is now perceived as a bad stanford team then had a week off and didn't cover vs unlv.
LockyLockerson,i would tell you to bet georgia tech but i think  that is  a journey i need to make alone if i make it at all.
LockyLockerson,my guess is they are completely full of shit but hey what do i know maybe 10 or fewer preseason games is enough to draw conclusions
LockyLockerson,just understand this is so far from anger.  its genuinely funny.  this episode was funny.  i love earth.  what are we gonna get obsessed with next.
LockyLockerson,"sorry about that my fault!  usually if  it is  a first-game injury or ""new"" injury  that is  what i mean.  but i can definitely be clearer."
LockyLockerson,hadnt watched any nba today and turned on the l assit 4  minutes of jazz rockets.  what a great decision that was.  man what a shot.

chadmillman,only  could pitch this idea l assit night in slack and have it ready to share with you this morn. a thanksgiving gi free throw .

chadmillman,just going to put this on a loop. scotus rules in favor of sports betting. coverage on the ruling and what it means immediately for you.

Gingfacekillah,unfortunately amazon only lets me run a pre-order for the kindle edition. the paperback edition will be available when the book is officially released in august.
Gingfacekillah,ultimately my collection of models has wolves winning 2-0 (38.51 percent ) as the second most likely outcome just behind the draw 1-1 (40.92 percent ).
logan_matthews9,god have i missed sweating mls matches all saturday long. the only thing that will make it better is when we add in usl next weekend

TheCousinSal,what a game! undefeated minnesota is for real.  and theyre for real going to lose by 21+ to ohio st. in the big 10 championship game.
TheCousinSal,n overtime sure what to do about replay anymore. the saints were short by 3/4 yard easy and the refs refused to overturn their shitty decision.

RufusPeabody,conflict resolution -- liaison between bettors and regulatory authorities/books if disputes arise. (note that this doesn't mean we would blindly support all bettors in disputes.)
RufusPeabody,great bit on ravens building around who lamar jackson is rather than trying to turn him into something different. ravens organization is a great model.
RufusPeabody,yep. though the way i'm doing it i'm getting both value based on market moving my way and value based on line shopping in it.
RufusPeabody,th against the spread like saying imagine statistics can beat the market. regression analysis has made me lots of money. great tool for answering questions
RufusPeabody,i actually agree with that. i would have been finished by the time i actually g overtime on the plane (if i had the opportunity)
RufusPeabody,people have to take you at  years old you are word that you have a top 10 accounting firm auditing  years old you are plays.
RufusPeabody,"him: ""i'm paul""
me: ""hey paul i'm rufus""
him: ""rufus?""

RufusPeabody,the super bowl is one of the only events where public money is driving the line. (world cup also) you are cherrypicking a few events.
jeffma,who did i call an asshole? i dont think you are an asshole. but in  years old you are defense i have never met you
jeffma,probably get that tattoo removed. i would never ro overtime against my teams. even with lots of $$ against them. just n overtime in me

jeffma,it isnt a joke. it is a real question. legitimately the eagles would seem like the public side... yet line has moved away from them.

SportsCheetah,interestingly enough jabari has the third-worst opponent e field goal  percent  difference when he's on the floor for the hawks. opponents are 7.7 percent  better.
SportsCheetah,the shots vermont is making here at uva are pretty nuts. career-high now for anthony lamb up to 30. upset in the brewing at jpj.
SportsCheetah,yup its useful for bettors but it also helps the average fan gauge what they are watching in a way beyond just the actual score.

capjack2000,good article here by  on an issue that i think keeps getting more important as more states come online. granular self-exclusion is important and necessary.

ProfessorShine,about to compliment herm than i saw the 3rd and 5 play to setup a punt to net themselves 19 yards.  burned only 14 seconds
ProfessorShine,the arrogance of these guys is why they get such blowback.  his tweet alluding that he basically just wants tan to get acquired was telling
ProfessorShine,and bran has been laying low giving zero info exce point  about his wheelchair cause he knows theyre gonna crown his ass in the end.
ProfessorShine,you mean bad job for gold sheet every year.  apparently  and that sam guy from  think hes good for radio but he has no edge
suuma810,i've found that some push probabilities are n overtime very accurate. looking up real pinnacle prices at a site like  is a more sound approach.
suuma810,only reason seems like markets value the loss of clowney more or simply buyback a free throw er it ticked up off the luck retirement.
suuma810,"eagles -3 was a no-sweat winner l assit night 

fyi: steam moves have no correlation to a team's performance!  daily fantasy sports  overreact to this."

ClevTA,oh yeah. considering i was in attendance bet the buckeyes and this bad beat sparked  bad be against the spread segment. its an unforgettable highlight
ClevTA,bc a bunch had asked. from tuesday. this was in reference to eagles and browns spreads. thought those were the farthest off my personal numbers
ClevTA,that is  completely false. lines are way over adjusted n overtime adjusted accordingly. a 1 gm sample size isnt nearly enough to make proper adjustments
ClevTA,but dont worry obj is the real problem child wr in the nfl i was told. havent heard a negative peep about him all summer
ClevTA,read the part about the browns using 11 personnel 85 percent  of the time in preseason which hed be the 3rd wr in those spots.

spanky,second day at  .  i still am getting 500 on cb totals. i told supervisors  said i get higher limits but they didnt believe me
spanky,my opinion is probably wrong.  nfl players make too much money to mess around. i just think it looked shady th against the spread all.

DocBettor,i suggest saving time and just using up to date pre-dra free throw  rankings. leagues are mostly won on in-season waivers and good injury luck
DocBettor,does any mock dra free throw  have sekou doumbouya going before cam reddish? there is  money to be made on prop bets #nbadra free throw
PlusEVAnalytics,actually im wrong. in a parimutuel system an average skilled bettor is losing 25c on the dollar. an unskilled bettor is losing more than that.
PlusEVAnalytics,g overtime to always be thinking a few moves ahead. in 25 years there might be more demand for bollywood film critics than for actuaries...
PlusEVAnalytics,so ref to my original post theyre assuming a and b are constant...which maybe they are. but if theyre n overtime we can beat them.
PlusEVAnalytics,todays weird stuff promoted into my timeline. yes i was physically in an airport this morning so...i must be in the market for airplane toilets??
PlusEVAnalytics,yes th against the spread the right family of models. just n overtime sure if this specific type of application is a thing that exists.
aluckyaday,i would be very surprised if you can create anything more than natural growth in liquidity in a market that is in essence zero sum.
aluckyaday,but forex markets do n overtime exist for speculation. it is n overtime speculation that creates the liquidity but the primary purpose of those markets.
aluckyaday,be nice to him. you would be in a bad mood too if you had been dragged around manhattan all morning on piece of string

EdMillerPoker,its easy to say youre gonna do this but its hard to build  for what  it is  worth . agree its a major unsolved problem.
EdMillerPoker,this is n overtime a theoretical concern either. the current state of nfl data is its n overtime good enough to deal in-game markets from.
EdMillerPoker,a very smart person who nevertheless  s taleb and naval philosoprene you are nuggets at a frequency far beyond what basic decency might reasonably permit

gonna tune in to see the next bears qb should be really exciting."
LeeSharpeNFL,wait really? the fox map at the bottom suggests sf/bal is basically being shown everywhere that doesn't have a local market team playing on fox:
LeeSharpeNFL,this is challenging because if the goal were different (e.g. measure the team) then x-axis definitely makes sense as-is. i can see the argument though.
LeeSharpeNFL,a free throw er starting 0-3 the steelers are 5-4 and would be a playoff team if the playoff teams were determined as of now.

robpizzola,took a real hit to their forward de point h and their goaltending is still an abomination. i think 95 is a fair number.
robpizzola,timo meiers deal is far and away the best team deal of the day. nothing remotely close. timo needs to fire his agent asap.

ProfessorShine,way too early before the dra free throw  and odds will change.    id favor houst and milw now but n overtime with real cash

ClevTA,i mean random end of season wins have zero effect on the future. mangini running the table years back was irrelevant the next season
ClevTA,drops def an issue but baker overthrows him by 50 feet 2-3 times per game. th against the spread been a much bigger issue
ClevTA,kyler looks to run it non stop exce point  when he has enough space to score on 4th down.  what the fuck  was that
ClevTA,u sound like a reasonable person. good and rare to see that here. if u have any questions or need advice just message me
ClevTA,totally diff tho since browns are at home and dont have to deal with noise. also rams are dead l assit in pressures allowed
ClevTA,plz tell me u heard the sal job interview this morning. im n overtime sure ive ever laughed so hard. guy is a genius

PlusEVAnalytics,this could be why the question asks for sqrt(x-3) instead of for x. its the worlds smallest roadblock but its the thought that counts?
PlusEVAnalytics,im starting to wonder if theres anyone actually betting these picks or if whoever has bought his package is just betting on the guarantee.
PlusEVAnalytics,is 2nd  1 such a sneakily valuable thing that guys should be giving themselves up a free throw er gaining 9 on 1st down?
PlusEVAnalytics,what do you think the venn diagram is between only morons buy picks from touts and my retirement is in actively managed mutual funds?
PlusEVAnalytics,efficiency is one of those things that can never be proven only disproven. it sucks but th against the spread the way it is.
PlusEVAnalytics,probably the only way to do it sustainably without screwing over  years old you are customers or starting some flash boys type bullshit tho
PlusEVAnalytics,the payoff is n overtime worth the risk. put the money in the stock market and use the time volunteering at a soup kitchen.
PlusEVAnalytics,this thread was about why n overtime to buy picks. why n overtime to sell them is a different discussion for a different day...
PlusEVAnalytics,also something tells me that any asshole who wants a parimutuel license can get one and theyre just too cheap to pay the fee.
PlusEVAnalytics,i would guess that the number of vix traders doing it for speculative purposes far outweighs the number doing it as a legitimate hedge.
aluckyaday,personally i would think nfl is king because it is the most popular sport and n overtime really because of the mechanics of betting.

adamchernoff,hey there the books have all been shipped out. may have a few more available next week but for now they have been sold.
adamchernoff,the mean of the team hits gets weighted positively/negatively based on the starting pitchers hits per inning allowed and bullpen hits per inning allowed.
adamchernoff,haha. i think they are pretty good. back running about 85 percent  which is more than good enough for the podc assit and articles.

TheCousinSal,i realize tampa bay hasnt had the ball yet but its 1:07pm et and jameis still hasnt thrown a pick.  starting to get worried.
TheCousinSal,bad job by espn here n overtime replaying that burrow toss (and the hit he took) which was a top 5 pass this year.
TheCousinSal,very un-patriots here. josh allen had no intention on having over 50 yards passing today and ne let him right back in this game.
TheCousinSal,wagered on this dandy of a parlay the other day. odds have undoubtedly changed since reports of staffords busted up back were released. #winner
TheCousinSal,an actual devil ray should sting me in the neck to teach me a lesson for betting on tampa bay today. #30innings #noruns #nojoke
TheCousinSal,this match was a roller coaster for bettors as well who at certain points couldve live-wagered djokovic at +800 and federer at +600. #wimbledon2019
TheCousinSal,awful clock management by pats/brady at the end of the half there. lets see if they can recover. i for one have my doubts.
TheCousinSal,up 30 points in the fourth quarter - jason garrett just went for it on 4th and 1 from the opponents 42.  #princetonpride #headscratcher
TheCousinSal,a brand new against all odds podc assit featuring incredible tales from degenerate gambler turned comedian turned degenerate gambler  +  founder ian epstein. #gambling
TheCousinSal,another curious call by pete carroll to go for 2 there.  he should just fire himself whenever shawks have the ball inside the 3.
TheCousinSal,n overtime sure why anyone has conor. this thing is over in 2.  anything more is fictional tv of game of thrones proportions. #mayweathervmcgregor
TheCousinSal,impressive finish for andre ward who may have the biggest heart in boxing. love to see him lose 55 lbs and fight conor. #wardkovalev2
TheCousinSal,i just announced there will no longer be an audience at my house for the foreseeable future. wife and kids are on their own.
TheCousinSal,im going to say what everyones thinking. giannis sitting a couple of games leaves the door wide open for an avery bradley mvp run.
12Xpert,i haven't. if it works bet it and make money. if others have already thought of it and the edge has gone basically irrelevant.
12Xpert,to reiterate because the method uses pinnacle's odds to measure 'true' probabilities  it is  methodologically impossible for value bets to be found at pinnacle.
12Xpert,actually i dont think you need to exactly quantify  years old you are edge for every bet to make it work. just the average.
12Xpert,"i'm guessing you found it because you deleted  years old you are tweet but just in case here it is: 
also in the book."
12Xpert,yes it probably would but expect them to ban you if you exploit this systematically as so free throw  books do for racing bog.
12Xpert,so here is part 2. do bookmaker's bias an nba spread market? hmmm i'm n overtime sure. levitt's work might be out of date.
12Xpert,i believe  may be doing something with ranked probability scores to look at how bookmakers models compare. perhaps he can give you some info.

mschwimer,you really think those guys would risk their reputations over a few million dollars? you really have no idea how the business world works.
mschwimer,it does n overtime require trusting me at all. it requires trusting bill miller marvin bush david ganek and steve duncker. look them up.
mschwimer,thank you. feels good to get off the schneid. need to win my best bet today and then we could have a streak going!

RufusPeabody,im n overtime bragging. i said i lost overall!! i do try to help others. i gave out woodland as a play on
RufusPeabody,n overtime a two-way market so public can drive down the price without sharps being able to come in and balance it out.
RufusPeabody,n overtime sure why you hate the article so much. spanky saw an opportunity in the sports betting world and he exploited it.
RufusPeabody,why do hockey teams pull their best goalie just because he allowed a few goals? seems like an overreaction to small sample size.

RufusPeabody,it is  similar to betting the haws to win the 18-19 nba championship if their roster was made up of middle school kids.
RufusPeabody,yeah but its n overtime a two way market. overround is what 150 percent ? ticket worth n overtime worth close to that
RufusPeabody,love the idea. the problem is cost. there are a ton of sites and even more play types and they're n overtime cheap.
RufusPeabody,what it is is a good deal for the syndicate  that is  getting the good prices and a bad deal for everyone else.

robpizzola,i didn't play the game tonight... was hoping for allen for stl and would have probably ended up with an edge on cbj.
robpizzola,my cab driver just heard this on the radio and he might legitimately drive us off the road because hes laughing so hard.
robpizzola,if he had come out and said kawhi needed a breather id be ok with it. but im n overtime ok with this.
robpizzola,hopefully well get to hear the stars owner tee off on benn for his lack of heart a free throw er the game.
robpizzola,odds are that there wouldn't have been 2 in my lifetime considering there's only two 1v8 matchups each season. this is my point.
RASPicks,o you are final  college basketball  season record is right on o you are home page:  and has been there throughout the season.
RASPicks,i'd rather n overtime get into details but it is a competitive market and unfortunately there are downsides to maintaining a public archive.
RASPicks,"""transparency"" is a buzz word used at many handicapping sites but very few are actually transparent with their plays and long term records."
RASPicks,if you can prove that we took a private offer on totals i'll run pregame banners on ras/bt for a year.  we didn't.
RASPicks,human error on the one release caused page to n overtime display pick e-mail went out fine.  we graded it 1/2 point less.

ProfessorShine,she posted on vegas insider for years.  and that is at cherry picked lines that are o free throw en n overtime usable.

suuma810,it is  easy: i send them out to all members who paid for a monthly or season membership at my website - .
suuma810,jop. die defense ist grandios aber der momentane level ist den gegnern/qbs geschuldet. wird s point estens nach der bye week anders aussehen.
suuma810,wenn man sich das de point h chart der texans anschaut kann man gar nicht overpayen. dazu wird der fette clowney vertrag gespart.
suuma810,podc assit time! talked to    about the handicapping process for #nfl win totals. we also digged into some teams and their 2019 outlooks
suuma810,incase you missed it : carolina #panthers team preview for 2019 with two intriguing situational spots  a lean on the season win total.
suuma810,agreed. in some stages of the game their play calling was questionable. rams couldnt defend kamara throw him the ball every first down.
suuma810,the saints had three first down runs for a combined one yard. they also had one int but that was a punt too.
suuma810,addressed that game on my podcast. strong hfa vikes no identity on offense cousins cant beat good teams / take over these games.
suuma810,#broncos play-calling might be the worst. they dont realize the texans are a top-5 run defense and are banged up on their secondary.
suuma810,n overtime involved but titans/bills is one of those games where we all might say why didnt we bet the titans in hindsight.
suuma810,"weekly members podc assit for week one is online! called it ""milking the book"" because  that is  what we wanna do this season"

spanky,to publicly admit youre wrong shows  years old you are level of maturity.  n overtime that my admiration means anything but im impressed!

PlusEVAnalytics,cool article h/t   i always suspected that this world existed. now i can teach the 6 years old son to become an ap.
PlusEVAnalytics,todays weird stuff promoted into my tl. how not-a-cyclist am i? not-a-cyclist enough that i figured saddle soreness was some kind of euphemism.
PlusEVAnalytics,okay and how does the buyer tell the difference between you and the 99 other people trying to sell him the same story?
PlusEVAnalytics,pffff free throw . the best case ceiling on people watching a major who have money on it is what 3 percent ?
PlusEVAnalytics,the moral of action is all you have to do is be the second scummiest guy/girl in the room and youre a hero.
PlusEVAnalytics,what theyre trying to avoid (for some reason) is put $10k on the ponies and ill give you 10k on sf at +120
aluckyaday,n overtime sure which is the more scary. she has to fact check everything or that she is using google to do it!
aluckyaday,so now you are n overtime a tout but financial investment advisors? are you registered with the sec or any state securities authorities?
aluckyaday,all gamblers want to win but they  daily fantasy sports  expect to. you have a healthy casino market. why is that any different?
aluckyaday,n overtime the first time i have thought it is too hard for  touchdown g and been wrong. probably wont be the last!
aluckyaday,is that necessarily true? one parties may be betting for entertainment purposes. n overtime many people are more right than a roulette wheel!
theFirmAISports,we g overtime hit hard by the 2 big upsets... still cant believe brees and tommy boy are out in the wildcard games..
theFirmAISports,so green was only good when he had all the real all stars on the court too right? is that what youre saying?
theFirmAISports,michigans likelihood of missing 18 straight 3s = 0.04 percent . michigans chance of winning with those shooting numbers comes down substantially haha

EdMillerPoker,i expect most of the selfdriving testing to happen in china where there will be less.. uh.. friction in the politics of it
EdMillerPoker,this is marshall. hes fo you are months old and he likes waking up at 3am chewing everything and running around in circles.
EdMillerPoker,"the real value is n overtime in the idea but in the execution

one of the few real things i learned in adulthood"
EdMillerPoker,most in-play bets are on the final outcome of a game just like pregame bets and therefore require no special data to grade.
EdMillerPoker,it will be out june 4. i'm n overtime sure when it will be ready to preorder it depends on what amazon decides.
EdMillerPoker,sports betting is a game and the markets are toys. dont think its a good place to look for counter examples to  thesis.
EdMillerPoker,i made a model for this its called dollars per war and it says every gm is an idi overtime please hire me
EdMillerPoker,i think that environment will be very very hard on the lower market share books that also want to operate at hi margins

LeeSharpeNFL,"hey he's gone from ""mocking"" to ""n overtime understanding but at le assit trying to use what he thinks of as buzzwords"".

LeeSharpeNFL,i assume pete carroll is just trying to keep the packers out of the #1 seed and i thank him for his service.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the best c assit outcome for this challenge is they have 3rd and 1 and go back 10 yards near midfield.

horrible challenge."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is also how i feel when watching a chiefs game.

anyway please pick six trubisky multiple times tonight thank you in advance."
LeeSharpeNFL,"you know you're using r a l overtime when you try to type ""nah"" but  years old you are phone autocorrects to ""na""."
LeeSharpeNFL,"thanks!

i can do that. if you're sending me css feel free to just make up classes/ids and and i can insert them."
LeeSharpeNFL,oh interesting! are you just taking all 22 and sort of translating the video images? are humans watching film and making classifications manually?
LeeSharpeNFL,what's really amazing is neither of these teams is good nor do they have a first round dra free throw  pick next year.
LeeSharpeNFL,"at what point is it correct to take lamar jackson out of this game?

his style seems more injury-prone than the average qb."

whale_capper,incase you missed it ... deep dive interview with  l assit week was a beauty... process discussion at 34:00 in was especially valuable:
whale_capper,sunk cost fallacy maybe? buy year 2 hoping to recoup loses for year 1? lots of things i dont understand about pick buying
whale_capper,i know a couple guys that hit that for the max but i dont want to spoil it if that comes to fruition
whale_capper,what a blast... two rounds of the group stage and all the knockouts le free throw  so the best is yet to come!
whale_capper,oh well make it interesting... id like to discuss that as part of an overall framing of how worldwide betting markets stack up
whale_capper,without barkley on the roster they probably wouldve had the #3 pick and couldve gotten the best player in this dra free throw
AndyMSFW,"new pinned tweet since whichever one i  daily fantasy sports  have up here i'll get asked to find:

AndyMSFW,i am n overtime a zoologist but it did say that it was a tail on the package from the crappy halloween store
AndyMSFW,"two minute periscope warning

AndyMSFW,that 1991 team was very good without checking i'm pretty sure they won the world series.  i mean how could they have not?
AndyMSFW,"hopefully someone saw this and said ""i  daily fantasy sports  think i have that at my book i'll just hit the over instead..."""
AndyMSFW,we soldier on.  despite this setback on the e assit co assit the  will still have a h overtime dog eating contest episode.
AndyMSFW,"as a semi-serious fan of the  the timeline is giving me some  points d tonight with all the ""cousins fucking sucks"" tweets. #nbafinals"
AndyMSFW,"well  that is  it for the nhl playoffs! america wins another cup 25 straight now.  maybe next year canada.
(and go islanders!)
#nhlplayoffs"
AndyMSFW,despite a late flourish the anthem went under.  2nd pitch of the game and we have a home run review. (clearly a dinger)
JoeyKnish22,pokerstars is the big one in nj and pennsylvania i would assume they open up in michigan at some  once this is official.
JoeyKnish22,somebody grab my phone and smash it on the ground before i bet another umass team total. youve g overtime like 7 minutes.
JoeyKnish22,theres some people who get upset about seeing people tweet appy state on this app that must be really extra tilted right now.
JoeyKnish22,if we play ohio state in one of those snow hurricanes you see on the discovery channel we might mightttt have a shot.
JoeyKnish22,"ben simmons 24-8-9 in a big home win vs the celts to start the year.

JoeyKnish22,first 4 responses were clemson! and i am telling you there is no way the committee is leaving out the defending undefeated champion.
JoeyKnish22,if you cant trust the self proclaimed mayor of a parking l overtime friends bartender who can you trust. im spending the money.
JoeyKnish22,only 19 and needs more club time this season. i dont think hes ready to carry you through a world cup qualifying campaign.
TheKostos,no shit. th against the spread the point. hes coaching scared when his team is n overtime as good. its baffling beyond belief
TheKostos,it is  insane that the steelers are 6-5. unreal coaching job by mike tomlin and kevin colbert killed it with the minkah trade
TheKostos,the refs gave the chargers about 15 extra seconds. that was insane. i  daily fantasy sports  think mike williams went out of bounds
TheKostos,so was yu darvish tipping his pitches in game 7 of the 2017 world series or were the scumbag assit ros cheating? #justiceforyu
TheKostos,maybe. again i  daily fantasy sports  claim to know the right answer. what i do believe is erring on the side of caution.
TheKostos,out of all the 90s wcw people in the news now sonny onoo has to be at the bottom of the likable list
TheKostos,all good man. n overtime necessary. just please rate/review/subscribe if you havent already and spread the word about the show. thank you kindly.

LockyLockerson,ok so i stepped away for about 15 minutes during the end of the early nba window...how on earth did the pacers cover?
LockyLockerson,ok rockets please  daily fantasy sports  do what you've done in every 2nd half for the l assit couple weeks.  thanks in advance.

EliHershkovich,zion can't win a ncaa title but he'll all of a sudden vault new orleans to that level. turn it down a notch.
EliHershkovich,ra point ors are now the favorites to win the e assit (+150) ahead of the bucks (+175). opened the playoffs at +225.
DannyParkins,and now he really doesn't. 3 straight bogeys. barring a miracle back 9 romo will be on the call for the bears game.
DannyParkins,good call by tessitore with the leveon bell comp on that montgomery run. also gotta love the rookie staying inbounds. savvy all around.
DannyParkins,and mitch is out along with all the offensive line starters by series 2. i continue to love how nagy handles this stuff.
DannyParkins,we already have a couple of times actually. giolito prob wont win al pitcher of the month (odorizzi) but the run is remarkable
DannyParkins,i love clelin ferrell so much as a pro prospect but i think the raiders are wildly incompetent so its quite a conundrum.

TheCousinSal,betting the no buzzer-beaters prop in the thursday/friday games couldnt have been easier this year. big congr against the spread to me. #marchmadness2019
TheCousinSal,i have to say  football is very exciting. and more so when like tonight they forget to play defense. # thursday night football
TheCousinSal,alvarez seems to be much more active this time in the early going. someone mustve told him i bet bigly on golovkin. #gggcanelo2
TheCousinSal,the falcons have 37 shots at the end zone and n overtime one play designed for julio jones?! talk about holding a grudge.
TheCousinSal,only draymond green can pluck an opponents eyeball out of his head and then stomp around in disbelief at the foul call. #cavswarriors
TheCousinSal,forget everything you learn at the summer hoops clinics kids. chris pauls clutch free throw almost just cost his team the series. #warriorsvsrockets
TheCousinSal,just now caught  retirement speech. dynamite job 82. you said all the right things. especially the part where you forg overtime to thank
TheCousinSal,i cant believe all these moves by the browns. in just one day they may have already doubled their win total from 2017!
TheCousinSal,the 6 seed is going to be 7-9 and will have a very good chance to upset the 3 seed (kc or jax)
TheCousinSal,i do. and it does not. explanation is that the change in temp. causes the alert. 67 degrees in la = chaos. #$grab

12Xpert,th against the spread n overtime what pareto says. the majority of profits come from a few very large stakers taking bad value.
12Xpert,you love  years old you are samples of size one that prove a theory. instead of trolling here go do some proper science.
12Xpert,if you are unable to have compassion for katie hopkins despite her visceral hatred towards others then youve missed the whole point. #headstogether
12Xpert,big teams will almost never be 3 so there's one problem to start with. sample will just be too small i would imagine.
12Xpert,a reminder that argumentum ad hominem is really the most distasteful way to debate and defend a point of view whilst critiquing anothers.
12Xpert,once per week usually sundays unless  it is  a grand slam then  it is  two weeks. basically a free throw er each tournament.
JambosPicks,the #braves lead the #n against the spread 3-0 a free throw er 5 handing o you are nationals (f5) play an l.
JambosPicks,o you are #laborday ends with a split: the   over 55 falls short but notre dame hangs on to cover the -17.5 spread.
JambosPicks,ok we've mentally recovered from the diamondbacks-rockies tragedy and still have five plays le free throw  on tonight's #mlb games.  let us  go!
mschwimer,i have literally n overtime heard a single reason from you. if so many are out there can you just name 1 please?
mschwimer,yes. this is more accurate. i am so used to saying subscribers. i need to do better and say registered users. thank you.
mschwimer,they have n overtime paid. o you are service has been free for everyone. today is very first day we asked for payment.
mschwimer,i explained where ed is wrong. again if a book would guarantee us $1m per bet then we would 100 percent  do that.
mschwimer,very interesting. im going to look at the 3-5 most prominent us books and see wh against the spread up. will report back.
mschwimer,all algorithm based. we have a full team of analysts working their asses off to build these models. they deserve all the credit.
mschwimer,it is  n overtime good that i genuinely  daily fantasy sports  know if donald trump made vern the ambassador of sweden or not.

RufusPeabody,in fairness it doesnt look like the edits always help jambos (though they seem to on the majority of those you posted)
RufusPeabody,i should have remembered that. jeff and i had dinner with both those guys that night. (see i can name drop too
RufusPeabody,which is how guys like mitch trubisky get taken #2 overall. i think arm strength is given too much weight by scouts.
RufusPeabody,how strongly you hold onto a prior should be proportional to the amount and quality of data that prior is based on.
RufusPeabody,he says he has documented records. you say  years old you are picks are verified by a top-10 nationally recognized accounting firm.
RufusPeabody,we dont post picks anymore though . but we do post ratings that you can use in  years old you are handicapping.
RufusPeabody,had an absolute bl assit recording this! i think we spent just as long talking off-air. thanks so much for having me
RufusPeabody,every tout that messages me tells me theyre part of the 1 percent  of touts that provide value. what are the odds?!
RufusPeabody,haha yep he's g overtime 17 top 5s since 2000 without a win but isn't an active pga to you are golfer.
RufusPeabody,betting tiger to win in each event and rolling it over is much better than the pr expected points added ckaged parlay
RufusPeabody,sometimes you have to realize  years old you are opinion isnt the most important in the world. (by you i mean me)
RufusPeabody,futures from preseason/early season. would n overtime have bet futures entering postseason. you'd be better off rolling over mls at that point.
RufusPeabody,that is  because you recommend betting $300/pick and -- here's the good part -- you release picks in markets with $250 limits!!
jeffma,latest and greatest episode of  where we dive into a  college football  championship post-mortem and have picks in all the nfl games

jeffma,"i think there is something wrong with questioning the integrity of a sport and an individual with no evidence beyond ""why not"""
jeffma,6 seconds le free throw  on sh overtime clock 30 some feet from hoop. i'd say risk is n overtime worth return
jeffma,"i think atlanta fell for the "" let us  do what g overtime us here"" and failed to really understand the situation"
jeffma,i'll be at the mit #ssac16 this weekend. ping me if you are interested in a cool job  working with awesome data
SportsCheetah,sorry ive been caught up in thanksgiving stuff with family and didnt even think to post before all of the games today.
SportsCheetah,i feel like continually running the ball on that drive is somewhere around n overtime taking a 2-for-1 down a bucket late.
SportsCheetah,i mean the qb knows the play and where his guys are going it isn't like he has to wait and look
SportsCheetah,"great coverage of the events from l assit night:

im riding with him: it was time for karl-anthony towns to fight back"
SportsCheetah,bump. 5 trips inside miami 20. 2 inside the 5. also bryce has to toss that thing out of bounds mercy man.
capjack2000,it'll be a race to see who reincarnates groovin. there are some in the media who might need therapy when that happens.
capjack2000,"yep. been dmd by many incarnations of him as well. 

if i didnt know better id think twitter was full of crackpots."
capjack2000,...and if you can get this done in the next month i might still be able to make thanksgiving at the gouker's.
capjack2000,dk sportsbook at scarlet pearl is n overtime part of kambiland. its what dk could be if theyd cut out the kancer.
capjack2000,th against the spread quite a delayed official launch. i remember watching nhl finals in that completed book a few months back.
capjack2000,yes. they run the sportsbooks at rhythm city and riverside. no they have n overtime launched a mobile app in iowa yet.
capjack2000,what about the 1st skin which was sold to betstars and the 3rd skin which was sold to dra free throw kings?
capjack2000,my long-running theory that pennsylvania cant get out of its own way just keeps perpetuating. hollywood casino in pa goes online with...
capjack2000,years old you are futures book has a 61 percent  vig! so what's it like to work at dra free throw kings?
dinkinc,none.  i would bet high on that. guy is loaded with st against the spread no one wants the public to hear
dinkinc,one should be better than the other. choose.  also it is a commonly used measure to catch up on a losing record
dinkinc,1-1 with a torture push on brewers over 9 for the  horses... even they had a hard time with that dead heat
dinkinc,i dislike thoughts and prayers but there are a l overtime of good people who use it... that statement is just unfair
dinkinc,another 12 ho you are very long day of poker where i will enter day 2 with an underwhelming amount of chips....
robpizzola,"it really doesn't negate ""a lot"" of that advantage. pretty hard to gain control of the puck when you're two men down."
robpizzola,would you say that rutgers is down on their knees today? do you think they can get up on their feet again?
robpizzola,no i played 49ers -3.5 -108 and if i needed to make a play at -5 i would still lean towards 49ers.
robpizzola,almost as crazy as someone buying  years old you are picks considering youve torched 69 bankrolls in the l assit calendar year
robpizzola,tv broadc assit is saying that dybala is out injured. looked like he hurt his fo overtime late in the first half.
robpizzola,yale being down only 12 with the way that this first half has gone is a pretty flattering scoreline for them imo
robpizzola,my goal is to beat betting markets. i've yet to find or build an expected goals model that consistently can do that.
RASPicks,ras  college football  totals 40-28 58.8 percent  l assit season 134-95 58.5 percent  l assit five years.   first release on wednesday.  .co/7biqrhwtyb
RASPicks,varies by sport play type book etc.  there are large betting groups who bet before o you are release in every market.
RASPicks,g overtime  years old you are lineups in?  get extra bonuses from top daily fantasy sites at .co/kn0iksbwow.  why sign-up anywhere else?
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  know nfl market well enough to answer that but i do think preseason is more beatable than regular season.
RASPicks,we use an average line between cris and pinn at time of post but they always move quickly.  have to be fast.

ProfessorShine,man could kellerman and smith whore themselves out more for disney?   smith would dress up like minnie mouse for the right price.
ProfessorShine,if the data is so good why would u sell it cheap?  years old you are business is selling picks.   good luck
ProfessorShine,of course limits much higher in nfl sides so maybe hes telling the truth.  the variance in nfl sides is obviously volatile
ProfessorShine,im busy capping tomm slate but it is both stupid  ignorant to think 1990 matters.  but hey doug has a new show.
suuma810,and pat shurm you are called a timeout before the two-minute warning so that he can open the drive with a run
suuma810,the #packers are on a 0-8 run on the road. their l assit road win was against the 0-16 browns in overtime.
suuma810,in fairness chiefs had 3  field goal s and a red zone pick in the first half when they couldn't really execute!
suuma810,mike smith told us that stopping the run is the number one priority for the #buccaneers defense. prior to the 2018 season.
suuma810,the #giants dra free throw ed a rb 2nd overall so that odell beckham can throw a deep touchdown pass to him.
ClevTA,its amazing. ppl cant comprehend it. they are so ingrained with what theyve been taught their whole life even though its incorrect
ClevTA,well th against the spread n overtime totally true. books do take a stand sometimes so they dont always want equal action
ClevTA,seems simple to me. only other explanation is it was all baker's doing to go f assit and he is covering up
ClevTA,when i used to constantly take texas tech overs in the 80s even then i never would imagine mahomes would become this
ClevTA,understandable but they were good l assit year too with the same personnel at 8th best pass coverage grade according to pff
ClevTA,quick  thursday night football  preview with some random matchup numbers. also my against the spread  pick in case you missed it earlier.
ClevTA,im never worried about future cap space. i mean they can cut brate who makes a lot. salary gymnastics arent a problem
CizzlingSports,"in his video today: espn is always looking for an opportunity to race-bait whenever they possible [can]

CizzlingSports,the drink-bleach part of all this  stuff is that he really dgaf; he's just pandering to and riling up his low-iq listeners/readers
CizzlingSports,"so it will be... what? one of those picks that arent really picks when they loose ?

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"""bo overtime and rally a free throw er the l assit 3 weeks"" moar accurate here jmac

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"this is a very po you are endorsement of cowherd skip nfl  nba vets coaches etc.

spanky,my chart is sexier than yours .  we compared out charts that one day at the bar.... we werent too far off...
spanky,"if i used cris and pinny to guide my bets id be broke.  

the screen is hit l assit n overtime first."
spanky,i believe this to be true for every form of betting.  there are talkers and there are bettors.  both sets rarely overlap
spanky,exactly.  i'm as sharp as a marble.   daily fantasy sports  know why bookmakers around the world either respect me or fear me
spanky,i g overtime a few funny looks but no one said anything to me... each entry is allowed to bring one guest
spanky,it takes a real proficient bookmaker to deal 07 and be profitable. canbet used to deal 07 until they became cantbet lol
spanky,it was the 3rd best o point ion right behind going out of bounds at the 10 or falling on the ball.
DocBettor,took some live under 272 -105 going into the 4th quarter for los angeles clippers / new orleans pelicans #lacvsnop #clippernation #wontbowdown
PlusEVAnalytics,so ridiculous.  must work on his obsession problem then go to a good old fashioned opera with a friend. chill francesco chill!
PlusEVAnalytics,a website that reviews kids toys according to how clear and easy to follow the assembly instructions are. theres a wide range.
PlusEVAnalytics,i think greed is the sym point om n overtime the disease. people respond to the incentives that the system gives them.
PlusEVAnalytics,r python machine learning etc - theyre all just tools. theres a reason it doesnt say fender stratocaster on the concert ticket.
PlusEVAnalytics,are those he point agon rims? jesus were really going for the something a sci-fi villain would drive aesthetic here arent we
PlusEVAnalytics,from a psychology perspective the karma bad beat refund thingy is a brilliant promotion. it means that every bet is live. kudos
PlusEVAnalytics,there are lots of valid criticisms of this but you need 300k roll in case you go 0-1000 is n overtime one.
PlusEVAnalytics,if their worst decision is worth -0.05 then their average decision cant be worth -0.05 unless every decision is worth -0.05 qed
PlusEVAnalytics,if the mound truly was the problem wouldnt ye royal grounds crew have been working their behinds off to fix it overnight?
PlusEVAnalytics,but if i had 500 results with 3 percent  roi on 5 percent  theoretical edge id be closer to 60 percent  kelly.
PlusEVAnalytics,were doing science here dont be imprecise. what does  years old you are best answer mean and how do you determine it?
PlusEVAnalytics,"there are frauds/scammers in every industry. the problem here is that its nearly impossible to tell who they are.
fooled by randomness."
PlusEVAnalytics,oh yeah the degens will totally consider the moral implications of supporting hypocrisy before they feed their welfare $ into these machines
PlusEVAnalytics,small play on under +106 in the rangers game today and mid sized play on under -115 in the dallas game tomorrow.

aluckyaday,apparently an arduino would be better o point ion than a pi. newer pis usb ports cant switch between slave and master.
aluckyaday,if you can't answer that question and more importantly brexiteers can n overtime agree on an answer then brexit can never happen.
aluckyaday,would they if there is a bias? by level staking aren't you over betting higher priced selections which would exaggerate any bias?
aluckyaday,"did n overtime get asked. just went in to ""my account"" and there is an o point ion there to switch plans."
aluckyaday,"actually is said ""following analysis of consultation responses we think that a reduction to 2 will reduce harm for the most vulnerable""."
aluckyaday,there may be room in the market for more than one model but their shareholders demand they run the most profitable one!
aluckyaday,daily fantasy sports  do that! i was reading timeline in reverse and saw new gc. thought  what the fuck  has happened now!
aluckyaday,"""a company that said that it was going to destroy the traditional bookmaker but that ended up being owned by one. """
aluckyaday,what can we expect from wout van aert in the tour? just there for the experience or will he be targeting anything?
aluckyaday,as you have n overtime given me enough information to determine if ab and c apply i'll have to go with d.
aluckyaday,n overtime o free throw en you tweet something i agree with. you just did and then you went and deleted it!
aluckyaday,"""this information will assist further in o point imising their risk adjusted expected return when setting odds and distributing the margin""   2/2"
aluckyaday,ahhhh variance and survivorship bias. tools of the trade! still waiting for this regression to the mean thing to kick in though
aluckyaday,someone should tell the editor of the pricewise page in the  that 188 no longer guarantee to hono you are pricewise prices
joeytunes2,i gave out baylor i gave out ohio. i'll give one more but  it is  hard to decide between alabama and cincinnati
joeytunes2,its al overtime of injury info. and running the ball lol. like i said in my tweet. wait and pounce. (tiger style)
joeytunes2,20  years ago. i was interviewed for the price is right. i didnt make the cut but very vocal in the audience.
joeytunes2,"winston's  arians: jameis winston (ankle) ""appears to be fine"". ""he will still be able to throw 5 interce point ions this week"""
joeytunes2,could you imagine having to get the police involved for any type of carter? are you even a man at that point?
joeytunes2,i put a chip in each of the division one athletes head. then i control them with an old atari joy stick.
joeytunes2,betting on the heisman is terrible value no matter what. the hold percent  is insane.  that is  why they dont offer no's
joeytunes2,anyone want oregon gear. and my tattoo? everything must go! so i guess  it is  back to years of 7 and 9.
joeytunes2,"colombia should have lost that game. 2 goals from the chile were taken away.
an offsides and a hand ball. they dominated."
joeytunes2,just ate some tacos de carne con   pleasure was all his... give him a follow smart guy. standing up for the bettor.
joeyisaks,ok since will power g overtime wrongly penalized for hitting a crew guy im now jumpin on board and rootin for ed!
joeyisaks,it was cantors that ke point  rejected my tennis bets l assit year n overtime jeff so all is fine here ha
EdMillerPoker,in-play football (esp college) during the 2021 season will be a v opportunity imo. v enough id start learning the ropes now.
EdMillerPoker,i know. just interesting to me how that quirk of reporting defines how the industry (and bettors) tend to think about parlays.
EdMillerPoker,"what does the second sentence mean? in what way did they or anyone for that matter ""choose"" the ""scri point ing privilege""?"
EdMillerPoker,n overtime gonna be irrelevant to all the people lighting money on fire backing dubious ventures reliant on this faulty analogy imo
EdMillerPoker,dont know probably i dont want to know their names the ppl who try to make a name for themselves this way
EdMillerPoker,a good political argument i guess is one that makes you forget for a second that someones naked self-interest is behind it
EdMillerPoker,in general would expect parlays to be more popular on avg in places without mobile due to increased friction to place bets
EdMillerPoker,the flexible thing is key. signing a long-term contract with a single operator almost has to be wrong from the state's perspective.
EdMillerPoker,prediction: the 6 ppl who arent broke by tomorrow a free throw ernoon all go all in on saints -21.5 alt spread
GolcondaFund,"and no singletary.
bills cann overtime run against bungals like 49ers did with gore.

GolcondaFund,n overtime high on texans o-line but watson looks composed eyes down field feels pocket well runs and is fearless. bright future.
nonrandomalpha,at le assit th against the spread how im currently thinking of its potential applicability...could use some work. happy to hear feedback.
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah. try to focus on process over outcome of course but that doesn't mean emotions aren't real. thanks for the kind words.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the  2020 opponents are officially determined:

det x2 gb x2  minutes x2
atl car no tb
hou ind jax ten
lar nyg"
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah i just never added that level of granularity to the model. it doesn't come up until around well week 16 :p
LeeSharpeNFL,but you're making more regular season games less exciting (because teams will have little to play for sooner in the regular season).
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah i realized that a free throw er i tweeted because i am a dummy who didn't read the full thread context.
LeeSharpeNFL,you seem to think belichick benefits more from having brady than brady does from having belichick. i definitely would say the opposite.
LeeSharpeNFL,these were all on 3rd downs i ran out of room in the text unfortunately but it was on the chart title.
LeeSharpeNFL,agreed. but i  daily fantasy sports  *know* if the bet is + expected value because this additional factor isn't in the model.
LeeSharpeNFL,believe it or n overtime nagy has only lost one game by more than one score (this year week 7 vs. no)
LeeSharpeNFL,if you look at the body of work for both i think trubisky  daniel but certainly daniel has been better in 2019.
whale_capper,just listened to the  podcast where they explained it and it sounded super promising going to keep a close eye on it
whale_capper,while im sure this applies across sports the small sample size blowing up the uncertainty for rsw in football is wildly underpriced
whale_capper,reasonable to expect hell be less than his standard contribution regardless and will be surprised if he sees any crunch time minutes
AndyMSFW,they certainly aren't married to those numbers if a few people start hitting em right away in the a free throw ernoon
AndyMSFW,rams-49ers game a few years back on  thursday night football ; i took rams -2.5 and  took the  moneyline on the 49ers.
AndyMSFW,made a new spreadsheet for the new season of basketball.  including bonus (real sketchy) pick for tonight that i forg overtime about:
AndyMSFW,"i  daily fantasy sports  bet a ton of college football but i remember saying ""i wish i had grabbed that navy +10"""
AndyMSFW,"the ""pretending to go for it on 4th to draw them offsides"" play has the same success rate as coaches challenging pi"
AndyMSFW,since this game sucks here's a bonus photo of me trying to figure out green screen from earlier. # thursday night football
AndyMSFW,well it appears you're working with some ryegrass there maybe some fine fescue...  scoffs at that with his plush vibrant kentucky bluegrass
AndyMSFW,massive swings in the  field goal  and 2h spreads on a couple of 2 point  tries... this has been a fun one
AndyMSFW,listen to what todd says (about this at least) and also read this article. you'll be a tad smarter on monday morning.
AndyMSFW,"played a couple small 3-ball bets for the  1st round:

glover +135 over taylor/hossler
kang +210 over tway/grillo
blixt +200 over snedeker/stroud"
AndyMSFW,0.0000124 percent  chance without adjusting for the dh or barometric pressure based on roughly 217000 games 18 four-dinger games and 325 cycles.
AndyMSFW,"early #pgachampionship play:

no hole in one -110

just gotta sweat roughly 450 tee shots on the 14th hole over 4 days"
JoeyKnish22,also through 2 games grier looked like a welfare version of nathan peternan so kyle allen looks like dan marino right now.
JoeyKnish22,think its located outside where the security guards typically toss ppl out at. placed it there for a so free throw  landing.
JoeyKnish22,this isnt a fucking u12 little league h overtime dog contest johnny. this is the big leagues where uncle k reigns supreme.
JoeyKnish22,max hasnt been ahead of a line move since the internet started doug. so youre discussing this topic with the wrong guy.
JoeyKnish22,darren i hear the gentleman behind this ticket are n overtime only sharp but also quite handsome and charming. can you confirm?
JoeyKnish22,gonna be driving around downtown in january with a case of malt liquor picking up crackheads having them open accounts for me.
JoeyKnish22,if youre available in detroit on thursday i hear theyre having tryouts downtown wednesday. real chance to play in an nfl game!
JoeyKnish22,under 51 (large). over 45. akron running hurry up for a garbage time  touchdown  against emu walk ons to kill the middle
JoeyKnish22,they still might win/cover this game. but multiple people told me this week usf had turned the corner and was trending up......
JoeyKnish22,+300 is too high. hell be going against elite competition who should be better pr expected points added red for his tactics.
JoeyKnish22,lost control of the game and no de point h means weve brought on shitty players. only a matter of time now.
TheKostos,i mute people who tweet dumb shit at me. he can have conversations with himself in my mentions all he wa  touchdown
TheKostos,we just had an unreal interview with  on  i do n overtime say that lightly. you will laugh. i guarantee it. #mfer
TheKostos,"i'm far from a coach but i think purdue punting here is absolutely the right move

(also i have the 1q under)"
TheKostos,hawks and pelicans for sure. also like pistons. jazz look like a great sp overtime but the pf there is high lol.
TheKostos,i just lost money on that fight and cant help marking out for tyson fury. that my friends is a quality performer.
TheKostos,capped tonight's nba card and i've currently g overtime five sides i like. can't wait to go through it from 6-7pm et
TheKostos,juwan would have made those  free throw s though. that ain't coaching. kids gotta sack up and drain some  free throw s
TheKostos,pretty badass that i went to sleep watching the australian open and  it is  still on while i have my morning coffee
TheKostos,carroll is undoubtedly a legendary figure in the game but hes lost his fastball and anyone arguing differently just isnt paying attention
LockyLockerson,whatever the pelicans didn't do the jazz did in the final 3 minutes there.  have n overtime one clue how they covered.
LockyLockerson,mariota and derrick henry frequently in the backfield at the same time but cant think of 3 players in a formation ever.
LockyLockerson,basically the colts are scoring and then choosing how theyd like to gi free throw  the steelers points for the entire game.
LockyLockerson,when was the l assit time a player won the heisman in a year where they missed a regular season game entirely?
LockyLockerson,you could also just (for  years old you are sanity) avoid betting those too.  then you just get to watch my insanity.
LockyLockerson,considering my son woke up at 5:15am kickoff tonight still seems like a ways away.  but its n overtime that far.  wooooooooooooooooo
LockyLockerson,only playstation vue could increase rates so much in the l assit 2 years that i'd think about going back to cable.

kellyinvegas,b/r betting mailbag :  is answering all  years old you are  college football  and nfl betting questions in the comments right now
kellyinvegas,mine is week 1-17. the play with the line and how much my bet was. th against the spread it. very simplistic
kellyinvegas,kimzey is my fav bull rider. need to keep my bias out of it. but at $10 a card this could fun

ToddFuhrman,the over under for tomorrow's  college basketball  game between navy and uva opened at 97... it is  the anti oklahoma vs lsu
ToddFuhrman,"this save given the time and situation was absolutely incredible.

(also shame on the scoreboard operator for having no faith in flower)"
ToddFuhrman,as we recorded this  podcast i was thinking one loyal listener is going to absolutely love that his game made the cut...

TheCousinSal,"longest touchdown over prop (49.5 yards for indy/tennessee) is now 9-2 since we mentioned on against all odds podcast.  
youre

welcome!"
TheCousinSal,i think if drew brees gets 6 or 7 more chances he may be able to cut this deficit to a touchdown.
TheCousinSal,my cousin  and i have been practicing an emmy-winning celebration should  pull the upset. here it is. were open to suggestions.  #fingerscrossed
TheCousinSal,three years off and still as relentless a son of a bitch as youll find in the octagon.  good job by you
TheCousinSal,and so marks the first time new york fans have cheered a dra free throw  pick since 1853. congr against the spread
TheCousinSal,the ravens offensive play-calling suggests that they currently have enough points to win this game. i for one dont think they do.
TheCousinSal,its been a long day. can we please forego  overtime and award each team a tie? neither of them deserves better. #dalvshou
TheCousinSal,something tells me the post-game conor mcgregor getup isnt going to be nearly as funny tonight. i take it back...even funnier! #fitztragic
TheCousinSal,who are we kidding? the browns will lose (and blow the cover) by 6 in ot.  but lets all watch anyway. #pitvscle
TheCousinSal,chose to watch grease 2 for the 1798th time in my life over red sox/yankees and couldnt be happier with my decision.
TheCousinSal,"i love love love marcell ateman the raiders 7th round pick...just n overtime in that spot. #tryingtosoundsmart

TheCousinSal,if you bet over 3750.5 challenges in the l assit 2 minutes of this celtics/lakers game youre in excellent shape right now.
TheCousinSal,jerry jones was just reminded for an ho you are of how bad the eagles were and said yep...lets make it official.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  offer tables week by week but technically you can construct them yourself fairly quickly if you're handy with excel.
12Xpert,any xg modellers i'd be interested to know what the xg was for salah's converted chance. michael owen reckons it was 0.01.
12Xpert,"but equally you could say ""what happens if we then also take brian clough out (1993)"". then it drops back to 12."
12Xpert,no they are when i collect the odds (typically friday a free throw ernoon for weekend games tuesday morning for midweek games).
12Xpert,"weekend woc matches available:

a free throw er reims victory away at psg midweek record is now marginally ahead of expectation again."
12Xpert,"extra leagues weekend results data added.

main leagues midweek fixtures available (england  spain).

12Xpert,yes i suppose so. what im actually looking at is the spread of means. i originally made the distinction in this article.

mschwimer,if you can tell me what time the top screen sh overtime was taken i will be able to explain what happened.
mschwimer,and as everyone on this chain has pointed out. i have a longggg way to go. but that is why im here!
mschwimer,its 17 weeks and includes nfl mlb  college football  and  college basketball . please read the material. literally on the front page.
mschwimer,easy answer. we already have the money. we would never acce point  anymore subscribers than we can pay out if we lose.
mschwimer,this is how vegas does it. n overtime nj. look on my feed. a follower posted the rule directly from the site.
mschwimer,if you are serious about baseball and want the best glove possible.  go to .co/ggdamichwj and read up.  this is no joke
mschwimer,nice... unfortunately too far for me to drive... but good luck... u need to get  you are ass in the top 35
mschwimer,haha u r on  you are way.  maybe if u hit the weight room with the panthers you would get there faster
RufusPeabody,if youre the seahawks would you rather lose tonight and play at philly or win the division and host the vikings?
RufusPeabody,yes very different. i  daily fantasy sports  care about explaining effect on winning that game. i care about predicting future games.
RufusPeabody,kids dont buy the half-point onto an nfl total and definitely n overtime onto 48 (half-point there worth about 5 cents)
RufusPeabody,additionally the terms of service provide for arbitration to decide any disputes and do n overtime allow for class action lawsuits.
RufusPeabody,"which is more likely to occur:
(a) romo wins byron nelson
(b) romo struck by lightning during week of byron nelson"
RufusPeabody,was waiting for this. yass railing against wire act. obviously this needs to disappear for an exchange to really take off.
RufusPeabody,waiting and n overtime getting it later causes you to n overtime have a chance to make up for it though.
jeffma,yeah. three or fo you are times. i really like it but it does get mixed reviews. it is really expensive
jeffma,congr against the spread to  for nailing gary woodland as a long sh overtime with value in the us open #blindsquirrel
jeffma,i think tua +$ is value. still think he should be the favorite. n overtime sure i understand the market here
jeffma,sorry josh didn't realize that was  years old you are bag. should have known from the blue velo you are vest
jeffma,this is what happens when you go to din tai fung alone.  daily fantasy sports  worry i killed all the xlb
SportsCheetah,mercy perkins was sacked three times and the coverage was perfect th against the spread an insane  touchdown  pitch and catch.
SportsCheetah,no it isnt if they dont meet requirement for games played or finish season etc. theyre no action win or lose.
SportsCheetah,while everyone stopped and lou was standing by himself on the other end of the court for a wide-open go-ahead 3
SportsCheetah,dont they have all the momentum on that play still there? theyd be an underdog in  overtime about 50/50 in regulation.
SportsCheetah,"- 

if eddie house played in the 50s there would be eddie house statues in every capital in the united states."
SportsCheetah,6 final 3:07 of the half so better # at hal free throw ime if youre into that sort of thing.
SportsCheetah,just saw this from nfl next gen stats: baker mayfield is 1-for-21 passing on scramble rollouts to the right this season.
SportsCheetah,"the nuggets sh overtime 16/49 (32.7 percent ) on 2-pointers tonight from an average of 7.7-feet out. 

hassan whiteside runaway dpoy?"
SportsCheetah,he was hurt in the preseason but dont think its too bad. n overtime sure if its injury related or not.
SportsCheetah,brk u44.5 -120 - this + 40m on dj + no kd + kyrie averaging 63 games played per season anyway
capjack2000,this pic of the crowd watching the first legal sports bet being made in new hampshire pretty much sums it up.
capjack2000,dania is way better...and neither stocks $100 bills in their cashout kiosks. th against the spread how low-roller these places are.
capjack2000,i agree.  for what  it is  worth  i believe the nfl deals do n overtime include logo usage for betting purposes.
capjack2000,"in 1965 ralph nader published his landmark book unsafe at any speed. 

in 2019 ralph nader could write an appropriate sequel:"
capjack2000,"wow...just wow. regulators need better counsel. 

"" daily fantasy sports  stand in the doorway  daily fantasy sports  block up the hall."""
capjack2000,fair point. however what if wh were to add an online casino to their mobile product in states where they can?
capjack2000,are you sure you're looking at playmgm nj?  the nv playmgm app is igt. the nj app is gvc's stadium product.
capjack2000,for a single retail bookmaker its probably tougher than taking a position and trying to ally themselves with the sharp side.
capjack2000,votes are in. majority thinks itll come later. ill rerun this for aug/se point /oct if necessary. (aug is my bet)
capjack2000,"brian musberger on sports betting media : you cant bullshit this audience. these people want to know if youre authentic.

#bosamerica"
capjack2000,theyre also going to keep their logo on the green monster to 3 x 3 to reflect their sportsbook market share.
capjack2000,this is especially true of derivative bets. limits cut down to $150 arent uncommon. still much better than most euros though.
capjack2000,n overtime sure why nj hasnt permitted aaf betting yet. theyre literally missing out on tens of dollars of tax revenue.
dinkinc,had fun meeting with   and mrs ca point ain jack l assit night.  both were as nice as can be ..
dinkinc,that match should get at le assit 4 3/4 stars. aew should be calling jake right a free throw er breakfast
dinkinc,he goes by his own rules... he has no idea about the rules of racing... or how to spell most states....
robpizzola,i am likely going away for new years but if i am in town i will try to make it downtown
robpizzola,someone on the packers defense was yelling screen as that play was starting as if they knew exactly what was coming.
robpizzola,the best part about today is that there arent enough late games for me to lose all of my money back.
robpizzola,lots of studies done on why you shouldnt trade up in the dra free throw . im n overtime the idiot.
robpizzola,"first glance bangers:

robpizzola,i cant imagine being a neutral hockey fan and rooting for any scenario where we have to watch more avalanche games.

RASPicks,i usually post at .co/lijtncycek a bit before tweet competing with 14k+ people and i am sure some books follow too.
RASPicks,we've released an average of 70 free picks (actually + expected value ones) per year over the l assit 3 years.
RASPicks,doesn't make much sense.   college football  is a big market if we make a bad play the market will correct itself.
RASPicks,yes historically the plays have still been profitable even at the close but profits would be cut by more than half.
RASPicks,pretty much everywhere onscreen and about 70 percent  of offscreens.  we released it within an ho you are of start time.

ProfessorShine,he wanted temple to drop to d2 and i vehemently disagreed but most of his other stuff were great to read
ProfessorShine,oh i know mich isnt gonna get them.  but a free throw er what i watched flo-socarol im a little sensitive
ProfessorShine,but sports books and sports book marketing people told me sports betting is the same as the investment industry. so confusing
ProfessorShine,in  college basketball  its always been if its close its a goaltend.  hope this isnt decided by 2-4 points oregons way
ProfessorShine,or writing a book promising to win money vs writing a book that educates in probability and the sports betting market.

suuma810,oh for sure. their season largely depends on the delta in offensive improvement but their schedule could propel them a lot.
suuma810,incase you missed it : my team preview for the baltimore #ravens along with a pick on their season win total
suuma810,nein ganz klar zu teuer.  gibt noch eine komponente leadership die mmn eine rolle spielt. evtl. war das noch ein grund.
suuma810,no but there also isn't a better lt on their roster who i know. they can still find a new starter.
suuma810,they still scored a  touchdown  on that drive. boys were clearly the better team and should have won in regulation already.
suuma810,this weeks #nfl board is odd. 12 games lined around key numbers 3 7 and 10. lots of strong line moves.
ClevTA,his head was touched before he hit the ground and way before his hand went oob. glad it didnt cost me
ClevTA,but i'm sick of giving out good matchup st against the spread for chubb and then he's off the field so...
ClevTA,nothing bothers me more about the iphone 11 than the fact the battery  percent  doesnt show anymore. what a fatal flaw
ClevTA,darius slayton can have a goosegg or go for 100+ and multiple  touchdown s today. he's the ultimate dart throw imo
CizzlingSports,you can see the running total of units won/lost here since the start of the 17-week program. -12.19u was on 9/20/19
CizzlingSports,"ive had two straight loosing weeks. but i feel a bounce back!

CizzlingSports,lots going on here but the point as usual is to remember that this man  wants to sell you gambooling pickz
CizzlingSports,fun is when  started hiding long-term records behind a pay wall at the start of the 2019-20 nfl season because well....
spanky,no im saying if we are going to bet the over and the line is 41.5 id buy through to o40.5-130
spanky,gotta love billys tenacity.  he hates to lose and would do everything he could to take the l off his record...
spanky,th against the spread pretty monsterous on a game where baltimore was favored by 3 even with a back up qb
spanky,kicking out customers who never even set fo overtime in the joint for undesirable behavior aint a good look either for
spanky,disagree buddy. theyve had wayyyyyyy more than their fair share the l assit 15 years between the patriots and red sox.

DocBettor,nba live prop bet on portland trail blazers / los angeles lakers winning margin 5 or less -112 #porvslal #ripcity #lakeshow
DocBettor,closing line value is important for sports betting. is there a different / more specific metric for live in-game wagering? #gamblingtwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,hmm if you had access to a closing line value market you could have won before the games even kick off...
PlusEVAnalytics,go back 5 years in a time machine and tell someone clayton keyshaw is pitching today and the total is 12.5
PlusEVAnalytics,daily fantasy sports  is way harder for a casual bettor to beat than sports betting. higher vig + more sophisticated opponents.
PlusEVAnalytics,anyone disappointed that  is n overtime posting winning 1p picks today its all good - im still posting my losing ones!
PlusEVAnalytics,im back! under +105 on the rangers game and under +103 on edmonton/arizona - i have both around +6 percent  edge.
PlusEVAnalytics,lol how? i cant imagine there would be much overlap between projecting a minor leaguers career path and beating betting markets.
PlusEVAnalytics,the markets appear efficient is a logical fallacy. any efficiency if one were to exist would likely be invisible to you.
aluckyaday,you  daily fantasy sports  need machine learning to do the 2030s model random picks will do it. survivorship bias is king!
aluckyaday,going on just my twitter feed it is impossible to understand how the tories are so far ahead in the polls
aluckyaday,how do they calculate the insurebet price? are they just using standard each way terms or do they remove the filth?
aluckyaday,i think the eu have the same view as me. boris is bluffing. an extension and a general election/referendum are coming.
aluckyaday,do the existing casinos automatically get a licence to operate a sports book on their property? and online within the state?
aluckyaday,isn't this an issue with elo. in the early stages of a career it is more dependent on opportunity than ability?

joeytunes2,i know for a fact we ate 30x i paid 2x. i'm either cheap or  years old you are generous haha
joeytunes2,i feel like orlando is the right side of nba. n overtime posting it as a play. just dropping some knowledge.
joeyisaks,theres also the o point ion to politely ask the person to n overtime recline and explain why it bothers you..
joeyisaks,wh against the spread  years old you are little women line it could still be good. its good up to -200
joeyisaks,i spent 3 weeks in india it took years off my life expectancy and had nothin to do with red meet

EdMillerPoker,nah its n overtime specific to that guy or his business. if its n overtime him itll be the next guy.
EdMillerPoker,caucus is quite the euphemism. they should call it spend half a day at an elementary school sitting in tiny chairs

EdMillerPoker,my wife and i g overtime season tix when las vegas g overtime a team. was a l overtime of fun.
EdMillerPoker,think alun is mostly right. large number of americans know almost zilch about europe and also have no problem with that.
EdMillerPoker,dont know if they would bother but theyre uniquely situated to both obliterate competition and add substantial value to the industry
EdMillerPoker,snarky sports analtyics bro takes on trade/roster/contract moves these days are like 90 percent  airballs. maybe just  daily fantasy sports  anymore?

EdMillerPoker,yeah i'm interested in this stuff tho currently do n overtime make enough time for myself to dig into it enough
GolcondaFund,"this is unprecedentedly bad.
any player over 60 on madden rating is going to quit on this team. so maybe 5?"
GolcondaFund,nfl 2016 / 17 teams ended the year with a total  points  differential of -2 to 2.2 #anygivensunday  value. position. opportunity.
nonrandomalpha,this is actually false. using the same analogy finding suitable or superior alternatives has forced the price of oil secularly lower.
nonrandomalpha,i work in the city and usually dont leave the office until a free throw er the game is already over
nonrandomalpha,this is why college sports are far more meaningful and substantively emotive. loyalty is real and connected via experience and education.
nonrandomalpha,why texans tho? more like cards. public pounding a bad team on the road. lead these squares to the chopping block.
nonrandomalpha,its just lazy analysis to call them out when they do provide a decent service for those that want that service...
LeeSharpeNFL,"matt nagy's record vs. nfc north rivals:

4-0 vs. lions

LeeSharpeNFL,i actually really want to watch o you are cpoe lord and savior ryan tannehill take on the patriots defense now.
LeeSharpeNFL,fun fact: it would be great it the current score in all of the games right now was the final score.
LeeSharpeNFL,"vikings are up 1 point at hal free throw ime with a +3 turnover margin.

 that is .... n overtime great."
LeeSharpeNFL,"le free throw  image: my facebook cover photo at this time l assit year.

right image: my current facebook cover photo."
LeeSharpeNFL,"no longer requires cle to win either.

this is real. i'd rather have ten in though. playoffs tannehill would be sweet."
LeeSharpeNFL,this doesn't seem wrong to me? there wasn't much time le free throw . a touchdown drive there isn't super likely.
LeeSharpeNFL,thst is true. though this is an objective question at least. i  daily fantasy sports  like reviewing subjective stuff at all.
LeeSharpeNFL,i must confess to have never using whatsapp. i mostly use facebook messenger or old-fashioned text messages like a privacy-agnostic sucker.
LeeSharpeNFL,this is only mean acceleration at the time of the handoff (across plays) n overtime at each moment within a play.
LeeSharpeNFL,"if these immature ""lmaooooo"" tweets wht you guys want to do feel free but take it out of my mentions. thanks."
LeeSharpeNFL,just woke up!  it is  only annoying when there's a 6:30 london game for  years old you are team or something.
LeeSharpeNFL,note: there was a bug with homefield in l assit version. fixed in the above tweet. apologies for the error. :(
LeeSharpeNFL,go with python if you already know it!  has a good guide to getting started in python see his pinned tweet.

whale_capper,this was before no beat ind sf now up 3 games on sea in potential strength of victory tiebreaker i believe...
whale_capper,to avoid confusion... truly impressive to see how this has blown up and think you guys have something great growing here
whale_capper,imagine if there were an nfl handicapping show that you could watch and comment on live... great news there is one:
whale_capper,i thought it was fair... know there was some talk among the players of fading the overlay on 1 and 6
whale_capper,seemingly impossible... lafluer constantly running when he shouldnt and then n overtime running in any goal to go situation was bizarre
whale_capper,very true but the goff comp is tricky because as the no. 1 overall pick the talent level was presumably there
whale_capper,good to hear a dissenting opinion rams certainly have the weapons in the passing game to come back from any deficit
whale_capper,what does it look like if we change the y-axis to deviation from the team total implied by the closing spread/total?
whale_capper,this was good but kerr should know kds killsh overtime is about 4  free throw  to the le free throw ...
whale_capper,i think he thought that also and blew off some teams in the bottom half that will now pass on him
AndyMSFW,didn't have any plays for  college basketball  today but there's a fat slate for tomorrow i'll certainly have a few plays.
AndyMSFW,has this been in  years old you are dra free throw s for 5 years?  no chance he's less than 40
AndyMSFW,yes but l assit year's model was only really used for conference play... so there's really no telling what could happen.
AndyMSFW,technically a two horse exacta box is a quinella for anyone familiar with the sigma derby at the d on fremont.
AndyMSFW,yeah the worst case game state is probably oakland getting out to a lead early and using an efficient run attack.
AndyMSFW,"with the third pick in the 2019 home run derby pool myself and  (of  select josh bell.  
 is on the clock!"
AndyMSFW,yeah i played them smaller essentially spending all my futures winnings if they all lost.  was nice to come out ahead.
AndyMSFW,my 2019 golf roi is 27.8 percent  i feel like there is only one direction that it can go from here.
AndyMSFW,"yankees - red sox

JoeyKnish22,this would be funnier if i didnt have a bet on shanny coy that might have just went up in flames.
JoeyKnish22,couldnt ask for a better sp overtime needing a backdoor  touchdown  to hit this middle than having this army passing offense.
JoeyKnish22,no. if he could mike williams woulda had a walk in  touchdown  and they coulda saved this play for later lol.

JoeyKnish22,3 minutes into the season and if the broncos drop one more pass it will be first tilt of the season.

DannyParkins,the bears are only down 9 and theres so much time le free throw  in this game but it feels over.
DannyParkins,kirby smart needs to respect his gambling public more than that  field goal  to go up 13 on 4th and inches.

Gingfacekillah,i dont have the answer for that readily on hand at the moment. im experimenting with a more player specific approach.
Gingfacekillah,yes. pacific division is wide open with a number of floundering teams. hitchcock's low support breakout system should help them capitalize.

TheCousinSal,incredible game. its a shame it had to end in ohio st. miscommunication. they should leave that stuff to the refs.
TheCousinSal,for some reason deshaun watson is 100x better at throwing a 50 yd fly pattern than a 6 yard curl route.
TheCousinSal,heres eli finding out he was benched...or witnessing his brother winning another super bowl...or watching his wife give birth...hard to tell.
TheCousinSal,ugh...drake is annoying me so much right now. i know hes n overtime at this game. just putting it out there.
TheCousinSal,so far nick nurses hal free throw ime plan to go scoreless in the 3rd quarter is n overtime paying dividends.
TheCousinSal,the san jose sharks have n overtime won a game in like 4 days. refs had better get their acts together.
TheCousinSal,will someone please push me off a bridge before boston completes this chowder slam or whatever the eff they call it?
TheCousinSal,hey ravens/chargers...you realize youre the only game on tv right now - dont you?  try n overtime to be so boring.
TheCousinSal,i get it though. marcus smart has been a force in this league for 15 years. he deserves the close calls.
TheCousinSal,g overtime 10 seconds? my week 17 best bets delivered to you in the time it takes the ball to drop
TheCousinSal,l assit week the degenerate  trifectas  nailed his college $ line parlay. todays 6 teamer...okla aub minn utah cfla purdue +244

TheCousinSal,if you're a #mets batter with only one  ho you are tonight - you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. #lgm #therouteison
TheCousinSal,undertaker/reigns match was weird. i'd bet anything ( probably lose as usual) that it wasn't supposed to end that way. #wrestlemania
TheCousinSal,once again the bloated blowhard is way off the mark. the to you are bus bit was 100 percent  legit. #happyfattuesday
TheCousinSal,wow - incredible ending. kyle shanahan's play calling with 3 minutes le free throw  proves he's ready for the 49ers. #superbowl2017
TheCousinSal,p against the spread have sb experience all time great qb/coach defense + spread still won't move off -3?anyone else suspicious?!#riggedline
TheCousinSal,very impressive - but sadly this is going to go down as a top 10 mike trout highlight. it should not.
TheCousinSal,parasite was good but i felt like 1917 should've won best picture since  that is  precisely when this telec assit began.
TheCousinSal,hey  - why do i get the feeling that  is about to bet $30 million to win $54 million on parasite?
TheCousinSal,i have it 2-2 a free throw er 4.  reyes gassing a little but still very close. jones -175 live on
TheCousinSal,however theres no evidence of clear recovery...aside from the clear video evidence that there was an immediate recovery.  replay rules suck.
12Xpert,if the market was fully efficient the blue line slope would be 1 and the orange line slope would be 0.
12Xpert,the actual electorate on 12th december should be big enough which is when the wavefunction collapses and one reality is observed.
12Xpert,its n overtime something i would do but i respect peoples right to do it. i wouldnt take it to heart.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  normally follow such thing but i suspect this one is going to be a l overtime of fun.

JambosPicks,#reds-#marlins is a 4-0 game a free throw er 5 which means o you are under 4 (f5) play is a...
JambosPicks,#cubs: o you are model liked you on the  moneyline tonight and you're giving up rbi hits to the #phillies pitcher?!
mschwimer,because eventually they could bet before release and move lines which would n overtime be benificial to o you are subscribers.
mschwimer,plays from 2/12 on are all verifiable. th against the spread 6 months worth of playing the majority of the cards.
mschwimer,a l overtime of people can call me a l overtime of things. but a liar certainly isnt one of them.
mschwimer,you can see for yourself! go to . o you are full mlb record is on a single page. please review!

mschwimer,derrick rose was  all night. sooooo much fun to wake up to that performance on my dvr.  performance that transcends sports.
mschwimer,it feels great to be the champ.  as i always told you clowns the cream will always rise to the top!
mschwimer,just want to make sure u heard it here first. also look for cleveland to acquire kevin love in a trade
mschwimer,that is the worst tweet iv seen... im upset i even clicked on that link... i should unfollow u for that
mschwimer,if u have time can u help me with the trivia question i just posted... the iron pigs r very curious
RufusPeabody,also can someone tell me how to post snippets of spreadsheets in a tweet? i am clearly behind the times.
RufusPeabody,for me  it is  an issue of incentives. so yes i believe co-investing is a better model than selling picks.
RufusPeabody,im trying n overtime to jump to conclusions regarding purpose of the policy. but the effect is i believe predatory.
RufusPeabody,that is  n overtime surprising. but with few exce point ions they post a limit and that applies to everyone.
RufusPeabody,fair point. i just saw it as a good opportunity to make a more general point about the pick-selling model.
jeffma,so can we agree the dolphins peaked somewhere between 15-35 percent  to win the afc east? does that equal might?
jeffma,if you are an immigrant you will love this book... if you aren't you will love this book... get it!
jeffma,have you rewatched that play? it was hardly an egregious no call.  years old you are process missed a layup
jeffma,take  years old you are super bowl win and  years old you are future nba titles and be happy :)
jeffma,may i take this opportunity to remind you how dumb it is that we only have a 4 team playoff?
jeffma,i agree with him that we ti point oed around a l overtime of subjects regarding gill and marco etc
jeffma,i am n overtime talking about u. i have no idea who u are or if u have missed anything
jeffma,if you haven't watched #biglittlelies do n overtime go to this moment. instead watch the 7 episodes. it is amazing
jeffma,just seems like a small sample size that isn't stable over time. conce point ually makes sense just hate trends
jeffma,blue jays fans g overtime to feel good about their season hanging in the balance with liriano on the hill
jeffma,a l overtime is true but a l overtime is made up also. the book is a bit more accurate.
SportsCheetah,hmmm im down there at ph a few times a week but never tried it. ill give it a go.
SportsCheetah,tom out here hustling like we didnt watch him scramble for 17 yards on 4th and 6 the other night.
SportsCheetah,n overtime sure about that kyle. 4 yards. and 8 points isnt even a lock to tie with one possession.
SportsCheetah,just uga +7.5 we banked on daily wager but le free throw  it off article since it went to 7.
SportsCheetah,this is one of matts worst takes. ill think about mine. i never eat/use cranberry sauce so its probably that.
SportsCheetah,luka doncic and lebron james now the only players under 21 years of age to score 40+ in a triple-double.
SportsCheetah,i didnt bet this one  for what  it is  worth  but i would get some at +3 if it shows
SportsCheetah,yeah would rather eat rice for the rest of my life than bet umass but 41.5 that hook was calling
SportsCheetah,a rather scoreless development in los angeles as they moved zubac to the bench so harrell could start with lou.
SportsCheetah,right which sounded like you were trying to make a case for clemson based on  years old you are tweet
SportsCheetah,goffs 68 passing attem points  will be tied for the third-most in a game in nfl history (bledsoe 70 1994).
capjack2000,no way. the electric tram is slower than the guy in the wheel chair outside resorts...and he has no arms.
capjack2000,matthew berry wrote crocodile dundee 3...i doubt he's going to acknowledge a twitter video as his worst lapse in judgement.
capjack2000,n overtime in the regulations afaik. you can file a dispute form with njdge if you feel you've been wronged.
capjack2000,right you cant increase market share by refusing to book all players on the most efficient market in us sports.
capjack2000,there have been rumors of an organization starting. if it happens i will happily donate some time to support it.
capjack2000,could it be the only people betting physically in the sportsbooks are the sharp bettors who have been limited online?
capjack2000,"in the wake of the las vegas shooting:
mgm donated $4m
caesars donated $2m

...you were saying?"
capjack2000,launching online books a full year a free throw er nj despite having a law in place before nj? impressive.
dinkinc,the pogues featuring kirsty maccoll - fairytale of new york  via   an incredible song.....  with a gambling reference to boot
dinkinc,i dislike brett anderson but this angel lineup is 10-72 against him... is that a big enough sample space ?
dinkinc,i was a bookie then. i didnt get much fixed racing action. some but that was mostly on the trotters.
dinkinc,yesterday 2-0 mlb    lost caps series in  overtime ...... baseball making a turnaround... perhaps...  4 in a row at pompano.....
dinkinc,2-1 nhl  lose vgk series..... 2-0 mlb which is kinda refreshing ..... hockey can be so frustrating and enjoyable simultaneously
robpizzola,jake also had a run of 5 games where he gave up 3 goals or less mid-november l assit year.
robpizzola,missed the early number there; n overtime loving +4 -111 although admittedly would still be a small play for me.
robpizzola,i believe they were fixed as of a certain date but the data up to that date is still incorrect.
robpizzola,for all the guys that think im betting into jordans accounts i would never give that freeloading homeless any plays.
robpizzola,36 takeaways on d l assit year... gonna be difficult for them to win without stealing possession again this year
robpizzola,if his character had a larger role in happy gilmore i would disagree but i think you nailed this one.
robpizzola,its normal. i switch focus to mlb at this point and actually am able to enjoy hockey games for once.
robpizzola,i honestly  daily fantasy sports  know how  that is  possible. i just had the best nfl season of my life.
robpizzola,i'm sure you picked the exact 12 seed that beat the 5 seed in every single one of those years.
robpizzola,it is  been a long time since i tracked or followed anyone's plays on twitter. can't help you out unfortunately.
RASPicks,has been unusually quiet about all of this.  can't wait to get his thoughts and endorsement of you on record.
RASPicks,"""everywhere"" is certainly n overtime accurate.  maybe n overtime the main screen outs but most of market had normal limits."
RASPicks,first round ncaa tournament sides expected to be released within 90 minutes.  order now if n overtime a subscriber.  .co/7biqrieuwl
RASPicks,later  college basketball  release this year means bigger market more derivatives (1h  ml)  higher limits to utilize service with. .co/z1necd66tp
RASPicks,"the ""public"" is almost never responsible for line moves in the nfl anymore.  certainly n overtime across any key number."
RASPicks,comparing nfl and ncaa limits at any major book is the best indication of which market is easier to beat.
RASPicks,you will n overtime find two better mlb handicappers posting their plays for free than steviey and buffettgambler at .co/ud8vda5lbk
RASPicks,there are 44 lined  college basketball  games friday.  first ras release of the season is exactly 24 hours away.  .co/njuvemrj
RASPicks,n overtime good just enough for value when market was +3ish.  getting wr preston davis back could help passing game.
RASPicks,may n overtime be wise to disclose such information publically as it could make those handicappers more difficult to follow.

adamchernoff,we won at a high rate which g overtime the accounts banned at the sportsbook. money was withdrawn and returned.
adamchernoff,few things are more humbling in life than the reverse sweep in sports betting...nothing brings you down to earth quicker!
adamchernoff,if you think the game was decided by two flags on a drive in the 4th quarter youd be mistaken...
adamchernoff,good call. still n overtime too sure what the hell an oshi is but i enjoy eating several of them.

kellyinvegas,lots of game le free throw . but texas looks like they want it more. hope it stays that way!
kellyinvegas,ive been to one of the coldest games on record. was at solider field. i was fine. in club level.
kellyinvegas,th against the spread the plan! looking to change up the days to o point imize for  college basketball !
kellyinvegas,its 5.5-5 across the board in vegas. cris has 4.5. so yes giving something out now is too late imo.
kellyinvegas,there are no look aheads in college. they do have games of the year that they update throughout the season.
ToddFuhrman,going to be tough for mitch to explain who he was throwing to on that pick in the film room...
ToddFuhrman,going out on a limb suggesting odds of converting 4th and 3 higher than a successful 57 yard field goal
ToddFuhrman,heard and saw same; fact number never came back a free throw er being bet up to 4.5 speaks volumes
ToddFuhrman,the look on  years old you are face when a  touchdown  at the death costs you raiders 2nd half bets...
ToddFuhrman,i watched the entire world cup on south africa and had the vuvuzela ringing in my ears for weeks ha
ToddFuhrman,ha lets see how all these states roll things out; pa tax rate is awful and their juice is reasonable
ToddFuhrman,imagine how many less people would bet if the wheel of losers and public shaming came along with it? ha
ToddFuhrman,i took the same approach needed action in every time sl overtime or the day dragged on like an eternity
ToddFuhrman,i thought donating wings buildings and libraries has been the american way to do this since the country was born

TheCousinSal,its actually fun knowing that come tomorrow morning dan quinn can be a co-worker of anyone reading this tweet. #falconfailure
TheCousinSal,i looked it up...offensively-speaking 14 points is better than 10. how does zimmer n overtime challenge that thielen  touchdown ?
TheCousinSal,great news.  if you live in nj or pa you can bet on the #emmys via  here are some winners...
TheCousinSal,ummm...wh against the spread the point of landing on the moon if were n overtime permitted to bet on it?
TheCousinSal,adesanya/gastelum lands in the top 10 mma fights ive seen. and even better for those that went the distance. #ufc236
TheCousinSal,hate to take credit here...but my passion clearly played a big part in salvaging in n out.  youre welcome l.a.
TheCousinSal,more awful game management decisions by jason garrett. jerry jones should force him to play quarterback in the 4th quarter.
TheCousinSal,whoa! an unbelichickian ending to that dolphins/p against the spread first half. im all of a sudden into this game.
TheCousinSal,the packers are looking to set the record for the most times people have officially eliminated them from the playoffs.
TheCousinSal,zeke elliott just gained a yard and a half on 3rd and 1 early in the 1st quarter. soup time!!
TheCousinSal,its just easier to back better teams to merely win. also i typically dont like having money on shitty quarterbacks.
TheCousinSal,columbia has zero energy in this game. im starting to doubt the 35 cocaine documentaries ive watched on netflix.  #worldcup18
TheCousinSal,everyone called it. shame on all of us for n overtime having the balls to bet gst by 22+ (7/2).
TheCousinSal,always perplexing when d-backs in coverage refuse to turn around when theyre 9.5 yards deep in the end zone. #whataretheywaitingfor
TheCousinSal,a tremendous slate of competitive games in the nfl today. and next week we have kc/sd rams/sea and ne/pitt. #footballisgreatagain
TheCousinSal,another spectacular loss and no cover for the browns. im speechless. mostly because i just kicked myself in the balls.
TheCousinSal,this is exactly how america felt when spencer + heidi pratt first split. but who gets custody of charles oakley?

TheCousinSal,interesting stat: the vikings are 11-0 in games during which stefon diggs throws a 3 ho you are temper tantrum.
12Xpert,i guess my point was: wouldn't it be more beneficial for punters/readers if  wrote a story explaining all of this.
12Xpert,no they won't be close. 2019 is an aberration. f-l bias will still be in effect. this is just variance.
12Xpert,if they hadn't lost to man united on 7th april 2018 they'd have done 24 in a row at 100+
12Xpert,you cant make a living from betting less than once per day. variance will kill you unless youre betting 1.25.
12Xpert,this weekend's fixtures will be available tonight since i won't be able to provide them at the usual friday time.
12Xpert,just turn the lays into backs. laying 3 is the same as backing 1.50 for it n overtime to happen.
12Xpert,intelligent thread on the merits or otherwise of measures of the bet regret campaign and its targeting of in-play betting.
12Xpert,most people argue full kelly is too risky high variance and is only suited to homo economicus. theyre probably right.
12Xpert,either the bettor has been lucky or the closing lines are n overtime accurate (the odds are still too long).

robpizzola,whenever you can check down on 4th  23 trailing by 20 in the fourth quarter you gotta do it.
robpizzola,might have been worth it for a couple bets just to make sure that you keep those accounts forever.
robpizzola,that browns pick was so embarrassing that they just cut to the rams/49ers video before the play was over.
robpizzola,looking forward to people looking at goff's yardage total today and telling me that he played a good game.
robpizzola,it will never be perfect but when you start layering subjective upon subjective it makes it so much worse.
robpizzola,i think  it is  fair to pass on a game in any sport where you question one team's motivation.
robpizzola,what if the usa wasnt also placed in a group with italy and trinidad  tobago in this double-elimination tournament?
robpizzola,can't happen with the playoff bracket. can only happen in the conference finals. if leafs win they play columbus.

Gingfacekillah,its the out sample vs in sample component (covered in the backtestinf cha point er). please dm future questions.
Gingfacekillah,probably. you'll want to take advantage of the excel add-ins in order to derive maximum benefit from the book.
Gingfacekillah,sounds like it won't be of much use to you. best of luck with  years old you are dissertation!

PikachuBets,bruh he was 0-3 l assit week anyway who cares what he's on this week. obv trash is obvvvvvvv
PikachuBets,do this for european basketball and you'll finish with like 20x the amount of points you're used to seeing

PikachuBets,then halfway thru aug he starts having a horrific run and instead he just pulls the model lol. legend
PikachuBets,i fade the public you fade me you become the public. public never wins. 2/10 would n overtime recommend
PikachuBets,he had to switch jobs to negotiate for more $ instead of just well fucking gambling for more $
PikachuBets,rightfully pointed out its $500 on fresh accts but no difference. i guess that makes it so much better!!!

Ccon8181,when the refs avoid calling fouls bc they dont want happ to be in gould trouble its a problem
Ccon8181,#louisville +4 makes the cut but like #floridastate constantly underperforms verse metrics. a pass is better then a loss.
Ccon8181,just bad read. completely wrong side. that with louisville blowing big lead and the cover late = losing day
Ccon8181,"first time ever ik ill regret it but good value dispite laying a big number:

#patriots -13.5 -110

Ccon8181,usually  daily fantasy sports  post things before finalizing but in ny working on potential big deal for contrarian investments.
Ccon8181,i'll be in nyc later this week and next and wound like to send you a press release. thanks.
Ccon8181,nothing more frustrating then backing a david shaw coached #stanford #cardinals team laying points. i feel for you guys.

kellyinvegas,right. so we both one the first game. they won the second. so theyre up 2u. 4u to 2u.
kellyinvegas,think im going with the  crew. interesting line. looks like its sp overtime on but situationally has me intrigued
kellyinvegas,maybe i can work out something with them for users who donate to get access to mine on there
kellyinvegas,purdue winner. wyoming loser on a late  touchdown . bc and wisconsin looking good. ku sucks. so terrible. lol.
kellyinvegas,of course i want to. i can not. it will take me weeks to get back that blood bath.
kellyinvegas,i was on iowa as well as a late play. iowa st collapsed on me as well. so gross.
kellyinvegas,check out  bet on it for some of my nfl. rest ill give out sunday on the  live show!
ToddFuhrman,the fact baylor making the  college football  playoff is a real possibility right now scares me half to death
ToddFuhrman,whose encouraging people betting beyond their means? recklessly promoting big parlay hits is as irresponsible as state run lotteries.
ToddFuhrman,no jason im implying one series will be great for tv ratings and the other will pale in comparison
ToddFuhrman,always good when a plan works out on the full game but betting on danny green for me was
ToddFuhrman,who defended that bullshit? league handed down a substantial fine and ban. you dont think they handled it effectively?

12Xpert,i trust people n overtime systems. corbyn trusts systems n overtime people.  that is  why he lost. the end.
12Xpert,there will be a big favourite-longsh overtime bias on this market so may just focus on the shortest prices.
12Xpert,what i am is what dr tamsin edwards ( is. have a read of her thoughtful piece to understand.
12Xpert,its still possible that its n overtime real or that if it was real once its been exploited away.
12Xpert,retweeting coz i think  it is  important. if you like this stuff a l overtime more in my book.
12Xpert,yes  that is  true. but  that is  probably the best one can do unless you have tamed laplace's demon.
12Xpert,2 percent  on profits for a market. so if you back/lay  that is  2 percent  on any trade profit.
12Xpert,these will be games awarded by the fa mostly likely because the matches were abandoned due to crowd trouble.
12Xpert,wta tennis data up to date: hiroshima nanchang and zhengzhou. no atp this week on account of davis cup.
12Xpert,time is kick-off uk local time so gmt from late october to late march +1 british summer time otherwise.
12Xpert,it might well be. imo  it is  a stupid business position to ado point  since it effectively penalises loyalty

robpizzola,the interesting thing about that dalton pick six was that he threw a screen to literally no one.
robpizzola,the difference between those examples is that in one of them you still have a chance to win.
robpizzola,very much looking forward to losing another under that was scoreless at the end of the first quarter.
robpizzola,p against the spread at dolphins next week lol.... cant wait to see what that line opens at
robpizzola,it just seems so weird for matuidi to be a sarri guy since his first touch is dreadful.

RASPicks,well when you buy a pick from ras you are 100 percent  getting the right side every time.

suuma810,the funny part is that the 5-7 eagles can still win the division and host a playoff game.
suuma810,crazy: out of 42 qbs with 8+ rush attem points  lamar jackson ranked 40th in rush dvoa. #ravens
suuma810,yep the contra arguments are definitely there. his situational play calling was also highly questionable sometimes this season.

ClevTA,day has been great all year but punting here is killing me on top of the pat. ugh
ClevTA,these injury reports this week in the nfl are something. who is playing for the jets besides darnold?
ClevTA,hilarious that these refs cant see these blatant misses in person. odell wasnt even close to catching that
ClevTA,i know u dont watch the nfl but u seriously dont think that gm was on him right?
ClevTA,whoa why are u trying to jinx this? did brendan pay u to tweet this? way too early
ClevTA,enough of penn state already. on to the game. michigan better n overtime look ahead later v ind
ClevTA,laying it with goff in 40 degrees against that pass rush with that ol is a scary proposition
ClevTA,yes agreed lockett is a stud. really just meant that d + ol + oc have major issues
ClevTA,this is tremendous. i hope this game ends with penalties being declined. might as well keep it going
ClevTA,no side or total tonight for me. im just  for philip behind that ol vs that pass rush
ClevTA,im really confused at that non challenge. 100 percent  hit the ground there was zero downside. oh well
ClevTA,right. any sort of creativity would be great. i have no idea where th against the spread gone
ClevTA,le assit u could do is run it back with a  monday night football  dk tourney. redeem yourself

PlusEVAnalytics,if theyre wearing masks and jackets can you tell enough from their costumes alone to racially profile them?
PlusEVAnalytics,so what do we think  50 percent  of entries on p against the spread -3? 55 percent ?
PlusEVAnalytics,kelly would bet such that a b outcome would net you way more money than an a outcome.
PlusEVAnalytics,going  moneyline to win prob instead of spread to win prob eliminates the need for a model entirely.

LeeSharpeNFL,"holy shit that vaccaro int.

reminded me of eddie jackson picking off stafford l assit year. brilliant play."
LeeSharpeNFL,why not? good decision making is part of qb evaluation. qbs should use down/distance information when executing plays.

LeeSharpeNFL,gotta establish the run on 1st and 10 deep in  years old you are own territory down 17.

12Xpert,you can't make it all legal because of the health implications and because athletes respond differently to doping.

mschwimer,also what do you mean they arnt all inclusive. every single pick from 2/12 to now is there.
mschwimer,registration is free for everyone. access to all historical records including all individual plays that are time stamped.
mschwimer,n overtime at all financed by bla. financed seperately. as i have said several times. completely different companies.
mschwimer,the dawgs just find ways to lose in the most painful way imaginable.  they do it every year

RufusPeabody,honestly im n overtime talking about any specific companies. just from my experience at those trade shows.
RufusPeabody,now i know what he was doing when he wasn't listening to me while we were recording.
RufusPeabody,i wonder what  percent  of plays you have illegal contact those goes uncalled. guessing its pretty high.
RufusPeabody,we should just hire someone to do most of the weekly stuff but i have trust issues.
RufusPeabody,good point. thanks jack. i believe strongly in my anti tout viewpoint but it can get tired.
RufusPeabody,can we also have a poll on whether doing research for a bet violates any unwritten rules?
RufusPeabody,the angle part is just a way to try to explain the way of thinking more clearly.
RufusPeabody,we can quantify things that affect it. we also have a sample of more than 18 games
RufusPeabody,i think there will be wayyyyy more vegetables relative to proteins. there just aren't that many proteins.
RufusPeabody,this is n overtime an operator blocking anything. this is a conference worrying about offending an operator.
jeffma,its a fair point. but i dont think the answer is selling  years old you are picks
jeffma,can we bet on who will be the most obscure player comparison? so far i have arenas
jeffma,incredibly hard for an average bettor to discern the difference between touts so still agree with  statement
jeffma,a l overtime of people can talk about super bowl props... but nobody holds a candle to
jeffma,fair. if i go at him though i will do it in person. i owe him that
jeffma,made my return to  see if tony offers me another $50 to insult another random sportscenter anchor
jeffma,i think there's value on bears +3.5 but uncertainty of rookie qb starting first game is concerning
jeffma,nah... just cavs making crazy 3's and warriors missing easy ones. basketball is pretty simple these days
jeffma,right. so pretty obvious. just  daily fantasy sports  want a smart person like you promoting gladwell bs
jeffma,yeah. but  it is  a bit of over coaching. only brad stevens is allowed to do that
SportsCheetah,wow sorry mavs fans didnt even know they lost until just now. that one is on me
SportsCheetah,the wizards just sh overtime 81 percent /100 percent /100 percent  in the 1q against the pistons.
SportsCheetah,lol that means you bet under 66 and it closed 70.5 good luck with that going forward!
SportsCheetah,prob better next week with more teams already clinched or n overtime more rivalry game variance etc.
SportsCheetah,i made a similar bet on northwestern 1q -7 as well which was also surprisingly cheap imo.
SportsCheetah,christian tucking that the entire time like they cant fumble in that spot? reach and its 6.
SportsCheetah,rams/steelers 1h under bettors enjoyed one of the most unnecessary swe against the spread of the season.
SportsCheetah,happens every year but at le assit g overtime the closing line value on under 9 wins
capjack2000,"i mean he's absolutely correct. 

however if this is how someone chooses to circle the drain...let them."
capjack2000,lets n overtime tell them how we beat them if theyre unwilling to pay for the information.
capjack2000,- the 24 percent  withholding probably stems from this section of irs guidance on regular gambling withholding:
capjack2000,"""he's a shadowy figure illuminated only by yesterday's odds."" 

sometimes figurative and literal can both be correct."
capjack2000,probably more prevalent in the philly/south jersey tv market with both pa  nj having competitive sports betting.
capjack2000,wow...that whole article is a mess. do yourself a favor and lose the seo on that one.
capjack2000,youll also learn more by betting for 10000  hours but sometimes you need to speed the plow.
capjack2000,"all th against the spread wrong in legal sports betting. 

and th against the spread saying something."
capjack2000,i think you just caught it in the midst of a line move. heres a current screenshot:
capjack2000,in their bm locations the lack of rotation numbers makes betting at the window a real pain.
capjack2000,turns out  it is  n overtime just #gamblingtwitter that gets edgy when there's nothing to bet on.
capjack2000,"here's the silver lining:
 that is  3 more online sportsbook skins that will one day be available."
dinkinc,sometimes i think my car is smarter than i am.... for starters it doesn't bet the nfl...
dinkinc,i guess the change tib dark hair is the reason she changed the spelling of her name
dinkinc,they all trained great.  every bc horse but a random longsh overtime or two always trains great
dinkinc,the downside of twitter is you lose friends .... the upside is you make so many more
dinkinc,think shayna.  the exact age she began wrestling.  she did have a l overtime of conditioning tho
dinkinc,stick to what you know.... i played toronto -3 on the opener and thought i was stealing
dinkinc,despite what the advertisement tells you santa anita is very hard.  go with the pretty mountains instead
robpizzola,cowboys at -3 or less would have been an absolute banger next week but such is life.
robpizzola,if they were crying instead he would have tweeted that they are too so free throw .
robpizzola,it is  almost as if you literally didn't read a single thing in either of those tweets.
robpizzola,and if you win half  years old you are bets you come out on the losing end.
robpizzola,when its 2019 and you judge people on the internet without knowing a single thing about them.
robpizzola,gurleys entire body is in the end zone... i dont know what these clowns are looking at.
robpizzola,inter to win serie a probably a decent bet now that their champions league campaign is over.
robpizzola,took a shitty number on over in dal/nyg. that garbage time  touchdown  saved me. lucky. very lucky.
robpizzola,nothing brings me as much joy as the opposite field bomb in the  ho you are derby.
robpizzola,i  daily fantasy sports  know but probably based on his course history here and yes likely insignificant.
robpizzola,i think hes definitely better than seba right now. but seba at his peak was just unreal.
robpizzola,life lessons to be learned here.  daily fantasy sports  have kids and  daily fantasy sports  wear clothes.
robpizzola,2 laps of the bahrain grand prix already had more action than the entire australian grand prix.
RASPicks,asking for a friend.... how far did you sit from each other?  how big was the group?
RASPicks,we are pretty satisfied and comfortable with o you are volume right now but appreciate the input.
RASPicks,we stopped doing totals two years ago due to market conditions (only tv games at cris etc.)
RASPicks,"representing that handicappers are ""pros"" and/or that they win when they  daily fantasy sports  is a misrepresentation=scam."
RASPicks,is anyone other than betonline going to put up totals for the two college football games tonight?
RASPicks,possibly march ncaa hoops or wnba.  definitely will be back for first half of 2013 college football.
RASPicks,"most books have wised up and won't give you the ""right"" price especially on nfl key numbers."
RASPicks,no worries guys still put out 2nd halves and other good stuff here on twitter for free.

ProfessorShine,many third party sites are paid so u can go in and delete winners (oskeim-ing).  so no

ProfessorShine,cbs radio michael jenkins.  dont tell him kelly bikini isnt a serious guest.  he gets very agitated
suuma810,does anyone else struggle to find good bets this week? worst board of the season for me.
suuma810,and then he opens another series with a run for a loss against a weak pass defense.
suuma810,good old andy reid took away a touchdown opportunity by refusing to take his l assit timeout.
suuma810,this is a trade th against the spread going to have an impact for both teams involved.
suuma810,maybe because he thinks the run is n overtime fully established in all phases of a game.
suuma810,great job this season guys! keep up the good work  thanks for having me on the show!
suuma810,zumal immer die mglichkeit besteht dass solch ein pick trade-material werden kann. tte den jets auch gut.
suuma810,patriots/lions total opened at 46 has been bet up to 53.5/54 now. move of over a touchdown.
suuma810,denke dass sie im dezember um die wild card spielen und alles unter 8-8 wrd mich enttuschen.
suuma810,will most likely be a tough first season but i like what i see from him individually.
ClevTA,lol. u should see the one i created for nba dra free throw kings l assit year.
ClevTA,jesus man n overtime everything he reports is so you are grapes. hes been accurate a lot
ClevTA,take cavs tonight. a freebie to make up for all  years old you are bad takes earlier
ClevTA,thanks to jonathan williams i will n overtime be winning $1 million with my goff/woods/higbee stack today
ClevTA,no idea. but i wouldnt assume that. id assume an l to baltimore to get to 9-7
ClevTA,i didnt bet either game man was just laughing bc everyone was on both jax and zona
ClevTA,has either qb thrown a single deep ball over 25 yards? feels like one is coming soon
ClevTA,right but  that is  n overtime what had nothing to do with the story or my tweet
ClevTA,expected points added. so every play has a value added or lost. but turnovers are especially harsh
ClevTA,hes n overtime picking them to win man. the point spread was created to be the equalizer
ClevTA,im wondering if theyll continue to be the 85 bears or just a really really good defense
ClevTA,they stayed in indy they didnt travel back and forth. also their opponent wasnt off a bye
ClevTA,so just like the browns the rams cure for offensive issues is to go heavy 12 personnel
ClevTA,they led the nfl in explosive plays and 2nd in red zone efficiency. they kind of were
ClevTA,curious where did the ratio of fantasy  points  to totals come from? have never seen that before
ClevTA,i barely watched the game but is malzahn allergic to 2 point conversions or what actually happened
CizzlingSports,"""that most of us will disagree with"" sounds like a polite way of saying something else lol"

spanky,ive had guys on twitter offer to pay me to work in o you are office lol.
spanky,when i say beating the closing line i mean betting a better number than the closing line...
spanky,most important question is beating the closing number majority of the time.  every other question is irrelevant.
spanky,nothing be against the spread driving in costa rica where red lights are merely suggested stop signs
spanky,no bullshit here buddy. unless you come up with someone its you that should stop the bullshit
spanky,same company  runs  runs  .... i beat them pretty good and the next day they banned me...
spanky,while i appreciate  years old you are analysis im n overtime sure you considered the 200k bankroll.
spanky,innocent people died you jerk.  show some respect.  what if that was  years old you are family?
spanky,sorry break even  percent  was 53.3.... im n overtime sure buddy i dont really do nfl futures
spanky,jake is what makes this podc assit so good... im honored to be a part of it
DocBettor,happy to pull off the #nbaorgtfo middle on this with  who had portland against the spread pregame
DocBettor,no problem -- maybe in the future but can't really track it for all the live bets
DocBettor,let it ride. bet a smaller amount next time if you dont feel comfortable in this spot.
DocBettor,live bet: new england patriots 1st half team total over 13.5 -125 #gop against the spread #nygvsne
PlusEVAnalytics,what kind of nonsense is this? if we had a practice were guessing he wouldnt have participated?
PlusEVAnalytics,where can i get odds on ertz hits the injury tent before the end of this game
PlusEVAnalytics,so wh against the spread the action here? confirm that to be the case? step 5 done.
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont get it. wh against the spread so special about the surface that would impact totals?
PlusEVAnalytics,you know who would n overtime have blown those calls? andre proulx th against the spread who.
PlusEVAnalytics,todays weird stuff promoted into my tl. hey  i thought you g overtime rid of campaign ads
PlusEVAnalytics,"+300 he wins enough to avoid paying anything
+100 he makes the payment
+200 he stiffs everyone"
PlusEVAnalytics,"1 the kelly criterion was n overtime built as a way to judge a model.

2 bullshit."
PlusEVAnalytics,same model just use the odds implied prob (or some transformation thereof) as one of the variables
PlusEVAnalytics,should have clarified im happy to answer questions from anyone up to the 99.9 percentile of annoying
PlusEVAnalytics,explains why i just heard a weird smack sound like a million palms on a million faces
PlusEVAnalytics,im interested to know how you analyze these. maybe ill start a podc assit and interview you...
PlusEVAnalytics,you know who was an amate you are at one point? michael jordan. tiger woods. napoleon. jesus.
PlusEVAnalytics,what youre describing is called epistemic uncertainty. lots of cool stuff out there if you google it.
PlusEVAnalytics,raps are +181 to win g4 and +500 to win in 5. the market thinks hes playing...
PlusEVAnalytics,this doesnt excuse what they did but horse racing odds dont work the same as other sports.
PlusEVAnalytics,maximum likelihood estimation - p daily fantasy sports  of stuff like negative binomial and compound gamma distributions.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes. find the set of bets that maximizes log(end bankroll) where end bankroll reflects all pending bets
aluckyaday,it was in my selections today so the early money on it was n overtime that quiet!
aluckyaday,it looks like the defence is n overtime going to put up a case. guilty as charged!
aluckyaday,did n overtime do theresa may much good when she ran scared. hopefully history will repeat itself.
aluckyaday,guess the issue is its hard to prove. can't exactly take a blood test to detect it!
aluckyaday,i think without each way the success of the model will depend on the failure of mvg!
aluckyaday,still wondering why they allowed the kinnock amendment to pass.  daily fantasy sports  trust him at all.
aluckyaday,come on mr tony bloom join the gambling twitter community. you could have so much fun here.
aluckyaday,that does n overtime make sense. somebody has to lose to pay them and the exchange commission.
aluckyaday,fi free throw h full house of the year! equallying 2016 and still 5 months to go!
aluckyaday,pin overtime now favorite for the tour. the bookies must be french first alaphilippe and now pinot!

joeytunes2,couldn't believe it. i ordered a game. and i usually bet max always. this blew me back..
joeytunes2,saints have 80 yrds in penalties this drive and still n overtime even getting to 3rd down..

EdMillerPoker,i do too and it puts me forever on one side of an invisible line in life
EdMillerPoker,impressive you remember that.. pretty sure mine was gnr appetite for destruction but can't swear to it

LeeSharpeNFL,how else could you have so many black characters if they weren't all related? doesn't make sense.
LeeSharpeNFL,they've always done the saturday games this way. i assume they've determined it gets the best ratings.
LeeSharpeNFL,so they just barely beat out the 2019 cowboys for this record overall (since realignment in 2002).
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm a bears fan since i started watching football in the mid 1990s. i sympathize with this.
LeeSharpeNFL,finally automated the most annoying part of my nfl weekly turnaround process and it feels so good.
LeeSharpeNFL,oh heh yeah i guess i scrolled p assit it a free throw er ctrl+f for bears.
LeeSharpeNFL,absolutely yes. love that about it. learned so much from the gre against the spread on here.
LeeSharpeNFL,"qb running is better than rb running.

it is n overtime nearly as important as actual passing."
LeeSharpeNFL,til momentum is so powerful it n overtime only applies within a game but between games too.
LeeSharpeNFL,josh allen playing 3d chess by taking the sack now so patriots have less time on offense.
LeeSharpeNFL,"somehow* both of these teams have winning records.

* - they get to play vs. nfc east"
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah. comes down a l overtime more to how the packers do (including vs. vikings next week).
LeeSharpeNFL,"ahhh i underestimated how terrible decisions being made on both sides are.

it all makes sense now."
LeeSharpeNFL,i understand in conce point  the first run because they're so far back. but the second run?!
LeeSharpeNFL,i actually like them and was surprised by my partner's take. i just thought it was funny.
LeeSharpeNFL,the only thing jason garrett has done well today is n overtime calling timeout earlier this half.
LeeSharpeNFL,the sad thing is he'd still probably be the best hc whose team plays at metlife stadium.
LeeSharpeNFL,weird i too have only one had one experience as a bears fan with consistently bad quarterbacking.
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  really cool. :) (and agree with  years old you are l assit sentence of course.)

AndyMSFW,you gotta think about giving chip a chance in the nfl a free throw er that game.
AndyMSFW,hoping that btc falls to 3k today so that  years old you are liability isn't so big.

TheKostos,yes. bots. they end up selling joy immediately and then they get resold for crazy amounts. aggravating
TheKostos,he stunk at the end and the giants should never have ke point  him as the starter.

RufusPeabody,if it shi free throw s to the fair price there's no value on either side.
RufusPeabody,it is  a broader point about people buying picks in general n overtime having enough information.

suuma810,gregg williams: either we cover marquise brown with a linebacker or n overtime at all.
suuma810,refs missed a huge false start by rob havenstein before that big gain by everett.
suuma810,catching up with the dra free throw . ive just become a life-long #dolphins fan.
suuma810,it was the worst playoff coaching performance / game plan since chuck pagano in 2014.
suuma810,maybe the #titans should trade for amari cooper. those failed rece point ions are brutal.
suuma810,todd haley calling a league-high 48 percent  runs on 2nd  10+ isn't helping him either.
suuma810,"positive closing line value on all fo you are early games 

lets go team suuma!!!"

ClevTA,no 4th and 1 and 4th and goal from the 10 are totally different situations
ClevTA,ive now gotten good exposure to both red zone channels and siciliano is just awful
ClevTA,huh? u wouldve  had the ball back before the 2m earning so essentially 4 tos
ClevTA,bc they didnt know he was a lunatic when they dra free throw ed him
ClevTA,patriots prefer their receivers to be over 63 these days. the run is over. sad
CizzlingSports,will get lost in this ucla win but dtr took a sack on this play
CizzlingSports,why r we n overtime detailing and upd8ng the performances of the two 17-week packages?
