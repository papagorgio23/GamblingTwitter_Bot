mschwimer,so answer this.  if a person invests 1 0  thousand  in the stock market and gets back 2 0  thousand  total and that same person invests 1 0  thousand  in betting on sports and ends with 1 0 0  thousand  but made 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  in bets (never at risk for than 1 0  thousand ) did his stock market or sports betting get him a better roi?,337
mschwimer,if the bet has a true prob of winning at 5 8  %  at -1 2 0 . it closes at -1 6 0 . and no injuries etc. i believe that bet at -1 2 0  now has ~5 8 .5  %  chance to win. others suggest it has more than a 6 0  %  chance to win. all numbers are off top of head. using them to illustrate the point.,294
mschwimer,monday is the last day of free picks. tuesday starts our weekly packages. if you sign up for 1  week it costs  $ 2 5 0  for minimum of 5 0  recs. if we are negative units we will give you  $ 3 0 0  back. or the 4  week plan which costs  $ 9 0 0 . if we are negative units we give you  $ 2 0 0 0  back.,301
mschwimer,"1 0 0 0 0 0 0  people said they were going to be mlb players. 9 9 .9 9  %  didnt. 

1 0 0 0 0 0 0  people said they were going to be ceos of a hundred million dollar company. 9 9 .9 9  %  didnt. 

i did both. this is just next on the list. many people have bet against me. no one has won yet.",292
mschwimer,you are correct. our record of more than 2 5 0 0  recs are all mlb and ncaab. ncaab backtested at 5 6  % . in reality over 1 4 0 0  picks we did 5 8 .3  % . mlb projected only +4 0  units on year. we are on pace for +6 0 ish. dont think nfl or ncaaf will be different. but i could be wrong,289
mschwimer,this is amazing.  and i have each won 6  consecutive best bets. the likelihood of us picking 1 2  straight winners in a sample of 1 2  games assuming we have a 5 0 /5 0  chance at each pick is roughly 1  in 5 0 0 0 . even if we had a 6 0  %  edge on each pick it is 1  in 5 0 0 .,279
mschwimer,no. think about it in finance. if you give a manager 1  thousand  to invest. they give you back 1 .1  thousand  at the end of the year. but they made  $ 1 m worth of trades. you are saying your roi is 1 0 0 /1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ? literally no one in the finance world would agree with that. im sorry,293
mschwimer,jambos had its craziest week to date. heading into the weekend we were -1 7 .3 2  units  for the week.  then we rattled off a +2 4 .0 4  units  sat/sun/mon due to a 9 -1  (+8 .4 5  units ) ncaa football saturday and 1 0 -5  (+6 .1 3  units ) nfl sunday.  below full recap from when we started selling picks.,307
mschwimer,literally not a single one of my subs has ever said if they bet  $ 3 0 0  on a total for the game the 1 h instantly moves. first i am hearing if it. we have had almost 1 0 0 0  subs over the last 6  months including many pros. they never said this to me so its hard for me to believe,283
mschwimer,this is a great point. we have a units calculator on our site. so you type in the amount you bet on a game and see if its right for you. you can bet whatever you want on a given game. you are 1 0 0  %  right if we are down 5  units and you bet 5  thousand  per game you will lose  $ ,283
mschwimer,i think it has to be exactly 3  runs. however to rufus point it would be 3 -0  games where the pregame total was 1 1 . but that would be way too small a sample. in fact i think id bet that blowing a 3 -0  lead in the 9 th w pregame total of 1 1  has not happened in 1 0  years.,277
mschwimer,"i have a great way to solve it!
1 . go to automated k zone
2 . break k zone into 9  sections on the big screen. 
3 . if any pitch hits the middle section for a called k it counts as 2  strikes. 

this will lead to a huge drop off in guess hitting. balls will be in play much more.  1 /2",286
mschwimer,"we have 2  recs left in our 1  week package. in 5 7  recs we are +8 .5 6  units against market consensus lines. if subs used our system right ( $ 3 0 0 ) per game. they would profit  $ 2 3 1 8  after paying our fees in 1  week. 

these are plain facts. no selling. admit- 1  week sample size.",292
mschwimer,"1 .  we 1 0 0  %  beat bookmaker lines.  both when we release and close.  we will highlight on our website so easier to see.
2 .  we did much better in ncaab in big games.  still won but did worse in extra games. 
3 .  we have 3  nfl bets and went 2 -1 !
i do nothing but tell the truth",286
mschwimer,using an extreme example to show how bad that chart is. if i charged  $ 1  for a pick. if it lost id give back  $ 1 0 0 . that is 1 0 0  %  positive ev for the sub. anyone with a brain would agree. my question is where is the line between positive and negative ev on  $  back plus guarantee?,291
mschwimer,this is such a classic response. bottom line. if you really believe we cant beat the market then buy 1 0 0  of our 1 7  week packages. it will cost you 3 0 0  thousand . if you are right you get  $ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . we put our money where our mouth is. question is will you?,272
mschwimer,to drastically over simplify. mlb owners are faced w the decision. do i make  $ 2 0 0 m in profit and have x %  chance to win ws or do i make a  $ 1 5 0 m profit and have 2  times  %  chance to win the ws. recently most owners have been choosing option 1 . fans should hold owners accountable.,293
mschwimer,lets do it!  what term have i disagreed with? im in for whatever terms you want so long as it fits our system. go to our site and click the long write up. also if you want to get more money im happy to put more in escrow. 2 0 0  subs and ill put  $ 2 m in 1 0 0  % ,265
mschwimer,"with all due respect. they made a comment that its unlikely for us to win over 1 0 0 0  plays. i told they actually believe it then they should put up 3 0 0  thousand  and i will give them  $ 1 m if they are right. then they got scared and decided not to do it. 

actions speak louder than words.",296
mschwimer,if you think our system doesnt work then you are the  person that should sign up for our 1 7  week package. dont play any of our recs. if you are correct and we cant beat the market you make 1 0  thousand . if your wrong you only lose 3  thousand . we put our money where our mouth is. will you?,295
mschwimer,i havent. just started doing it this year. my career started on december 8 th 2 0 1 8 . from then until now  has made 1 6 1 1  recommendations and is up 1 9 0 .4 8  units. so if you bet  $ 1 0 0  on all our games you would be up almost 2 0  thousand  in 5  months.,264
mschwimer,2 nd consecutive bad week for jambos. -7 .1 8  units.  happy to see our nfl go 1 3 -6  for the week.  upset to see us not pick correctly on a single side in the alcs.  ncaaf also not good last week.  today is the last day to sign up for this weeks package and be eligible for the  $  back!,289
mschwimer,"great week 1  in the books! even after paying our  $ 2 5 0  1  week fee subs would have been + $ 2 2 9 7  (using jambos system)

sign up for week 2  today to get the money back guarantee plus! signing up after 6 pm subs not eligible for money back plus! will have to wait until next week.",288
mschwimer,if you dont think we will win give me one logical reason you wouldnt sign up for the 4  week package. zero ncaa basketball.  $ 9 0 0  for  2 0 0 + recs. if we lose you get  $ 2 0 0 0  back (including fee). why on earth wouldnt you do this unless you dont believe a thing you say?,279
mschwimer,gotcha!  if our model says a football team should be -2 .5  (+1 0 0 ) and the market line is a pickem (+1 0 0 ) we believe the actual edge percentage is 6 .2  % .  if the game closes at -1 .5  then our edge over the closing line becomes 2 .8  % . that what you are asking?,272
mschwimer,so please correct me.  i did this in person in vegas.  when i was shut down everywhere i was still able to get  $ 3 0 0  down.  some places  $ 5 0 0  but lowest i saw was  $ 3 0 0 .  this was in december of 1 8  so things might have changed.  would love to be enlightened.,272
mschwimer,"while that scenario is highly unlikely it is possible. here is who the system is for. 

1 . people that think we are full of it and believe our system wont work. 
2 . people that can afford to bet  $ 3 0 0  per play over 1 0 0 0 + plays. 

system not for believers who bet small amounts",286
mschwimer,"it is indeed. i have always been one to have big dreams. so far every dream i have had 9 9 .9  %  of people have doubted. but they have all come true. 1 . being major leaguer. done 
2 . being ceo of a  $ 1 0 0 m company. done. 
3 . being the world wide market maker (tbd)",271
mschwimer,"much stronger statistical signs if a bet is good or not occur during game play. 

if we model 6 7  possessions in a basketball game and the market prices in 7 5 . so we take the under. then the team has 6 7  possessions. that is a great sign. if they make all 3 s and we lose. so what.",285
mschwimer,"so then either 1  of 2  things is true. 

1 . judging plays by clv is the wrong way to judge an edge. 

or

2 . we have been more than 1  in a million lucky. do math on +1 7 1  units in 2 7 6 8  recs assuming no edge. my guess is more than 1  in 1 m",249
mschwimer,"yes. that is precisely what i am saying. of the picks we take we destroy the closing line. 

to be clear. i am not saying we beat the closing line on every single play. only the plays we recommend. 

to be exact. over 2 7 6 8  plays we are +1 4 0 .0 7  units vs. the betcris closing line",287
mschwimer,"1 . agree. those picks were poop.
2 . disagree w model being broken.
we put all our plays on . free for everyone.  started 6  weeks ago. if you put  $ 1 0 0 0  on every recommended play you would be up  $ 3 4 8 6 0 . tmk the best in the world during that time frame.",266
mschwimer,i 1 0 0  %  admit that you know way more about the gambling space than me. probably more than i will ever know. all we really know how to do is predict outcomes of games. and we believe we do it better than anyone else. if you dont believe than put your  $  where your mouth is. we do!,285
mschwimer,watch my interviews. i was sure the betting community would go bananas. that is why i created the system! if you think its bs then put your money where your mouth is!!! if your right you get 1 0  thousand . if not you lose 3  thousand . why wouldnt you do this? other than not believing what you say,299
mschwimer,that has not been the case so far. our rec is  $ 3 0 0  per game. so if u follow the system no need for multiple books. obviously people bet whatever they want. we have a units calculator on our website so you can type in your unit size and see what package if any is right for you.,282
mschwimer,great question. we are using market consensus lines and we have a full write up on what to do if that happens in our faqs. we also have our record vs. closing lines and its very similar to our market line record. something like +1 7 7  units vs. +1 4 5  units over almost 3 0 0 0  picks.,287
mschwimer,also we are not including a 3 -0  lead. which is statistically a lot different than 9 -6  heading into the 9 th. a 3 -0  lead is less likely to turn into a loss. in the last 1 0  years i doubt it has happened more than a dozen times. would love for someone to dig up the actual,277
mschwimer,market line is defined as betcris/bookmaker line at time of release.  first half under for san diego st. was 6 6  but best available in us was 6 5 .5 .  this is a very rare occurrence but it does happen.  happens other way as well where cris would be 6 5  and ba in us is 6 5 .5,278
mschwimer,"if a bettor bets at mgm and wants to know his clv for that specific bet. should he

a) find the closing line at mgm and compare that to his bet?

b) find the pinny line at time he made the bet and compare it to pinny close?

c) use the mgm line and compare that to pinny close?",277
mschwimer,"1 . check public sec filing. we raised  $ 2 3 m as a back stop. 
2 . agreed over time this will happen. when it does we will shut it down
3 . please change to never buy picks unless you get positive ev. up until now its been impossible to get that. we are changing the game.",274
mschwimer,so do we have a deal. you spend 3 0 0  thousand  on 1 0 0  packages. we put  $ 1 m in an escrow of your choice. after 1 7  weeks if we are down units vs. betcris line you get the  $ 1 m. if not we get the  $ 1 m.  do we have a deal?,232
mschwimer,"think about it logically.  if you sit down with  $ 1  thousand  at a black jack table for a day.  you end with  $ 1 1 0 0  without rebuying but wagered  $ 1 m your then are you saying ""amount invested"" would equal  $ 1 m even though you never risked more than  $ 1  thousand ?",276
mschwimer,"right. if we ended w the units we were down. roughly 6  units down. our 1 7  week subscribers would be +5 2 0 0 . 
paid 3  thousand  for package
lost  $ 1 8 0 0  in bets
received  $ 1 0 0 0 0  in jambos rebate 

total for sub + $ 5 2 0 0",237
mschwimer,no. we can 1 0 0  %  profit from gambling on our own. this is purely a business decision. taking less short term money early to make big long term returns later. in a vacuum sub service or betting. betting 1 0 0  %  more profitable. but sub service is step 1  on a very long term play.,285
mschwimer,we are just starting out. im sure this will not be the last issue we have. how do you feel that on day 1  we are more credible than you after being in the industry for 1 0  years? we put our money behind our picks. you dont. so we trust our picks more than you trust yours.,273
mschwimer,we have built a system where it is literally impossible to call bs. plain and simple. if you dont think we can beat the market you should sign up and not play a single game we rec. if you do believe in us and can afford do use our system correctly then sign up and play our recs.,279
mschwimer,i take 1 0 0  %  responsibility. instead of getting a peak mlb model i thought it was best to focus on ncaa hoops. at the time it was great. picked 6 4  %  ats for the tournament. and now everyone but 2  people are focused on football to make sure we are ready by beginning of season.,284
mschwimer,1 0 0  %  agree with this. which is why we made our service free for everyone starting on 2 /1 2 . everyone can verify who signed up!  notice you have never seen anyone in twitter say we added picks late or fudged a record. and trust me  would have called us out if we did.,273
mschwimer,here it is.  i do not think books will react in a short amount of time to this.  however if you believe they will then do not buy the 1 7  week package.  instead buy the 1  week package and keep doing it a week at a time.  when the market adjusts simply stop buying the packages,278
mschwimer,you claim you have 5 0 0  thousand  of people wanting to short us.  was that a lie?  if it was the truth why don't you do this? requires zero trust on your end as we will put the money in up front in an escrow account of your choosing.  why would you need to trust us?,268
mschwimer,i am assuming this is a joke? putting up 2 6 0 0  plays after they start??? all our plays have been free for everyone. we have had hundreds of subscribers. we have never once put a play out after it was posted. but if you actually believe this then put your money where your mouth is!,284
mschwimer,our system is based on subscribers betting  $ 3 0 0  per play. they can do whatever we want. but our system is based on that number.  $ 3 0 0  is easy to get down on the plays we post. feel free to check all our plays on our site. everything is available to the public.,269
mschwimer,again. depends on how you define edge  % . out edge %  numbers fully include juice. so when we say we have a 4  %  edge. we mean a 4  %  edge over the line we would bet including juice. and you dont need to trust me. look at over 2 5 0 0  of our picks!,252
mschwimer,very easy answer. they say no tout has a system that works. if they did then they would bet themselves.  simple answer. if you actually believe that you should be the  person to sign up. cost 3  thousand  if wrong but +1 0  thousand  if you r right. put your  $  where your mouth is. we do,289
mschwimer,ty rufus. situation - cardinals vs. mets last night. i had over 7  and cards ml. score is 4 -2  going into the 9 th. cards score 2  in 9 th to tie it at 4 -4 . game gets suspended and will pick up today. fanduel says both plays still are still pending. what say you?,266
mschwimer,"3  early season mlb thoughts. imo
1 . the padres should put a rush on mckenzie gore. kid is legit and padres need arms. should move guys up instead of trading. 
2 . dan vogelbach is who i thought he was. should play every day. 
3 . victor robles should be batting 1 /2  in nats order.",284
mschwimer,now that is the definition of picking and choosing. you left out our week 1  of selling picks when we were +8 .4 9  units. after 3  full weeks of selling picks we are down -0 .4 3  units. and that includes the worst week in jambos history. those are the facts. no picking and choosing.,285
mschwimer,last twitter message rufus sent was that he would love to debate but tough to fit it in the bet the process pod.  i assume that means he wouldn't mind spending 1 5 -3 0  minutes on mine as he could debate and not worry about bet the process schedule. i will work around his schedule,282
mschwimer,has been a friend way before congo haha. way before we started any of this. i never said he endorses us. i said he has seen all our plays come out live from 2 /1 2  on and he knows a lot of my investors and can vouch for the sincerity of the guarantee. thats all,262
mschwimer,i raised  $ 1 8 2 m in 5  weeks. had to return  $ 5 2 m of it because i was only looking for  $ 1 3 0 m. these are stone cold facts that can be verified in sec records. i really hope pinny or cris says yes so i can prove you wrong!,231
mschwimer,we agree. twitter words are meaningless. all about the words on our website and the ts and cs. with current ts and cs you cant find a single thing that we could use to get out of our guarantee. and that is a fact. if you can please let me know and we will fix it!,263
mschwimer,i fully agreed to have a neutral 3 rd party hold the money? why do you insist on lying to everyone? you asked if a person could hold the money.  i said no has to be an institution.  what if the person were to get hit by a bus? my board would never agree to that.,262
mschwimer,"now can you please answer my question? i have answered every single one of yours. yet you avoid mine. 

if you believe a single word you say why wouldnt you buy 1 0 0 + packages. we are giving you 2 .3 -1  odds! we have not said no to a single one of your terms.",262
mschwimer,but buy 1 0 0  packages at least if you think what we have is bs. you get 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  if you are right and only lose 3 0 0 0 0 0  if you are wrong. if you truly believe we cant do it you would make that purchase. right?,222
mschwimer,"for those of you who have wondered what the end game is please read the article on bloomberg business. 

we provide full transparency and financial accountability for our picks. 1 7  week plan costs  $ 3  per pick. if we cant beat vegas we pay each subscriber 1 0  thousand . this is not a drill",295
mschwimer,no.  it totally depends on the situation of the game. basically my model said it was almost twice as likely for mets to win f5  and pirates to win game vs. pirates to win f5  and mets to win game. which is worth paying the juice on a push which is by far most likely scenario.,276
mschwimer,"2  things. 
1 . bla is not the benefactor of this bill. it hurts us as a company if this passes. it is 1 0 0  %  about protecting minor league players. 
2 . mlbpa has been aware of bad actors in this space for more than a year and they have done nothing about it.",263
mschwimer,"a few things here. 

1 .  on tuesday i did hit everything spot on except my best bet.  ugh

2 .  you should be very happy i was not on yesterday as i was ice cold and would have given you all losers. 

3 .  i will be on tomorrow and hopefully giving out pure heat!",264
mschwimer,my best guess on how  does by sport. our best sport will be nfl. 2 nd best is ncaa football. 3 rd best is ncaa basketball. 4 th best will be nba. 5 th best will be mlb. i also think there will not be a season in any sport where we dont beat the market.,252
mschwimer,first round must plays according to the math are baylor (6 8  %  on cuse) uc irvin (8 1  %  on k st) utah st (5 0  %  of money on both) wisconsin and nevada (5 2  %  on florida).  unless you like the opposites to win 2  games you should take these first round games,265
mschwimer,i have invited you to come on jambos podcast so you don't need to subject your 7  listeners. you say we are bs but you are too scared to have a conversation about it? if you want we can just have a phone call and not do a podcast so no one else can hear?,254
mschwimer,your direct quote to me in april was that you or train scrapped all of our stuff and determined we were posting lines that were on average .2 6 c off from the  average market line. this was before we started to use cris exclusively. if like a hawk was too far then i apologize.,277
mschwimer,cool. we think opposite things. i will give you +2 3 0  odds that i am right on as much money as you want. i will put the money up front in an escrow of your choosing so zero chance of payout risk on your end. name 1  single reason why you wouldnt accept this?,260
mschwimer,i see what you are saying. yes. i am 1 0 0  %  a lifetime loser betting on sports. i personally dont think anyone can win on eye test. this is why i hired a team of 2 5  people incliding phd statisticians and machine learning experts. those guys are the heart of the company.,275
mschwimer,again. we have money in a bank account that has nothing to do w expenses. that money is only there to pay back people if we end up losing. which is why we can only take x number of subs. then we will have to stop because we dont have enough in case we lose.,257
mschwimer,i am not. there are federal laws here. you are suggesting that im going to break federal law. we will not do that. that is the guarantee. if we dont pay you then we are breaking the law. just like if mgm doesnt pay you they are breaking the law. nothing to do w trust.,268
mschwimer,"we told  that we will pay up front. they still wont do it! your exact suggestion! because they know how legit we are and they dont want to make a bad bet. 

we were mgm in the example. while we are only worth  $ 1 0 0 m+ and not many billions. same principle applies.",267
mschwimer,we also line shop because that is what our subscribers want. we started by using only 1  book but the overwhelming feedback was our subscribers wanted to know where the best line was so that is what we do now.  hope to have 2  record tabs. one for best line and one using 1  book.,280
mschwimer,question. i just saw the plays you put out today and you have seattle -1 0 8 . i see them at much higher prices everywhere. what book do you use for your lines? also do you email subscribers when the picks are available? i never got an email but i just registered this morning.,277
mschwimer,this is a correct statement as well. but i could say the same thing about subs that bet 1 0 0  per game and how much more profitable. we have been consistent and only judge our record on our recommended  $ 3 0 0  per unit. key is consistency and not picking and choosing.,271
mschwimer,"also i didnt include today because today is not final yet. 

week 1  subs won over 2  thousand 
4  week subs are + $ 
1 7  week subs are + $  after they get 1 0  thousand  from us because we are - units

only sub that is negative are week 2  solo packages.",256
mschwimer,in addition i will have my dms up during the call.  so if any questions come up as a result of my answers i will be able to answer those as well!  sorry for late notice but wanted to get this out before week 1 .  thanks again to all the new registered users!,258
mschwimer,"this might be one of the funniest tweets i have seen!  very well done.  

but for real our actual bank letter was posted to our site this morning before i sent out the tweet.  (see 1 st faq)

p.s. how long did this take you? regardless it was 1 0 0  %  worth it.",262
mschwimer,"please  just tell the people the truth.  you did your research and you realized +2 3 0  odds is not a good bet on your side because you know we have a way better chance to beat the market than that.

literally no other reason could exist.  if one does please let us know.",271
mschwimer,so you are going to talk about the system i created and you think the best way to do that is not have me on to explain it? what if you are missing something that i could clarify? seems like the best way to get the truth would be straight from the source no?,257
mschwimer,"id argue you guys are better than any lawyer i could hire! you guys are the only people i have been able to find that hates the touting industry as much as i do!

new ts and cs are up!  we made a lot of changes that cizzle suggested. thanks again for the help!",260
mschwimer,thank you! for the record. im glad this uproar is occurring. people should be skeptical. this space is filled with thieves and liars. but not one of them filed a form d w the sec and has proof of funds. we have done everything humanly possible to show we are legit because we are,279
mschwimer,i have not questioned any of that.  all i am saying is they make comments that they believe jambos is full of it. yet when it came time to put their money where their mouth is they got scared and ran away. doesnt take anything away from what you said. both can be true.,269
mschwimer,only 1  way to possibly be exposed. that is to have people buy packages and take our money. only one way for you to be exposed. to talk a lot then not back it up by not buying a package. which is precisely what you are doing. as always. actions speak louder than words,268
mschwimer,you are very welcome. we have been going at this for a while. more than 2 7 0 0  picks. all free for everyone. line movement didnt matter too much. but you can see all that for yourself as we post everything with closing lines as well. +1 4 0  units against closing line.,271
mschwimer,thats the best part about full transparency. no angle to find. if you believe in us. sign up and play our recs. if not sign up and dont play them. only people that should not sign up are people that believe in us but can only play  $ 2 0  per game or so.,254
mschwimer,this is a great point. we only have enough currently for a # of subs. however we will be able to raise more if we need to. i really hope we need to! we have raised a total of  $ 1 7 9 m for our different ventures. raising more wont be a problem.,245
mschwimer,best part is it didnt change our ncaa basketball record at all! still better than 5 8  %  ats when using bet cris lines at time of our release. we actually are better in terms of units. due to better juice on those cites. record worse in mlb though. full details to follow asap,277
mschwimer,seattle is now -1 2 4  on the site. so when you grade are you grading on the closing line then? and if so what book do you use to determine the closing line? if seattle gets to -1 5 0  will you remove it from the site as its no longer an edge?,243
mschwimer,has released 1 6  full game overs. the average line for those plays have been 7 .3 4 . average actual runs scored in those games is 9 .1 5 . yet we are down 1 .6  units. hard to be that unlucky. we either win big or lose tight in this small sample.,248
mschwimer,im going to go on a twitter rant. 1  thing that frustrates me is when baseball fans say things like im glad we didnt sign player x that contract is too expensive. baseball doesnt have a cap! in football or basketball that makes a lot of sense because  $  can go elsewhere 1 /2,276
mschwimer,i cant believe i am saying this but the stuff i look at says this is a great trade for the wiz. getting rid of rivers is addition by subtraction for the way the wiz are built. kelly is a terrible wiz fit and overrated in general. ariza is a perfect fit for wiz.,261
mschwimer,selling picks for 1 8  weeks and are +1 9 .2 3  units.  all 1  unit picks all against betcris line at time of release. unfortunately pros/books have subscribed and built bots that move lines on release. we will have to stop selling picks very soon as not in best interest of subs.,280
mschwimer,in our 9  month history we have never had a perfect day with over 5  recs until yesterday. 7 -0 ! doesn't come close to making up for the worst week we had in jambos history (last week) but it sure is a start! go to  to learn more about what we do.,248
mschwimer,spoke w rufus on the phone. to clarify he subscribed to jambos during ncaab and saw some of those picks come in. he never unsubscribed but also didnt check the emails when he got them and therefore cant verify our record. he had all the means to verify but did not do so.,271
mschwimer,but the fund has been incredibly successful. first fund was  $ 2 6 m and took 8  months. second fund raised  $ 1 8 2  in 5  weeks. when you are successful people want to invest more. its how life works. knock on wood i have yet to do anything in business unsucessfully.,269
mschwimer,yesterday was  last day of giving our free picks to everyone. today is first day to buy packages. 1  week gets 5 0  recs. cost  $ 2 5 0 . get  $ 3 0 0  (including fee) back if our recs dont beat the market! bringing full transparency and financial accountability to you,269
mschwimer,i dont mind you coming after me for being a bad phillie. by any mathematical standard you would be correct. i wasnt very good. but what we provide for minor league players is the thing i am most proud of in my life. giving a voice to people who have none. please research.,272
mschwimer,exactly! books make money by evening out the line. jim murren (ceo of mgm) is a good friend of mine and we talked about this in person. no book has quants that determine where a line should be. only where a line is to get equal action. they all want to mitigate risk,266
mschwimer,clv is extremely over rated. i know its what everyone in the industry uses but i firmly disagree. if the sports betting market were a fair market i would agree. but its not even close to a fair market because books dont take big action anymore. we use our model edge  % .,271
mschwimer,hahahahahahahaha. all people of the twitterverse please look at this. if you want to see bs in the subscription space look no further. they call us out then when asked to put money where their mouth is they all the sudden are too busy to spend a couple minutes to get it done.,276
mschwimer,yes sir! we believe in what we say and we back it up with our own money. that is the only way to separate the real players vs. the all talk players. i have heard that  is real. but actions speak louder than words. we will see if they believe what they say.,256
mschwimer,our full record can be found on .  as of this moment we have made 2 7 4 7  recommendations and are +2 2 8 .0 7  units.  records are mis leading because we take a lot of dogs.  but it is 1 4 7 4 -1 1 7 5 -9 8 .,209
mschwimer,it happens. certainly not our record. you can check our daily history. i think we had 6  losing days in a row at one point. all about sample size. over 2 6 0 0  recs we are well over 2 0 0  units up. you can check everything for yourself on our website!,253
mschwimer,message to  subscribers. we had f5  under in nats vs. dodgers. also dodgers -1 1 2  for the game. we posted a team total of nats over. we obviously meant under but we will not change the pick because the game started. so if nats tt goes under it will be a loss,260
mschwimer,great news is on  you can do both!  you can track all our public picks and you can see our audited record. up to you which one you want to look at! either way both are great. also will soon add a feature where we score our picks based on pinny lines only!,255
mschwimer,our auditors go over how we score everything. they have procedures to check our scoring to make sure we do not score incorrectly. i want to know how they would score that game. that way we do not have a discrepancy. what we know is from now on we use fanduel scoring rules.,273
mschwimer,in future you should get the facts and information before making those types of comments. signing up is free for everyone. everyone can see what we do. we are the 1 0 0  %  polar opposite of touts. our lines and records are independently verified by a top 1 0  national accounting firm.,286
mschwimer,we release our picks and instantly send an email to our subscribers. our picks include the line and book we got the line from. we grade off the picks when we send them out. imo you should just pick a system and stick with it. just be consistent or the record is unreliable.,273
mschwimer,"yes! you have 2  options.
1 . listen to the jambos podcast which can be found on itunes spotify and google play. 
2 . watch espn show daily wager. less in depth than the podcast due to tv time constraints but still good info. i am usually on 3 -4  days a week.",260
mschwimer,"for my new followers. listen to the 5 min podcast which explains my plan to revolutionize the sports betting industry.  
ncaab season record is 7 9 9 -5 6 7 -2 3  (5 8 .5  % ) (+1 6 7  units nits).  independently verified by a top 1 0  nationally recognized accounting firm.",274
mschwimer,great move by the phillies. we rank realmuto as a top 1 0  player in baseball (rankings include position weighting). for reference we rank him higher than bryce. sixto could be a beast. even if so its a good move by philly. love some of the moves this new front office is making,278
mschwimer,if mlb bans the shift it will be a terrible decision imo. i do agree that the game has problems that need to be fixed. need more balls in play and shorter games. lots of creative solutions available. banning shifts would be like putting a bandaid on that only sticks for 2  minutes,281
mschwimer,not a fan of any of the teams in question. pure math here. georgia should be the 3  seed in the football playoff.  the spread in a clemson/georgia game would be around 3 . instead clemson/notre dame is 1 1 .5 . committee making emotional decisions that are not supported by math imo.,283
mschwimer,"2 /2
will also lead to much faster game.  my estimates have the game being shortened to 2 :3 0  min on average. 

i admit it is a major change and one that has no chance of becoming a reality. however it makes the most logical sense imo when compared to other alternatives.",273
mschwimer,i can promise the answer to that question will become very clear by the end of the year but you are thinking about it to simplistically imo.  bottom line it is not hard to beat the money you would get from betting a good model because the market is extremely illiquid right now.,278
mschwimer,how much would you charge if i made you watch every show?  fwiw i have given 4 2 4  daily wager recommendations and those plays are +4 3 .7 3  units.  and those plays are almost all vs. near closing line at caesars as the show is live from 6 -7 pmet.,250
mschwimer,we dont post good or bad free thursdays. we post all weekly props though. our total prop record in 3  weeks is 1 6 -8 . can verify for yourself. podcasts are short. we are 1 -1  in game of the week. the loss was tweeted about just like the win was.,248
mschwimer,our research indicated that cris over tens of thousands of plays was the best book to use for the market consensus in the us.  we tested several books.  i know its not a us book but the goal was to find that book that provided the best market consensus in the us.,263
mschwimer,1 /3  i appreciate all the jambos feedback. biggest question was the legitimacy of the  $ 1 0 0 0 0  guarantee. we are working with capital one bank to independently verify our total liability and confirm there are enough funds in our bank account to cover all guarantees. eta next week.,287
mschwimer,the worst of the worst. fwiw my goal is to get as much media attention as possible in order to get subs swag from these clowns. then when we are moving lines too much and no advantage to sub we get out. but people like vegas dave and others will be destroyed.,259
mschwimer,"man you must think we are the greatest cappers of all time if from the beginning lines will jump like crazy. thank you!

fwiw i agree.  this business model is not sustainable.  the market will catch up when we cant beat the close we will shut it down.  very small window here.",276
mschwimer,i dont know why this is so hard to understand. the reason i am doing this is because the tout industry is the worst. transparacy and financial accountability are needed in the space. if i provide it the others will have to or they will fail. at least that is the hope.,268
mschwimer,you dont think bill and ed are running away? i have agreed to every single term they have said so far. i have told them i will put our money up front in an escrow if their choosing. yet they are too scared. only logical explanation is they know they are wrong.,260
mschwimer,if you think clv matters then you should absolutely sign up for our service and not take a single pick. if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . when you are wrong you lose 3  thousand . seriously why on earth wouldnt you do this if you believe in clv,251
mschwimer,ok. so at the end of the day you think we will be positive units. regardless of how we get there you believe we will be positive. if thats correct then you should use our system correctly and play all our recs. you are guaranteed to be profitable after paying our fee.,268
mschwimer,all my advice is tournament advice. strategy is to be top 1 0  %  or last.  in this case we were last. however this is the 4 th time i did dfs advice and 2  of the 4  i came in top 1 0  % . as always its about sample size.,222
mschwimer,rhett - a statistical analysis of betting games in a similar format to what you mentioned win less than 5 2  %  of the time. meaning your comment does not make mathematical sense. capping markets (where money is bet and how lines move) does not beat the market in the long run.,277
mschwimer,we were offered an ownership position in a major sports team and we turned it down because the deal terms were changed at the last minute.  we still have several options on that front though.  just going to take time.  probably wont be done in 2 0 2 0  but never know.,268
mschwimer,yesterday marked 1  year of  releasing picks to the public. we had 4 4 1 7  recs and were +1 0 0 .1 5  units .  in sports with 1  full season of recs we beat the market in nfl mlb and ncaab but lost in ncaaf. click link for detailed analysis.,242
mschwimer,several things wrong with this.  you say you asked for the report and we didn't provide it? we have provided the cohnreznik report to everyone who has asked for it.  please show any evidence that you reached out and we did not provide it.  or please take that false claim down.,277
mschwimer,jambos has just finished 6  weeks of selling picks.  9  packages have ended.  subscribers profitable after fees in 7  of the 9 .  full details with  $  are below.  last day to sign up for this weeks package the 4  week package and the 1 7  week package that begins today!,271
mschwimer,if someone didnt buy week 1  and then bought the 4  week package they would be losing money. which is why we reimbursed them  $ 2 0 0 0 . jambos lost  $ 1 1 0 0  per package bought. when subs lose. we lose. which is how it should be.,233
mschwimer,not sidestepping. will answer that question at length and in great detail. it requires a conversation with a leading expert in the field. i believe jeff is perfect for that. because a lot of people have a lot of respect for jeff. when jeff agrees with me maybe they will listen.,278
mschwimer,"correct. hundreds of people have been following our picks from that time. they are interested in those numbers. that is why we post both. again everyone can pick what they want to count or not count. its why we keep everything up on our site. 

gotta get back to work. bye!",273
mschwimer,needs to be an interaction. must first show that they are jaded by their priors. i simply ask them questions. they will answer honestly. and they will come to the conclusion on their own that what i am doing is beneficial to our subscriber. they cant not. they are logical people,279
mschwimer,i only ask because i would personally love to have a conversation with them. if they really want to talk about it i am happy give them a piece of my mind. what these guys are doing is beyond awful imo. a reason you dont want to name them? just curious.,252
mschwimer,i made an assumption based on him explaining to me that he scrapped our site. i want to be clear that he did have all the means to verify if he wanted to. which is a big difference to actually verifying which he did not do. i apologize for the confusion.,254
mschwimer,unit size will remain at 1 .  we use all betcris/bookmaker lines to judge our plays.  guarantee has nothing to do with the subscriber.  just as long as betcris/bookmaker has the line up at the time we place the bet and subs can get  $ 3 0 0  on the rec.,253
mschwimer,all bets count as 1  unit. if we end up being negative units. meaning if we give you losing recs we will give you a total of 2  thousand  back. we do not feel its right for our subscribers to use the package properly and lose without us losing as well.,252
mschwimer,"shit. took me 3  days. but this is the first thing i said that wasnt true!  damnit. i had a great streak going. 

yes i was informed via text that that transaction is not publicly filed and can therefore not be verified. 

it is still 1 0 0  %  true though.",257
mschwimer,would it help if  and  would tell you that the guarantee is good?  remember. this money is in an account. we will not accept subscribers where our total liability will be more than what we have. period. we would need about 1 0  thousand  subs and i think that is unlikely,271
mschwimer,"im in 1 0 0  %  agreement w kelly for optimizing bet strategy. by far the best way to do it. 

but number one goal is not to look like a shitty tout. dont want to be down 4  units and make a 5  unit bet to try to save myself.",225
mschwimer,now that is simply not true. roughly 1 0 0 0  and been going at it for more than 6  months. literally not a single word from any of them that this was an issue. and we had  on it. if anyone would have an issue it would be him haha.,231
mschwimer,"person a- (makes bold statement)

person b- calls bs. says a is a fraud

a- gives b +2 3 0  odds on any amount b wants. puts money up front. 

b- goes missing and offers no explanation at all as to why he is declining the bet. 

who is the fraud?",246
mschwimer,not attacking. just stating simple facts. they called us out for being bs. i said prove it. put your money where your mouth is. and they went and hid in a corner. those are just the facts of what happened. we put our money where our mouth is. they wont. period.,261
mschwimer,still 1 0 0  %  true. what angle are you referring to? please be specific and professional. new policy to not respond to vulgar tweets. but will respond to any and all serious tweets with questions. in and out of media engagements all day. but will 1 0 0  %  respond!,267
mschwimer,that is correct. i dont think they will. i have proof of this. we have been around for 6  months. free to everyone. lots of big players subscribe. lines have not moved too much. all i can go on is my experience. but over time they most certainly will. i agree.,260
mschwimer,i agree completely! it is not a sustainable model at all. but it takes a lot of time for people to believe. probably a year or 2 . when that happens lines will move and we wont be able to give advantages to our subs so we will shut it down.,240
mschwimer,extremely hard to explain in 2 8 0  characters. sports bettors think everything revolves around closing line value. so if you put a play in at -3  and it goes to -4  they think its a good bet. i disagree. i think it matters slightly but other things matter way more.,266
mschwimer,"so then put your money where your mouth is. 

you claim you have more than 5 0 0  thousand  of people wanting to back it. what exactly are you waiting for? all the rules are spelled out very clearly on our site. do you have a problem with any of them?",251
mschwimer,thank you. it does not. reason is because we want to be the opposite of touts. dont want to be in a situation where we are -7  units and last game of the week we get accused of making a 8  unit play to catch up. everything 1  unit for us.,238
mschwimer,yes. i see that very clearly. as i said there was no perfect answer. if i did it the way you suggest then i lose 3 rd party verification which you know is critical. or our subscribers become upset with me and feel as if i am not listening to them.,247
mschwimer,people have told me their site allows action regardless.  however i checked with 2  us books and they agree with what you said.  i will go back and look at each pick that was made before a pitching change was announced and make those no bets. thank you for the help!,266
mschwimer,question to all the vegas bettors out there.  for 1 1 amet/8 ampt start times for ncaa basketball games how do you get bets down on those games?  do certain books open early? do you put them in the night before? or are those games just never available to bet?,259
mschwimer,simple answer.  we believe that over time our picks will beat the market and therefore creating value for both our subscribers and jambos.  however if we can't we want to be in financial alignment with our subs.  it is not fair for them to pay for picks that lose imo.,268
mschwimer,thank you!  please do not expect 5 -0  days to keep coming.  i have been on the show for 7  months and this sunday was my first perfect day of 5  picks or more.  that said i do have a winning record (including juice) overall! all about long term value.,252
mschwimer,1 /2  big news! jambos set up an escrow account with capital one. they will independently verify that we have enough funds to cover our total liability updated weekly as our liabilities change and we will post a bank letter from capital one to our website under the faqs section.,279
mschwimer,if you said no one is claiming i am a fool then you need to re read the twitter comments haha. either way i believe you are mistaken and i believe that if we had an on air discussion the vast majority of the listeners will agree with my pov.,241
mschwimer,correct. again if they can get 5 0 /5 0  action on both sides they would love it. when someone would love a certain scenario i consider that to count as a type of a goal for them. maybe problem was in communication and you think of the word differently?,253
mschwimer,then why are we up over 1 3 7  units over 2 0 0 0  plays that are only mlb and ncaab (major games only).  are we the luckiest people on the planet?  or are their betters ways to judge a pick than clv that you are not aware of?,226
mschwimer,i believe  are true sharps. everything i have heard about them has been positive. its my issue with the tout industry as a whole. why wouldnt they be financially accountable for losing picks? we believe in our picks enough to back it up with our own  $ . they dont.,265
mschwimer,this is a prime example of why i need to go on bet the process. the good news is both  and  will know and understand the guarantee is 1 0 0  %  good. they will never say otherwise. they might doubt our ability to win though. which is totally fair.,247
mschwimer,all suggestions noted. will talk to counsel. anything that we do not change that you suggested i will make sure i have a reason for not including it. again thank you very much for the help. predicting outcomes of games is our greatest strength. ts and cs are clearly not!,271
mschwimer,"on the other hand you have been all talk and when it came to putting money up you were all the sudden ""too busy.""  my guess is you research us realize its a losing proposition for you then make up an excuse as to why you are not doing it.",238
mschwimer,either way you still have not answered a very simple question. if you believe what you say why wouldnt you get 1 0 0 + packages? we are giving you 2 .3 -1  odds!!!! it would be nice if just one time you put your money where your mouth is.,238
mschwimer,for the record. i know a lot of people that know ed from  have not heard a single bad thing about the guy which is incredible given the space he is in. i simply have a problem with the current tout industry because they are not transparent or financially accountable,266
mschwimer,so does that mean you dont we will beat the market? if so you are the  person that should sign up. put your money where your mouth is. if you are right you get 1 0  thousand  if not you lose 3  thousand . dont play any of our recs.,231
mschwimer,we are more than a  $ 1 0 0 m company with corporate governance. as im sure you know i cant give one of your friends money to hold haha. what if that person got hit by a bus? but they might let me put in an escrow. stay tuned.,226
mschwimer,again if you believe in what you are saying and you think we cant beat the market including juice then you should 1 0 0  %  buy! if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if wrong you only lose 3  thousand . why wouldnt you do that?,231
mschwimer,yikes. connor you clearly have no idea how this works.  is the host of the show. period. he does not decide who comes on the show and certainly does not have anything to do with twitter handle decisions. also im done texting during the nba finals. series is too good.,267
mschwimer,went 7 -0  yesterday including marlins ml +2 1 0  and baltimore ml +1 6 0 ! up 8 .7 5  units on the day.  feels good to break out of the biggest slump in jambos history with authority!!!  have 8  plays up on the site now.  free for everyone,240
mschwimer,for just about any record you can choose a start date and make the numbers look bad or good. at jambos we believe it is critical to discuss the full record of publicly verifiable picks.  but  i recommend you subscribe and see it all for yourself. make your own decision,269
mschwimer,purpose of releasing our picks and keeping flawless records is to educate the betting public into making better decisions when it comes to sports betting. i want to make it clear that we are not receiving any financial gain in any way shape or form by releasing our picks now.,276
mschwimer,i can tell you that it is 1 0 0  %  free for everyone.  we ask for email address so we can send you emails when our picks are in so you can verify all picks have correct lines at time we release.  again we make 0  from our site.,228
mschwimer,instead of tweet we sent emails.  so yes all picks could be monitored by everyone who signed up for the cite.  they can check their email time stamp with pick time stamp and line we used at the time they received the email.  1 0 0  %  full proof system.,253
mschwimer,podcast best bet in nfl record now 8 -5 -1  after 4  straight winning plays.  always fun to get hot in a tiny sample.  click the link if you want to know what our game of the week is this week.  plus 7  props for the ravens/jets game tonight!,242
mschwimer,we switched aws servers 3  days ago.  i do not know definitively if that was the issue or not.  however my guess is one of the hundreds of subs we have would have brought this to our attention if it was prevalent.  again no way to know for sure.,245
mschwimer,"monster week for jambos.  especially in ! 

we are posting a lot of our ncaa football picks today before noon et.  if you want to see them sign up at  and get the 1  or 4  week package. must sign up today to be eligible for the weekly guarantee.",245
mschwimer,2 /2  in addition jambos has updated the ts and cs to make it clear that the money in the escrow account is only to be used for paying out subscribers if we cant beat the market.  i hope this eases the concerns about the legitimacy of our guarantee.,249
mschwimer,i have lots of thoughts and am extremely confident you will understand this. but twitter simply the worst platform. i have invited rufus to join my podcast. or i can join his. which ever he prefers. but its a fascinating convo. fyi. the gambling world unanimously agrees w rufus,278
mschwimer,you are missing that twitter is 2 8 0  characters. their is a reason presidential debates are not done via twitter. im happy to host you on my podcast if you would prefer. i have nothing to hide and am ready for the conversation. are you ready for it?,251
mschwimer,but i would still do this. reason im doing this is because i hate the tout industy. its the worst legal industry in the us in my opinion. they are not transparent or financially accountable. i want to give people that option and hopefully end up bankrupting those clowns.,271
mschwimer,i hope you guys are ready. im about to step this whole game up. got our general counsel to come in hot on twitter tomorrow to answer all legal questions!  unlike me he has tons of experience in the space. previously was gc at mgm. this will be fun.,248
mschwimer,i love it. if anyone should be skeptical its the gambling twitter world. im right with them. skepticism is great!  but when iv answered every single question and proved beyond any doubt we are legit then what? unless im missing something. is there an issue i have not answered?,277
mschwimer,while i really appreciate that. it goes against everything we stand for. i could do that and it would have a 5 6  %  chance to win. we are all about sample size at jambos. thank you for the interest though. register for free. get free picks every thursday!,256
mschwimer,he did not consult. rufus is a friend. we discussed the tout service as an industry and we both felt that all tout services are awful.  the main reason they are awful is they are not transparent or financially accountable for their recs. jambos not rufus built this system.,273
mschwimer,"no. if you are +1  unit you are profitable even after paying our fees!

this would all be so much easier if you would go to the website and read our detailed pdf on how this entire thing works. if we are negative units you get 1 0  thousand ",241
mschwimer,read up about our company. check out the sec filing. we raised  $ 2 3 m for jambos. a lot of peoples reputations are on the line. i dont know of a better way to guarantee payment. if you can think of a better way please let me know.,232
mschwimer,i have a correction to make. after internal audit the record i sent out was inaccurate. my best bet record is currently -2 .7 6  units in 4 7  recommendations. my overall recommendation record is +1 7 .1 6  units in 1 8 1  total recommendations (includes best bets).,266
mschwimer,whoa. instantly received an e-mail from a subscriber that says pinny 1 0 0  %  the best. he said pinny is better than cris because lines are tighter.  example. phils vs. marlins. pinny +2 1 7 /-2 3 8 . cris +2 1 6 /-2 4 4 . thoughts?,233
mschwimer,haha. im just getting used to this twitter thing. i wish we could use pinny and off shore books. we would be getting way better lines. unfortunately the vast majority of our subscribers are in the states so we must cite books in the states or vegas insider consensus.,267
mschwimer,yes. see the thread with rufus. i want to make sure we are consistent with our auditors. dont want to score it as a loss then they say its a win and wont verify or vice versa. have a call in tomorrow. they are 1 0 0  %  independent.,232
mschwimer,baseball is a great test case for isa. several companies are in it now. most do a really good job. but we have 1  bad apple that makes us all look bad. regulation is 1 0 0  %  required so the bad actors do not get into the space.,229
mschwimer,he wasnt even a rule 5  pick! i talked to several organizations when they asked my opinion on who they should select. grullon was always in the top couple picks for me. previous year franmil reyes was my top choice.  our model is incredible for undervalued rule 5  players.,273
mschwimer,"great question! our current models do seem to be heavy on dogs. a lot of it is seasonal. 

as our models improve and the season progresses i believe we should start to see more favorites being recommended. cant imagine a scenario where we recommend those more than dogs though.",277
mschwimer,"i have.  the problem is i want to be the opposite of touts.  touts will often rate plays with different units then justify it by saying ""i'm 7 5  %  in my x star picks"" and they just pick the times they are right in a small sample size.",236
mschwimer,just to be clear.  you believe a person betting their gut has a better chance to win than betting plays from a website that has 4 4 9 0  publicly verifiable documented plays that are beating the market by over 1 0 0  units.  do i have this correct?,248
mschwimer,that is our record vs. the betcris/bookmaker line at time of release.  i posted our record vs. the best publicly line available in us at exact same time of release.  please click the link i sent out a couple days ago for full explanation of our fully transparent record.,270
mschwimer,then how do you explain the performance of our live picks from that year matching almost exactly with the performance of the cohnreznik verified back test?  remember the 5 9 .3 8  %  was against opening lines against close we were almost identical to our live pick record.,272
mschwimer,depends how you look at it. i started daily wager in march.  jambos from when i started daily wager to now is +3 5 .1 8  units.  also at daily wager i mostly talk mlb and nfl which are the best sports for jambos results as of now.,230
mschwimer,no. not at all. want to be clear. our record since we started selling picks is downright embarrassing. no one at  is happy with the results. being +6  units in 6 0 0 ish plays is terrible. but that is completely separate from providing financial value to subscribers.,267
mschwimer,question to twittersphere. has a nfl team ever gone 6 -0  in their division and not win their division? i think the browns have a realistic shot at doing this. 2  vs. bengals. 2  vs. steelers. ravens at home. but will probably be 2 -5  after new england.,254
mschwimer,sure. subs would never buy 2  (4 week packages) as that would be overlapping weeks. makes 0  sense. either buy 5  (1  weeks) or 1  week and then a 4  week. or 4  weeks then a 1  week. in all 3  realistic scenarios subs are profitable after fees.,245
mschwimer,interesting note.  would love to have vegas dave or any other awful tout on his show. he would absolutely destroy them (i would love to listen as it would be incredible).  but when i ask to have a conversation on the pod he doesnt respond. why is that?,252
mschwimer,you then followed that by asking why we would post the best available book when our stuff was so good. you told me to use the market consensus and eliminate a reason for someone to complain. we took that advice and now post every single play against cris.,255
mschwimer,3 /3  for those who are new to jambos i appreciate your skepticism around the guarantee (i would have been too). i hope this will help alleviate your concerns. as always registration is free to all so you can see for yourself before deciding to subscribe or not.,262
mschwimer,has anyone else on this chain seen a single reason  wont make this deal? they claim they covered it before but i have yet to see a single reason. we have agreed to all their terms including putting our money up front into an escrow of their choosing.,250
mschwimer,this is very true. but most you can make is 4 -6 m per year. not nearly worth it for a company of our size. especially considering the additional people we would have to trust with money etc. it was a board decision to do it this way.,234
mschwimer,"check mlb record.  we now have on front page.  

mlb.  1 3 0 3  plays coming into today.  +3 6 .4 4  units vs. betcris at time we post.  +1 7 .3 1  vs. betcris closing line.  i guess we do get good clv.  that is very frustrating.",229
mschwimer,you can ask   he can verify that our record is 1 0 0  %  legit from 2 /1 2  on.  they continuously beat the market but the market doesnt move.  maybe we have just been that lucky.  if you believe that you are the  person that should subscribe!,243
mschwimer,not disparaging  at all. i have said multiple times that they are the sharpest group around. have nothing bad to say about ed and the others their. they called us out. i then offered +2 3 0  and our payment up front. then they went silent. thats all.,250
mschwimer,i appreciate you stepping up for us!  but that is not the reason at all.  no counter party risk at all.  unless people believe my entire gp will risk breaching the contract and breaking the law.  if you know my gps you would know that is an impossibility.,255
mschwimer,i challenge  or  to take  $ 1 m in action as a max per play. i will make 2 0 0 0  plays over a 1 7  week period. min bet 1 0 0 0 0 0 . will you accept? sports are nfl ncaaf ncaab and mlb.,187
mschwimer,do you believe a single word you say? if so you would have bought 1 0 0 + packages. or are you still ignoring that? dont worry you will see tv clips soon that call you out for not putting your money where your mouth is. stay tuned!,231
mschwimer,that is part of our ip. but the general answer is how the game is actually played. what factors matter. what factors you got right and wrong. its about the process not the result. if your process is right the results will come over a large enough sample.,254
mschwimer,we realize all of this. yes. we have enough to fund more than 2  thousand  packages right now. if we need to raise more we will. but i highly doubt it because people like to chirp. but they dont like to put their money where their mouth is.,240
mschwimer,now that is what im talking about! finally someone that understands sample size. for us to have the record we have over as many picks as we have we would need to be lucky on more than a 1  out of 1 0 0 0 0 0  scale.,215
mschwimer,correct. i believe the sports betting world gets this wrong. trust me. i have had many long convos w sports bettors about this. they all think im crazy. but its simply not a true market. so normal economic rules do not apply. again this is my personal opinion,259
mschwimer,we firmly disagree with that comment and its a lot messier.  we believe we can make a lot more money by doing this than betting ourselves. if a book guaranteed us  $ 1 m limits on every bet we wanted we would do that 1 0 0  % ,226
mschwimer,going to watch a show with the wife. if  believes the tweet they wrote ill wake up to a minimum of 1 0 0  subscriptions purchased. if not the people on this thread will know they dont actually believe what they say. ill update you in the morning.,246
mschwimer,then you should buy 1 0 0  packages and not place a single bet. wouldnt that be great odds? we do way better in the more liquid sports. for example we do much better in ncaa tournament and big conference than small. all recommendations are on our site.,252
mschwimer,in order for us to make the guarantees we are making we need sample size. the more games we recommend the less likely we are to lose. which is why we combine all sports in our packages. however we will look into sports specific packages as we progress.,252
mschwimer,"the  paid tribute to tyler skaggs by throwing a combined no-hitter against the mariners in anaheim.

the last time there was a combined no-hitter in the state of california? orioles-a's in oakland on july 1 3  1 9 9 1  - the same day tyler skaggs was born.",256
mschwimer,also really important fact. if we were able to use pinny lines we would be doing way better than our record. but our subscribers want us available lines only.  proving again that we do not do things to boost record but rather give our subscribers what they want.,262
mschwimer,no. vegas dave could not. does vegas dave have a top 1 0  nationally recognize accounting firm review his record? no.  does he cite where he gets every line so people can check to make sure his lines are not fake? no. we literally do the exact opposite.,253
mschwimer,this has nothing to do with being on either side of the bet. i had no action at all on either side. its about doing the right thing vs. doing the easy thing. vegas books do it the easy way. nj books do it the right way imo,222
mschwimer,"correct for vegas books. nj books are different. fanduel graded the over and the cardinals as winners. it is in their rules. google fanduel baseball betting rules and you will see. 

really needs to be an industry standard on this and fanduel is by far the most logical.",270
mschwimer,this has been a fascinating discussion. i believe fanduels ruling is by far the most logical and makes the most sense. however it is clear that is not the industry standard. i will go with the middle of the road answer and just make both plays no action.,254
mschwimer,"short answer. no. happy to win 3  best bets in a row though!

reminder. our best sport will be football. our basketball stuff was great. mlb should be able to beat the market but by a lot less than the other sports. all according to our internal analysis.",255
mschwimer,we are now 1 9 -4 -1  ats since we started doing free podcast picks.  while this is obviously unsustainable it feels good to be hot! plays available to the public on  are now 2 2 7 -1 7 1 -1 1 .  5 8 .7  % !!!,209
mschwimer,my 2  cents on astros situation. cheating with steroids gets you 8 0  games. imo knowing what pitch is coming gives players a much greater advantage than steroids therefore punishment should be much worse. i would go with 2  years for all players that used technology to cheat.,277
mschwimer,no problem. the big problem we face with displaying records is people want different things. most want when our picks were publicly available. others want from when we started selling. others want from when models were ready.  so we keep all 3  very clearly on our site.,270
mschwimer,this is a very fair point and one that i 1 0 0  %  agree with.  we have only done this for 2  months. i believe that if we continue with our companies 4  pillars - integrity honesty transparency and accountability trust will be earned over time.,245
mschwimer,if i was trying to say that jambos has a better roi for a subscriber than if they invested in the stock market what calculation should i use? obviously the calculations need to be the same to compare apples to apples. which is profit/amount invested quite obviously.,266
mschwimer,you and rufus are always welcome to come on the jambos podcast. i will answer any and all questions either of you have. i think it is important for our subscribers to hear things from all sides.  i have nothing to hide. full transparency always! you in?,253
mschwimer,last weeks podcast we gave out our game of the week (jags) winner and 8  props for the thursday night game.  went 5 -3 .  this podcast has our gotw as well as 8  more props for the jags/titans game.  tune into our 1 5 min podcast!,230
mschwimer,as i mentioned all questions and points can be answered by   anyone with questions can simply use that outlet.  this is way more of a back and forth type of conversation.  all will become very clear on a podcast why it simply can't be done on twitter.,251
mschwimer,meant. point. great correction. did you stop getting the daily emails when picks were in after that point? i hadnt noticed you unsubscribe to the picks emails? also i take back that you watched like i hawk. i said that knowing you scrap our site. my bad.,254
mschwimer,that literally makes no sense at all.  if the market does not believe we have an edge that means the lines wont move.  if the lines wont move the majority of our subs will be able to bet at our number.  do you disagree with this comment?,237
mschwimer,"responding to previous comment even though i hate doing it. 

im already very rich. i can retire and never have to work a day in my life. but that wouldnt be fun. you can verify this! look at our company valuation. i own 5 6  % .",229
mschwimer,we had a talk a while back about why she charges as she definitely doesnt have to. she brought up a great point. people dont stick to free work out plans. but when they pay for it they usually stick with it. it makes sense to me.,229
mschwimer,"correct. bernie madoff broke the law and is in jail. 

the deal is on our website for all to see. our guarantee is right there! if we break that then we are in breach. period. also false advertising. we would be breaking the law on multiple levels.",248
mschwimer,fyi we raised enough money  $ 2 3 m which is publicly verifiable.  just google jambos sec filing.  we will not accept any subscribers that go over what we can cover financially.  that would be horrifically irresponsible.  or we would raise more money before taking additional subs,280
mschwimer,how can you possibly get a better bet than 2 .3 -1  odds. you have yet to come up with one single reason as to why you wouldnt take this. it makes no logical sense. unless of course you dont believe a word of what you say.,222
mschwimer,if you dont think we are winning bettors then you must sign up! if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if not you only lose 3  thousand . no logical reason not to do it other than you dont believe what you are saying.,219
mschwimer,"no.  our units include juice.  for a -1 1 0  bet if we win we win +1  units.  if we lose we lose -1 .1  units.  

if you think we will be positive units that means you think we will be able to win money including juice.",219
mschwimer,at  we have far more people in nj than vegas. in nj more than 8 0  %  of dollars bet on the game didnt follow vegas rules.  also i guess its how you define industry standard in the us.  by industry standard do you mean only vegas?,230
mschwimer,then your book is a joke. score is 4 -4 . it cant be a loss.  im hearing from multiple people that suspended play in this situation means the action carries over. meaning the over is a win and we will see how the game plays out.,228
mschwimer,i genuinely believe the astros aaa/aa combo team would not finish dead last  in the mlb if they were the 3 1 st team in baseball. brought this up to a front office exec who said he thought they would finish better than marlins os and tigers.,241
mschwimer,this is so classic.  when we go 8 -2  in best bets earlier in the year  is no where to be found.  but on a cold stretch the chirpers come out of the woodwork.  i think i might change my twitter bio to just say sample size,221
mschwimer,i agree. it did! we did win 5  straight days. we also have been destroyed last 2  days. both things can be true. if you have taken all our recommendations from the beginning you would be winning money right now. all about long term and sample size.,248
mschwimer,tough  loss on over 8  runs in mets game. ended up scoring 7  runs and left a combined 2 5  on base!  also rockies blowing a 7 -5  lead w 2  outs in the 8 th. sometimes thats how it works. sample size sample size sample size.,225
mschwimer,i just want you to tell your followers the truth. it might be a good thing to simple admit that others can be really good at this. just my 2  cents. again im really happy you signed up and hope you are doing well with our picks!,228
mschwimer,someone wants to bet today.  they are smart enough to realize their own picks wont win in the long run.  they want to find picks that can have the best chance to beat the market long term.  where would you recommend they look to find those picks?,246
mschwimer,because our audience is mainly us based and they only have access to us lines.  yes we could definitely do best available world line and we would most likely be over 2 0 0  units because of 1 0  cent lines instead of 2 0  cent lines.,233
mschwimer,"when i post records and say ""all publicly available picks from betcris at tor"" i am only referring to individual picks that are all shown on the site.  not just the record.  my weekly tweet includes only picks that are all individually listed on our site.",255
mschwimer,how hard is it to understand? the point of jambos subscription service is to provide financial value to its subscribers.  we are currently doing that.  although we are also currently losing money doing that.  remember our subscription service is roughly 1  %  of what jambos is.,278
mschwimer,if jambos' picks are adopted by sharp bettors en masse it will be the global mkt mover for a  $ 5 0 0 b industry accd to ceo and  daily wager contributor  it could also trigger rapid line movements and change the face of sports betting.,236
mschwimer,correct. everything should be calculated as a +\- for the subscriber. at the end of the day the goal of jambos is to be the first subscription service to give +ev to subscribers. right now even if our picks lose subscribers win  $ . just facts.,244
mschwimer,well. my argument will be 1 0 0  %  factual. wont have any opinions. just pure scientific facts. i choose to believe the majority of your audience will understand that. but if you disagree i would believe you as you know your audience better than me.,250
mschwimer,curious  what specific touts have reached out wanting to be on the pod? its hard for me to imagine those guys wanting to be on your show. you both would instantly expose them and anyone that would be listening that subscribes would most likely unsubscribe. right?,263
mschwimer,"what doesnt add up is we are simply that good. but just saying that makes me sound like a shit tout. the problem is its the truth. 

i think the plan will be to go on a ton of reputable media stations and spread the word.",221
mschwimer,the way i see it is simple. why would you buy picks from a tout if they are not willing to back it up financially? its simply not right for someone to give out losing picks and not lose money themselves. its pretty simple to me.,228
mschwimer,update.  after speaking with our legal team they brought up a great point. very hard to adequately respond to questions in 2 4 0  characters.  please send all legal questions to  (contact) and i guarantee a response time of 2 4  hours from our legal team.,255
mschwimer,i believe market movement takes time.  the market has to realize how legit we are first.  if you are worried then sign up for the 1  or 4  week packages.   surely you dont think lines will jump like crazy in the first 4  weeks do you?,234
mschwimer,wrong again.  as i said we will only take bets that subs can get  $ 3 0 0  on.  also they can do the 4  week plan.   $ 9 0 0  cost  $ 2 0 0 0  back.  includes 0  ncaab.  only mlb nfl and ncaaf,192
mschwimer,only a couple. and very small amounts. these are all academics. basically no experience in the sports betting world. some worked in sports. others pure acedemics. all they know how to do is predict outcomes of games. they know very little about the sports betting world.,270
mschwimer,my bad.  certainly do not want to be misleading in any way shape or form.  when someone registers on our website to get free picks on thursday and to see our track record.  all for free.  what do i call that person if not a subscriber?,235
mschwimer,i was asked to give a recommendation on a prop of who will have a better record. sox or yankees. i recommended yankees because i thought 6  of 8  position players were better on yankees. i drastically underestimated how bad the sox pitching staff would be.,256
mschwimer,to start our mlb edge is tiny. im expecting to be up roughly 3 0 -4 0  units over the course of the season. its by far our worst sport. imo nfl will be our best. then ncaa football then ncaa basketball then nba then mlb.,220
mschwimer,i want everyone to be able to get legit advice. current subscription services dont have the same incentives as their customers. if we ever did do a subscription service i would make sure our financial incentives were in complete alignment. which has never been done before.,273
mschwimer,ncaabb record against the spread 5 5 5 -3 8 0 -1 3 . 5 9 .3 8  % . up 1 3 7  units.  all verified by an independent 3 rd party who is a top 1 0  nationally recognized accounting firm.  for more info,198
mschwimer,fans should hold owners accountable. the profits they are making are skyrocketing. if a bad signing happens that should be a problem for the owners wallet. not the fans. fans should always root for getting the best players. money shouldnt factor in at all. 2 /2,261
mschwimer,i completely agree here. in general people have no concept of sample size. this is a big reason i started this site to build a long term/transparent/publicly verifiable track record. post every day regardless of winning or losing. hopefully over time people will start to learn,277
mschwimer,we do many things.  mostly private.  from a public perspective you can see the press on our deal with metric gaming.  however currently we are keeping what we do on the down low.  by year end it will become a lot more clear to the public.,238
mschwimer,its a solid point.  i do not know how often they cheated and relayed the signs. put it this way.  any aaa or aa hitter that knew every pitch that was coming would be a mlb all star.  dont think anyone that played would think differently.,237
mschwimer,just an awful week and really skewed by sport.  our nfl went 1 0 -4  (+6 .6 2  units ) for the week. but ncaaf went 6 -1 1  (-5 .9 7  units ) and early season ncaab -1 1 .6  units  for the week,193
mschwimer,"bad news - just closed out an uninspiring week.  -2 .2 2  units. ugh.  

good news - ncaab season starts today with a monster slate!  today is the last day of the week to buy a weekly package at   and be eligible for the guarantee!",231
mschwimer,gotcha. yea the models really dont like josh allen. 2  biggest factors in productive qb play is accuracy and decision making. he is bad at both. he is a good runner and massive arm strength. but those things arent nearly as important. according to our,251
mschwimer,dear loyal twitter followers. i have done my best to answer all questions relating to jambos over the last 4 -5  days. please direct all future jambos inquiries to  and our social media coordinator will be sure to answer in a timely fashion. thank you!,252
mschwimer,for clarification in high school my friends always joked with me because they thought i wanted to be the king of the world.  as i am sure you know rex mundi is latin for king of the world.  i do not know about the comics.,221
mschwimer,scary thing is we actually have more than 1 5 0  with that edge. but wont be giving all those out as super unlikely for people to bet all those.  fyi. i fully understand that number is insane but its what the model tells us,223
mschwimer,you should ask  he has seen every play from the very beginning. and maybe you dont know what filing form d with the sec means. it means if we dont pay back myself and all my partners are breaching the contract and breaking the law.,231
mschwimer,"also we use the betcris/bookmaker line for all our plays. they are all time stamped so anyone can check to make sure the line is legit. and falsifying records would also be a breach of contract and we would be breaking the law. 

anything else?",244
mschwimer,if you actually believe this buy our system and take my money!  im giving you 2 .3 -1  odds!  but we both know you dont believe a word you say. and with that im calling it a night. been a long day at the office.,211
mschwimer,how does any of this have to do with the 4  week package younsaid you would purchase that doesnt involve ncaab. as i said previously. we will never put out a play where subs cant get down  $ 3 0 0 . ever ever ever.,214
mschwimer,yes. but thats not a flaw in my eyes. i know it sounds crazy but i genuinely do not care how many subscribe. i just want to provide a fully transparent and financially accountable option in a space that is littered with thieves and liars.,238
mschwimer,all packages start on tuesday. latest to sign up is 5 pm. i intentionally didnt include it as an option because i didnt want people inadvertently signing up for next weeks 4  week package when they wanted picks immediately. the packages resurface at midnight tonight,266
mschwimer,so when you said you would sign up to fade if we didnt have ncaab. then i gave you a 4  week package and gave you odds. did you actually mean you wouldnt at all and you dont mean a word of what you say?,202
mschwimer,not 5  thousand . we changed to 1 0  thousand . and its on a per subscription basis. if  wanted to do it. they would buy 1 0 0  packages. each with a 1 0  thousand  guarentee. meaning a total guarantee of  $ 1 m,211
mschwimer,they are their own people. they know im a big boy.  i dont need them to come to my defense. martin did. he didnt need to do that. he is a legit pro that owns a software company that sets lines. he tweeted a lot.,211
mschwimer,only way to get that info is to pay. or get from a friend that paid. thanks for signing up! please do not post our plays to the public anymore. as you know you are not eligible for money back if you post our plays.,214
mschwimer,"im looking forward to you answering my single question with a specific answer. 

iv built a system that requires zero trust in your end. we will our money in an escrow on your terms. give you 2 .3 -1  odds. why wouldnt you do this???",233
mschwimer,did i ever say he endorsed us? i said we both hate the tout industry. both of our biggest reasons for hating the industry is a lack of transparency and financial accountability. we are putting our money where our mouth is? but you are not.,239
mschwimer,our site has been free and available to everyone for more than 6  months. we have hundreds of subs. including many pro betters. if we were making it up after the fact dont you think we would be called out for that by now haha.,226
mschwimer,need serious opinions on what the best book to use for the market on collegiate sports. i have received overwhelming feedback that pinnacle is best market for pro sports but those same people said pinny is questionable in college. what say you sports betting world?,265
mschwimer,no. hard hit %  are facts in the way you are defining. it has a definition and is tracked. hard hit means any ball that leaves the bat at 9 5 mph or more. google mlb savant and have fun typing in players names etc.,214
mschwimer,yes. our subscribers have asked us to tell them where the best available line is. so that is what we do! we originally used 1  book for everything but got feedback from our subscribers that they wanted to know where to find the softest lines.,242
mschwimer,i signed a deal with espn to contribute to the daily wager!   our new venture is now out of beta  ready for the public! more details on . we'll offer free picks from march 1 1 -1 8  so you can see how it works!,210
mschwimer,no you do not have permission.  i will respond at length to the bs article you wrote that is littered with blatant lies and attempts to mislead your readers.  in my response i will post the report so the readers can see the truth.,230
mschwimer,in addition the 5 9 .3 6  %  claim was simply a fact.  that is what we did.  period.  we never said we could continue that pace.  in fact we made it very clear that it was extremely unlikely to continue at that pace.,216
mschwimer,which is why we time stamp all our picks and dont line shop. we only use betcris/bookmaker line at time of release. so if you line shopped you would be able to get better lines than what we post in the majority of cases.,220
mschwimer,this is exactly correct!  that is what makes us completely different than other touts.  with other touts a subscriber loses and thats it.  with our service we will pay you if our picks can't beat the market.  therefore providing the subscriber with financial value.,265
mschwimer,this is all correct! our public record of over 2 5 0 0  pick recommendations has proved we are the best publicly available pick recommendation service.  in addition we were also able to create a subscription service that provides financial value for our subscribers.,266
mschwimer,the last 2  games of the week were the browns on monday night and the redskins when they got baptized by the giants. lost by a combined 4 9  points! record now 2 -3 . not good. hope to turn it around this week!,210
mschwimer,of the 1 5  teams in the al the top 6  that use data analytics imo are rays astros yankees a's twins and red sox.  5  of the 6  in the playoffs.  it is no coincidence.  when will other owners in other sports learn?,214
mschwimer,its the exact opposites of what touts do. if vegas dave offered me +2 3 0  on identical terms im offering i would bet at least  $ 1 m into that. but no tout has ever backed picks up with money except for us.,207
mschwimer,i disagree with that 1 0 0  % . my business model is not sustainable. no way it can make that much money. its only good until the maket realizes we are the sharpest group around and we can no longer beat closing lines.,218
mschwimer,do you not understand what it means to file a reg d with the sec? plain and simple. if we dont pay the guarantee then we would be in breach of contract and would be breaking the law. maybe you should do more research.,217
mschwimer,we have far greater and much larger aspirations than a subscription service. our service will only last a couple years at the most. the world will catch on and we will become the worldwide market setter in all major sports. then the fun begins!,244
mschwimer,really wasnt patronizing at all. sorry if it came off that way. im being 1 0 0  %  serious when i say thank you. and would love to have an independent gambling 3 rd party look at all of this. genuinely appreciate the help,221
mschwimer,very simply. we will only accept enough subscribers that we know we can pay back if we lose. period. the money is here. its real. its in the bank.   its like me asking you how do you know mgm will pay a winning bet?,215
mschwimer,i think its a great suggestion. adds a lot more manual work on our end but i will strongly consider it. can tell you it wont happen quickly but maybe make it a separate package in the near future. thanks again for the suggestion!,229
mschwimer,after speaking to all necessary parties i have an official ruling about how we will score our recommendations on . this was one of those times where it was impossible to please everyone so i made the most logical and fair decision i could.,239
mschwimer,talk to any accountant. extemely strict rules. they look at each play individually. check to see if the line was available at the book that was cited. then grade results independently. its why touts dont do this. because legit accounting firms live on credibility.,264
mschwimer,1 st inning. votto on 2 nd. 1  out. puig hits a misile up the middle for what looks to be a sure base hit. but 2 nd baseman makes an insane play to catch the line drive and double up votto. tough beat,200
mschwimer,"also running hot over 1 5 0  games? how many games do you put out publically for free?

also check our record against closing lines. we are actually getting unlucky as we have lost a lot more half point games than we have won.",226
mschwimer,the model thinks gonzaga and uva are by far the two best teams in the country.  the model doesnt see any stumbling.  the eye test tells a different story.  eye test likes duke a lot more than the model does.  usually modeling beats eyes.,237
mschwimer,so much respect for what phillies ownership is doing. that said at bla we dont think bryce is a top 1 0  player. we actually like realmuto more considering position etc. still doesnt mean bryce isnt worth the  $  because of course he is!,237
mschwimer,interesting points. the ironic thing is advanced analytics show that strikeouts are turrible (barkley voice) for hitters. in fact its the most important thing a pitcher can do. problem is advanced analytics also show power is more important than putting the ball in play.,271
mschwimer,i apologize.  didnt mean where to go in terms of sportsbook.  i meant where to go in order to find best information on what teams to actually bet.  meaning would you send them to  to figure out what side to bet? or another site?,228
mschwimer,"cris is the benchmark because it is the best single book to define ""market consensus us line."" we tested several books and found that betcris best defined the us market line.  i agree math can be weird sometimes but it is our guiding light!",240
mschwimer,over the course of our very brief history we have provided financial value to our subs. that is an indisputable fact. other touts do not provide financial value to their subs. that is the difference. and those are the facts. not an opinion.,240
mschwimer,with sportsbooks having a great week and the average bettor getting killed jambos put together another winning week.  now 4  out of 5  weeks in + units.  today is the last day to subscribe at  to be eligible for the guarantee this week!,236
mschwimer,martin. its hard for them to understand. you have seen it. they havent. which is why my suggestion is to simply register for free and you can see it all for yourself. over time you will be able to understand what we do.,219
mschwimer,"false. as you can see from our bet history. we are roughly 3 5  units better at time of release than close. 

another thing. a big reason we dont get clv is we never bet opening lines. that is probably a big factor.",215
mschwimer,the money that is filed comes from the lps. we are the gp and take 3  and 3 0 . thats where the income stream comes from. we are in many lines of business. subscription company is the smallest line we are in.,208
mschwimer,"correct. we have a units calculator on our site. you put in how much you want to bet and it gives you the result of what will happen based on how we do. full transparency! 

we recommend  $ 3 0 0  per play.",206
mschwimer,because you might not be able to get enough down.  $ 3 0 0  is the key number. its what our payout is based on. its why if we are up just 1  unit you are guaranteed to be profitable after the fee.,196
mschwimer,doing the escrow for  because they said they would buy 1 0 0  accounts.  can't do it for each individual subscriber.  if you want to buy 1 0 + accounts i am happy to put it in an escrow for you as well.,202
mschwimer,"very sorry i missed these. 

1 . no. we hired a funny guy. in profile it was twitter is silly
2 . god no. im not close to smart enough to do what my team does. we have 2 5  people full time.",190
mschwimer,hahaha. that would be awesome. what if you wanted to bet  $ 1 0 0  on a game and mgm said they will pay you out before the game and trust they will get it back if it lost. that would be fun!,190
mschwimer,if those people of 1 0 + years think im full of it they can put their money where their mouth is. we are offering insane odds. 1 0  thousand  if you are right. 3  thousand  if you are wrong. cant beat that!,206
mschwimer,and 4  %  edge is our minimum. we average over 6  %  edge. after you do that math you will see the numbers we are looking at. that is the reason we are offering the package we are offering. makes perfect mathematical sense.,223
mschwimer,we use betcris as market consensus. you can see our record and all individual picks including how we do on closing lines on our website. go under cumulative record. scroll all the way down and click to see individual recommendations vs. closing line.,250
mschwimer,it means the money is good. if you think it doesnt mean our picks will be good then you are the  person who should sign up! you get incredible odds if you are right. put your money where your mouth is. we do!,208
mschwimer,all i can do is speak for myself and my record. on all recs i am +1 8 .2 9  units nits in 1 7 6  games. for best bet im doing much worse. +0 .6 9  units in 4 4  total recs.,172
mschwimer,appreciate it. ive known a lot of gamblers that base their decisions on ats trends. not won is a lifetime winner. only lifetime winners i know are people with models or inside information. not saying its not possible. i just dont know any.,239
mschwimer,i would like to officially lock in the phillies first 5  innings. yikes matz. talked about it today on  daily wager. around the 2 0 -2 5 min mark.  just dont listen to the next segment where i recommend first 5  innings tigers.,227
mschwimer,for all  subscribers. we posted a line for the vermont game at +1 0 .5  from draftkings. we have since found a bug in don best and draftkings so we revised the line to +9 . it is still a play on vermont.,203
mschwimer,exhibit a on why twitter sucks. jambos posts a thread tweet where we specifically say we are down 7 + units then in the next thread tweet specifically say (all results detailed above) and we still get called vegas dave.  be better,230
mschwimer,the face was because i cant watch the show when im filming and she mis spoke and said longest td 9 2 .5  yards. i almost fell out of my chair as i tried to get up and drive to wv immediately!,191
mschwimer,its ok. i give you complete credit for being honest and publicly admitting you do not want to debate this publcily because you know i will win. it really does show class and honor. i have a lot of respect for that.,214
mschwimer,i would say he has to prove he believes what he says. but that is just my opinion. again im more than happy if he no longer believes it and wants to take it back. would be no hard feelings at all.,196
mschwimer,i tweeted earlier. they felt 2 4 0  characters wasnt sufficient space. send all questions to  and i guarantee legal team will answer within 2 4  hours. and you can post answers on twitter if you want. we have nothing to hide.,225
mschwimer,and that same person made a public apology and paid a portion of our legal fees.  in his apology he said our business is great for minor league players.  can't find a single minor leaguer that does not love what we do.,218
mschwimer,if they tell me i can bet up to  $ 1 m per game i will do that 1 0 0  % . its a no brainer. unfortunately they wont. feel free to ask them why yourself. they wont tell me why.,175
mschwimer,subscribers can do whatever they want. if they want to play the recs great. if not no problem. zero conflict of interest as we are fully financially aligned with the subscriber. we only want to give our winning plays in every scenario.,235
mschwimer,sure. our record speaks for itself. we started this free for everyone 8  months ago. we have made 2 7 0 0  recs and are +1 7 2  units vs. betcris and +1 4 0  units vs. the closing line of cris.,193
mschwimer,i believe by aligning myself financially with our subscribers we are instantly more credible than any tout. including ras. but that is simply my opinion. you are certainly welcome to disagree. we trust our picks to back them financially. they dont. period.,256
mschwimer,but most importantly. if you really believe what you are saying then put your money where your mouth is. you get 1 0  thousand  if you are right and only lose 3  thousand  if you are wrong. why wouldnt you do this?,214
mschwimer,if you actually believe this why on earth wouldnt you sign up? if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if you are wrong you only lose 3  thousand . give me one good reason why you wouldnt do that?,197
mschwimer,no. what you bet doesnt matter. its all about how we do in terms of units. if we are negative units (which includes juice) you get 1 0  thousand  back. doesnt matter if you bet 0  or 1 0  thousand  per rec.,206
mschwimer,under records. click cumulative. then scroll all the way down and you see writing that says something like click here to see all recs vs. closing line.  i would send link but im not at my comp. should be easy to find.,217
mschwimer,if you care about sample size. my record on daily wager is +1 8 .2 9  units in 1 7 6  recs. almost exact same record for  which is up +2 1 5 .4 2  units in 2 3 7 6  recs.,170
mschwimer,we get all our lines from . all our picks are time stamped and we reference the book that had the line. the only way we would ever put in a bad line is if  published one. i will look into it.,191
mschwimer,we out of sample back test thousands of games. i am extremely confident we will be positive units (beating the market) at the end of the year. good sample for plays that you see is probably around 1 0 0 0 .,206
mschwimer,that was a bad loss. canning looked good. it was poorly capped. but your point does not make logical sense. unless you believe the tigers will be overvalued in every game they play this year because they are last in scoring runs.,229
mschwimer,after all the bad beats this week does  get the luckiest win in best bet history? over 2 7 .5  dame points. wins by a hook in 4 ot! in fairness he didnt take a -1 3 5  game like i did.,184
mschwimer,full disclosure. i sent espn my best bet when loyola chicago was +1 0 . but when the line moved to +8  they absolutely gave me the opportunity to switch it but i chose to ride. 0 1  is 0 -1 .,191
mschwimer,great question! for years gambling twitter calls out touts (rightfully so) for being dishonest with their records posting bad lines lying to customers. we come in and keep fully transparent records cite all our individual plays keep our guarantees with our customers.,267
mschwimer,no.  we build models to beat markets in every major sport to make a lot of money.  we have ways of doing that currently.  our website is just not one of them.  we do not make a single dollar from our website.,208
mschwimer,correct.  we make it very clear that we define market consensus line as the line at betcris/bookmaker.  always fully transparent about that.  we chose them because over a 1 0 0  thousand  sample size that line best represented the us consensus line.,249
mschwimer,podcast up a day early!  podcast weekly best bet is 6 -5 -1  and props are 4 0 -3 2  +5 .6 4  units.  we break down our game of the week as well as props for all 3  thanksgiving games!,184
mschwimer,the bottom screenshot is the real release.  i have no idea where the top screen shot is coming from.  do you have a time for when the top screenshot was taken?  the bottom is our actual release at 1 1 am.,204
mschwimer,i appreciate the kind words. the jambos daily wager picks have been ridiculously good. however you should go to  if you want a more accurate picture of how our model performs.  unfortunately it is much worse than our espn record currently.,239
mschwimer,not true.  the public has been able to verify all my pick recommendations that have gone into the numbers i cited.  all against betcris line. think about it.  imagine what  would do if we falsified any of our publicly available picks.,234
mschwimer,what we are looking to do is very simple.  provide financial value to our subscribers.  that has always been the goal of the subscription service.  which is why roi numbers are critical and will be discussed in the long write up.,229
mschwimer,weekly reminder that today is the last day to sign up for our weekly package! will release ncaaf picks today at 1 1 am et so sign up before then for best chance to get the line as we release them.,196
mschwimer,right. we do. im still not understanding why you dont want others to listen to our debates? shouldnt the people get all the information so they can make a decision themselves? right now they are getting all info from 1  side.,225
mschwimer,but the episode with rufus will be a 1  off episode that should hopefully discuss our different view points in a professional and civil manner.  i think it is important for all our listeners/subscribers to get different perspectives not just mine.,247
mschwimer,my recommendation would be to register for free and see for yourself.  we have free picks thursday so if you register you can get those picks and check to see if those lines are generally available at the book you use.,218
mschwimer,yet you refuse to bet on that. you call yourself a sports bettor yet you are getting +2 3 0  on a bet you think should win only 3 0  %  of the time. and you wont take it. mind boggling.,185
mschwimer,we recommend  $ 3 0 0 . but we have a units calculator on our site. type in the  $  amount you want to bet and a full range of outcomes appears. so you can see if its right for you,180
mschwimer,that is simply not true. please stop spreading lies. im not up nothing lifetime. im down a lot. im a historically losing bettor. legit have not won in a single season. but then i hired a modeling team and everything changed.,224
mschwimer,going live on  in 5  minutes or so to talk with  and  going to talk about how dirty the tout industry is and how  will change it. also call out touts who refuse to put their money where their mouth is!,201
mschwimer,i think  is the best in the business right now. and its so sad. they are not transparent and they are not financially accountable for losing recommendations. wouldnt you want a service that is transparent and financially accountable for losing recs?,249
mschwimer,yes. if we become the world wide market setter than our plan is done and we will discontinue our subscription service. which is why i think our plan has a very small shelf life. maybe a couple years? but who knows.,214
mschwimer,because we cant open hundreds of separate bank accounts. again we are backed by some of the biggest names in finance with impeccable reputations. please research bill miller (legg mason) marvin bush steve duncker and david ganek to make a few.,243
mschwimer,was a great day on the wager for my picks. not so much for my tv performance of having a brain freeze on indians starting pitching though. that was ugly. have no fear i will be back on dw on friday!,198
mschwimer,go to  and click recommendations.  we have 9  plays up today.  parlay any of those with thiem would be my recommendation.  also taking thiem -4 .5  games is a good play.  fyi  will ask you to register but its all free,217
mschwimer,dodgers havent been shut out at home in 4 2  straight games. all i need is 1  run for my best bet and i cant get it. nats and dodgers left a combined 3 8  runners on base!!!!! bad beat central.,193
mschwimer,you have also witnessed us taking more than 3 0  %  of possible pre game bets.  have you ever seen a record that is public that is as good as ours? im sure it does exist just havnt found it yet.,194
mschwimer,that is awesome! i had a host family in williamsport short season a. still talk to my host mom to this day. im not sure of any teams that do host families after a ball though. i would absolute encourage it!,206
mschwimer,jambos podcast is up! game of the week is 4 -4  -.4  units and thursday night props are 2 8 -2 2  +3 .4 8  units.  we have 7  props for tonight on the show in our props party segment.,183
mschwimer,this is a fantastic point you bring up.  i am planning a very long note tweet where i will explain where we are and where we are heading.  will 1 0 0  %  touch on what you brought up above.,189
mschwimer,enjoyed going on   podcast again.  was the  most listened last year and hope to regain that spot this year!  lots of exciting things happening with bla and jambos.  listen to learn about what we are doing and our future plans!,226
mschwimer,that makes sense. but has any tout ever asked to come on? my point is i feel like touts would never want to go on your show because they would be exposed. is my theory correct or no? just curious.,196
mschwimer,i 1 0 0  %  agree with the chart for all touts before we entered the space. before us no one has offered a money back plus guarentee. no one before us has been in full financial alignment w subscribers.,202
mschwimer,because  called us out for being frauds. trust me i wish it had been vegas dave or anyone else really. you might think what we claim is crazy but that is why we back it up with our own  $ ,188
mschwimer,ats. and sides. mls too. i think the highest we have done so far is +3 5 0  range and -4 0 0  range. you can check for yourself. all plays are available for all to see. free of charge.,184
mschwimer,im very curious to hear your take  you know the people i work with. you know the money is legit. question is what side of the +2 3 0  bet would you be on?  obviously no hard feelings either way.,194
mschwimer,please go on our site and use the units calculator! put in the amount you want to bet per game. if it doesnt make sense for you dont sign up! will be to hard to win and beat the fee,181
mschwimer,"a fraud doesnt put the money up to back up what they say. 

a fraud is someone who doesnt stand behind the words they say. this is unequivocally what you are. its just the facts. this is not an opinion.",202
mschwimer,"agreed!  cizzle deserves a gift. i tried to dm him but he is un dmable. 

so back to the point. why wouldnt you put your money where your mouth is? or do you not believe a single thing you say?",193
mschwimer,extremely familiar. and i think ed is great. everyone i know that knows ed says he is a stand up guy. i just hate the way the tout industry works. period. no financial accountability of transparency. its a true shame.,217
mschwimer,point is. we are going to clean up the awful tout industry by being full transparent and financially accountable for our picks. we put our money where our mouth is. if we give you losing picks we will pay you.,209
mschwimer,yes that certainly is!  its 3  thousand  per package.  so 5 0  thousand  specifically does not work.  4 8  thousand  or 5 1  thousand  will work!  lets do it!  i will follow you and we can talk on direct message.,212
mschwimer,we have a stop built in when we hit a certain number of subscribers. we would never accept any subscribers if we couldnt fit the bill if we lose. would never accept 1 0  thousand  people without raising additional money.,220
mschwimer,if you really believe that then why wouldnt you sign up? give me 1  good reason why you wouldnt sign up. if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if you are wrong you lose 3  thousand .,185
mschwimer,"amen! lets see it happen! they got scared and obviously dont believe in what they say. 

there is a new sheriff in town. if  is as good as you say why dont they guarantee money back plus like we do?",198
mschwimer,we have packages as low as  $ 2 5 0  for a week. only get  $ 3 0 0  if we lose on the week because its a lot more likely we lose in 1  week than 1 7  weeks.,156
mschwimer,id probably go w the 9 8  braves. although the 8 6  mets were absurd. id put those above the rest in only looking at last 4 0  years. didnt want to go way back due to mound height etc.,184
mschwimer,"has made over 1 0 0 0  mlb recommendations. see below for a detailed write up of our record how we would have done without picking best available us line and how we would have done vs. closing lines. 

enjoy!",208
mschwimer,im listening to our subscribers and giving them what they want. which is to know where the best line is available. also using scoring system that makes the most sense and is a big part of us dollars being bet.,209
mschwimer,no because then our subscribers will be furious with me. they want to know where to find the best lines. the majority of our subscribers are recreational betters with multiple apps. so they go on the app that i cite.,216
mschwimer,i understand and agree with that comment. it is exactly what i wanted to do initially but our accounting firm wasnt able to do it. they said we need to be consistent and only use one set of scoring rules.,204
mschwimer,just spoke w fanduel sportsbook rep. according to them both bets would still be pending. nothing official. so the over will win and the ml will be pending. they did say this is determined on a book by book basis.,212
mschwimer,are you serious? we use all lines that are available at don best. you can look at the line history. you wont find any that are inaccurate. my only hope is you are taking the plays and making serious cash!,204
mschwimer,its hard to believe our government is discriminating against an entire group of people because their brain chemistry is different than most. when has discrimination turned out well for americans? its like we refuse to learn from our previous mistakes.,251
mschwimer,to be clear.  are you saying that you did not find any issues with the games we posted or our record.  however you would prefer we post widely available lines instead of lines at betcris/bookmaker.  do i have that correct?,222
mschwimer,this is true.  for life standards i was incredible.  for mlb standards i was trash.  basketball will always be my first love though.  if i could only jump and play defense i could have played in the nba! haha,208
mschwimer,had 1  goal when started.  to provide financial value for our subscribers.  even though our picks are going much worse than we anticipated we are still achieving our goal. please understand these numbers are extremely volatile and change constantly.,249
mschwimer,im heading to bed. big day tomorrow. as always happy to have  or  on the jambos podcast.  i personally think the gambling world deserves to hear two professionals discuss in depth gambling content in a professional and civil manner.,232
mschwimer,if any tout wants to give me +2 3 0  odds on identical terms i provide i would love to bet that! except  i dont think it would be a +ev bet against them from what i have seen.,175
mschwimer,2 /3  capital one would independently verify this on a weekly basis as our liability will increase each week with additional subs. this escrow account can only be debited by jambos in order to pay liabilities to jambos subscribers.,231
mschwimer,then you dont know rufus. he was watching like a hawk and even scrapped our picks to make sure they matched up. he was the one giving us a hard time for using best available instead of market line.,197
mschwimer,how would you recommend marketing? i cant think of a single way to market ourselves and not sound awful. i really dont disagree with you. it does sound awful. if you have any ideas please let me know. seriously.,211
mschwimer,"their is ceainty!!!!

look up what it means to file a reg d with the sec. if we dont pay then me marvin bush david ganek steve duncker and several others are breaching the contract and breaking the law!!!!",205
mschwimer,you guys have no idea. almost all our subs are nyc quant hedge fund guys. that seems to be our biggest audience so far. i think they understand what we are doing from a modeling standpoint. but who knows.,204
mschwimer,i never said any of that!  rufus is a subscriber.  all of our picks were free to everyone that subscribed!  i have no idea if he is playing our picks or not.  you will have to ask him that.,189
mschwimer,i have not heard a single reason from you  why do you need to trust us if we put the money in an escrow account on your terms?  again have not heard one single reason from you. still waiting...,193
mschwimer,1 0 0  %  correct. that is why we are so different than anyone else out there. our models are that good. period. again you dont have to trust me. look at our play history. see it for yourself.,192
mschwimer,because they want to mitagste risk it leaves a huge opening for sharps. but they limit sharps. which means the market isnt fair. if anyone could be anything they want then clv is by far the most important thing.,211
mschwimer,working with the team on viability of setting up individual escrow accounts. stay turned. but bottom line is you should research the names i sent.  if i said warren buffet were backing it would you feel the same way?,216
mschwimer,ill respond again. because the market is not liquid. if you found a book that will give me  $ 1 m per game limit then i 1 0 0  %  would do that. unfortunately that doesnt exist right now.,187
mschwimer,so you are saying you dont want to invest 9  thousand  if you knew you were getting 1 0  thousand  back in 1 7  weeks? you do realize that is more than a 1 5  %  annualized return right?,186
mschwimer,my favorite thing about our system is its troll proof. the fact that you wont buy the package proves beyond a doubt that you think we will be profitable including juice over the entire nfl season. so thank you!,210
mschwimer,i should also add that our record before 8 /2 0  was against the best available line in a us book.  our record against the market consensus line at the time of release is +1 7 1 .6  units,187
mschwimer,"3  minor league position players that are significantly better than the mlb player ahead of them. 

1 . yordan alvarez over tony kemp
2 . deivy grullon way better than knapp
3 . bubba starling over gore and soler.",213
mschwimer,i wish i could take big action on even money that tua wont be the number 1  pick. hate how you cant play the other side. even if juice is outrageous still should be able play bet both sides.,190
mschwimer,thanks in large part to a monster nba month.  1 1 1 -7 1 -1  +2 9 .9 1  units .  now positive units for our publicly released picks in nfl nba mlb and ncaabb.  all 1  unit plays.,178
mschwimer,i have recommended 6 0 2  picks on daily wager.  those recs all 1  unit are +3 1 .8 3  units.  again these can all be verified as the show is recorded for anyone to watch and keep track.,186
mschwimer,part 1  comes out tomorrow! it will be sent as an email to all our registered users. not subscribers. so all you have to do is register for free and you will get it. it directly answers  questions!,197
mschwimer,listen for our game of the week. won w the saints last week (3 -3  overall) and our prop record currently 5 8  %  and +5 .8  units. 8  props on the podcast. all for the game tonight.,182
mschwimer,no need for odds.  the bet will push.  jeff and rufus are not interested in having a professional conversation about anything jambos related.  they have made that very clear.  invitation still available in case they change their mind.,234
mschwimer,the jambos podcast.  we were tiny during ncaa basketball season.  our first episode of this football season drops on thursday! can be found on  spotify itunes and google play.  we break down games with analysis from our models.,227
mschwimer,if you believe that can you name a reason that you wouldnt buy the package for 3  thousand ? if you are right you get 1 0  thousand  total. +2 3 0  odds. why wouldnt you do this?,178
mschwimer,"aka you are scared and dont believe a word you say. actions speak louder than words. facts are. 
i make statement. 
you say bs
i say ill give you +2 3 0
you say no

simple as that.",180
mschwimer,or 3 . we go on a bad run and we pay everyone out and i look like a complete moron!  will you be the one to take the money? or are you all talk and no bite?,156
mschwimer,we have backed up literally everything we have said.  i can 1 0 0  %  guarantee we will escrow that money.  our terms are simple and fair and can be found on our website.  you can review anytime.,195
mschwimer,this is not true.  we have 1  week and 4  week packages occurring simultaneously with the same picks.  so if we did that we would be losing to our other customers.  also we would never do this anyways.,201
mschwimer,see. i know for a fact you dont believe that. you believe we will crush the market. facts are facts. if you actually believe what you said you would sign up and take our money. plain and simple.,194
mschwimer,"start by reading our plan here 


then register for free. no need to ever pay. need to register to see our history. we have been free to the public and have made 2 7 0 0 + recs.",177
mschwimer,i fully understand why everyone in the betting industry believes that. i believe it matters. but not nearly as much as everyone else thinks. i believe more statistically significant factors exist. however that is part of our ip.,228
mschwimer,the money has been raised. check the sec filings. they are public. we raised  $ 2 3 m for jambos specifically. if we lose we lose. but we will 1 0 0  %  have the money to fund.,176
mschwimer,i agree completely. i highly doubt we get that many subscribers. people like to talk a big game but few will actually put money where their mouth is. if they are we will 1 0 0  %  fund!,185
mschwimer,but this is not for the  $ 2 0  bettors. would much prefer those people do not sign up because that would lead to negative ev after paying our fee and that is not what jambos is about.,184
mschwimer,also we dont get to line shop how one normally thinks to line shop because our subscribers want us only books. true line shopping would be international and you could use pinny and other cites w reduced juice.,209
mschwimer,official announcement.  will grade all its picks using fanduel sportsbooks rules. they simply make the most sense. even  can admit that if you announce how you are grading picks it can never be seen as typical tout grading,222
mschwimer,no argument from me on that comment. good news is al west is locked up and you can always find good bullpen arms at the deadline. dodgers system deep enough to make moves without losing too much future.,202
mschwimer,"you picked a hell of a time to start following us. 1 6 -4  in last 2  days. do not expect this to continue!

either way its great to hear from you! you still working the lv clubhouse?",183
mschwimer,definitely wiggle room. my advice to get the best line is put them in right when we send. lots of pros follow  so it is really likely the line moves the longer you wait. again these are generalities.,199
mschwimer,no one in baseball is swinging a hotter bat than the franimal. 4  homers in last 5  games. hard hit  %  exit velo and barrel %  are far better predictors than actual results like hits and home runs.,198
mschwimer,i just looked at all our picks and couldnt find a single example of us using a solo wynn line. can you provide evidence? thats why all our plays are available to the public so everyone can check.,195
mschwimer,today's podcast.  ironically we went 4 -1  yesterday on .  i didn't do a best bet on espn but if i did it would have been the one game i lost.  hard to come from behind and beat,177
mschwimer,for baseball stat heads i strongly recommend the  podcast.  most recently had a podcast relating to the predictability of pitching injuries.  unfortunately they got a few things wrong.  i am happy to come on the podcast to discuss!,231
mschwimer,awesome article today in  about former mlb pitcher  and his new initiative that could change minor league baseball forever... also he thinks he can predict which players are most likely to be injured... he's joining us next on,226
mschwimer,podcast up! our 4  game winning streak was snapped last week. now 8 -6 -1  for the season on our podcast nfl game of the week. listen to hear what we like in week 1 6 !,168
mschwimer,the reporter didnt have the same experience. in fact no one at  has responded to my question of who reached out requesting the report. but when you texted me asking for the report what was my response?,201
mschwimer,well then all i can say is you have heard very wrong.  everything in the above tweet is just flat out inaccurate.  but it is a free country and you can believe whatever you want to believe!,189
mschwimer,"websters defines roi as ""roi measures the gain or loss generated on an investment relative to the amount of money invested.""  that exactly how we calculate it. roi = profit/amount invested.  not profit/amount wagered.  pretty straight forward.",243
mschwimer,you will see it very clearly. i promise you. just needs to be part of a conversation to get the point across most effectively. i have nothing to hide from. twitter just not the avenue. thats all.,195
mschwimer,happy to answer any and all questions that jeff and rufus have on the phone. it requires back and forth as you will fully understand if they want to have a phone call to discuss this professionally.,198
mschwimer,you have my cell.  call me and i will explain.  too long for twitter.  it is all math.  i am available right now.  you can record the conversation and post if it to twitter if you want.,185
mschwimer,i have listened. i assumed the reason was because any normal tout would be wayyy too scared to come on your show. have other touts reaches out wanting to go on the pod? if so which ones?,186
mschwimer,i do address this. we use betcris/bookmaker as a market consensus line. we do not tell people to bet through them. please read the full detailed write up on the site. it addresses this issue very clearly.,204
mschwimer,think about it this way. in journalism would it is looked at as extremely unprofessional to write an article about someone without reaching out to them for comment. do you not think this applies for podcast professionalism?,223
mschwimer,we all know you dont actually believe this. if you did im offering you the greatest bet of all time!  why wouldnt you accept?  name 1  single reason besides you dont believe a word you have said.,195
mschwimer,precisely! if we talk about how good we are we get slammed. then we say if you dont believe it short us. then we get slammed for not talking about how good we are. gamblingtwitter is beautiful.,193
mschwimer,bottom line  if you believe one single word that you say give me 1  single reason why you wouldnt accept the 2 .3 -1  odds that we are offering you? just one reason is all im asking.,182
mschwimer,loyal followers. please check out the piece i did for real vision. 4 5  minutes on where the sports betting industry is now where  fits in and the future of media as it relates to sports betting!,195
mschwimer,have no fear. will be back on monday. todays plays will be up shortly. have lots of action. you can see everything i am on at . 1 5 sec to register and its free for everyone.,174
mschwimer,again all our individual plays can can found on our website so you are able to check and verify for yourself! thats why i created this system so if anyone was skeptical they can check for themselves.,199
mschwimer,not true at all.  please click the link and read.  would need to risk 3 5 .4 9  units in order to profit 1 0 0 .1 5  units for the year.  2 8 2  %  roi.,152
mschwimer,in case you missed our podcast we will be giving out all (a ton) of prop bets on the  twitter account for wild card weekend! will use only   lines and will count everything as 1  unit.,184
mschwimer,"with another bad week in the books jambos and i have been receiving a lot more questions.  please dm  (not my personal twitter) and i will answer your questions provided they are asked respectfully.  

thank you.",212
mschwimer,thursday podcast!  game of the week is tonight! tune in for some insights!  7  props as well.  4 -4 -1  in game of the week this year and 3 1 -2 6  +3 .0 8  units.,163
mschwimer,amazing what happens when you go to bed before twitter.  have no fear long response coming later this morning.  have espn daily wager from 9 -1 0 am.  i know you will all be watching! haha,188
mschwimer,no. we had hundreds of subs that have seen everything for themselves. realistically. if we did anything bs in terms of posting our record what is the likelihood no one would call me out on it?,192
mschwimer,"1 .  when you produce the type of returns i have been able to produce you can charge outrageous fees. 
2 .  again we raised money in nov for the gp at an extremely high valuation.",179
mschwimer,this i 1 0 0  %  agree with. as i have always said. the gambling would unanimously disagrees with me. but i have seen numbers that suggest otherwise. maybe people arnt looking in the right places...,198
mschwimer,we dont do team totals anymore. we posted a dozen or so of them. so highest correlation for paid packages is 2 . and correlation doesnt mean exact same. we have had a lot of splits.,181
mschwimer,this is why there is a shelf life for our stuff. which is why smart people will play our recs big time. haters will have to learn the hard way. its fun for me either way!,170
mschwimer,from public picks only. no extra games. our record in 4  week packages would have been 1 7 -5 . but lots of overlap there obviously. doubt we can continue at that pace but who knows.,182
mschwimer,but why would we want to go through that.  would mean we would be tied up dealing with frivolous things left and right. i think it makes sense. 1 0  thousand  is a solid limit imo.,180
mschwimer,here is the most important thing. that you still refuse to answer. if you think we will lose why would you put your money where your mouth is. we are giving you 2 .3 -1  odds!!!,177
mschwimer,he didn't sign up for reasons unknown.  he signed up in order to follow us and see how we do.  to make sure we are fully transparent etc.  he will be able to vouch for that.,173
mschwimer,if you dont believe me you can ask  or  just 2  of our hundreds of subscribers. rufus from the beginning and doug since march. they can verify we have never posted picks after games have started.,195
mschwimer,did you read his public apology letter? where he said we are a great option for minor league players and he dropped the suit and paid a portion of our legal fees? please do your research.,187
mschwimer,no one trusts what exactly? that we wont pay the money? we already offered  that we would put money in escrow in advance and on their terms. what else do you need to trust? im confused.,185
mschwimer,"major announcement!

i hired a full time social media coordinator to manage the  twitter account. if you follow our picks and want fun commentary give them a follow! (heads up- he is heavy on the gifs)",201
mschwimer,thats exactly how we do it. picks are time stamped by email and don best can be checked up to the second in their archives.  it is as accurate and transparent as possible. cant fudge it.,186
mschwimer,depends on payout structure and scoring parameters but yes i would take a lot more chalk.  in a pool like that usually picking the winner is most important which is why i would recommend taking uva!!!,200
mschwimer,i have great respect for  as a reporter/writer. however his story correlating velocity/likelihood of injury is flawed.  bla's research concludes that velocity and injuries are only mildly correlated.  biomechanics is major reason for uptick in injuries.,253
mschwimer,again we are not selling any picks here.  everything is for free.  no financial gain for us if anyone uses or doesn't use our picks.  just presenting facts and trying to educate the sports betting public.,204
mschwimer,we keep all our individual picks on our record tab so you can check on everything yourself to make sure it is completely accurate!  none of this information is behind a paywall.  free for everyone.,197
mschwimer,first i have immense respect for bills mafia. incredible fan base and great city. i lived their when i played for aaa buffalo. second everything we do is model based. it is not my opinion.,188
mschwimer,"step 1 . register for free
step 2 . go to records page and click cumulative record. 
step 3 . scroll to bottom to see how all plays did vs market line and closing line.",168
mschwimer,size bankroll is completely determined by how we do early on and depends on how much people want to bet. we have a units calculator for this. size of bankroll is determined by the subscriber.,191
mschwimer,once again. if you actually believe that why wouldnt you sign up and take my money? im giving you 2 .3 -1  odds! please give me one single logically reason why you wouldnt do that?,180
mschwimer,jambos isnt just a subscription service my friend. we have been offered equity in major sports teams. content deals. etc. ownership in major sports team will be announced in less than 4  months. stay tuned!,206
mschwimer,hahahaha. got it. that doesnt look great! but i can guarantee with 1 0 0  %  certainty it is not me. i have never had and will never have a twitter account other than this.,172
mschwimer,they certainly do exist. you are talking to martin now. also rufus and many more. again i have no idea if they are playing anything as i have no access to their personal betting accounts.,187
mschwimer,if you actually believed that you would sign up and take our money! but we both know you dont actually believe that. actions speak louder than words! we are giving you 2 .3 -1  odds!,182
mschwimer,you do the math. how likely is it for us to be +2 4 2  units over 2 7 6 9  plays if we have no edge? answer is more than 1  in a million.,137
mschwimer,its what our model says. unfortunately thats all i can say on that. other than we have been doing that for 2 7 0 0  plays over 8  months. our record speaks for itself imo,170
mschwimer,thats what our internal numbers tell us. best part is if you dont believe it you should sign up. if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if wrong. only lose 3  thousand ,170
mschwimer,happy to answer all those questions. even though if you spent just 5  minutes researching all those questions are answered. please just go to  and read our detailed write up. all those questions are answered!,208
mschwimer,why would anyone sign up for  when they can sign up for  if jambos loses we not only give you your fee back but give you additional money!  no logical person should pick  over jambos,182
mschwimer,nothing meant to destroy. cheetah has great insights and i learn a lot from listening to him. beauty of modeling is we all do different things. always more than one way to skin a cat.,183
mschwimer,thank you! time will tell on it being free. if we do end up charging it will be different than all other subscription services as we will be putting our money where our mouth is.,178
mschwimer,it is absolutely not industry standard and that is the problem. no industry standard at all. might be what happens in vegas but nj only books are mostly on the other side. we need uniformity!,191
mschwimer,unfortunately the real answer is roughly 1 0 0 0  plays. but lots of signs along the way that are more predictive than record. like closing line value and run differential on wins vs. loses.,190
mschwimer,y are people saying this is a great draft for the 7 6 ers? they lost 2 3  year old point guard who will be a top 5  pg in the league for 7  years.,146
mschwimer,the  twitter account will be releasing all our props at some point in the next hour.  i suggest you follow the account as these are very small markets and lines will move very quickly.,184
mschwimer,my recommendation would be to dm jeff or rufus with all your questions. if this happens i give you my word that i will answer every single question. even if it takes 4  hours!,175
mschwimer,"correct. the goal is impossible. but that doesnt mean it isnt a goal. 

i can honestly say i have a goal to win a nobel prize but its also impossible for me to achieve.",168
mschwimer,we were free to the public. they could verify every play we made was in time and didnt add extra etc. during the 6  month period we averaged 5 0 0 ish registered users.,168
mschwimer,"agreed w that chart 1 0 0  % !!!!

that is the reason i created jambos! that chart doesnt include money back plus! if it did it would show positive ev for the subscribers.",171
mschwimer,it should be identical. or extremely close. bottom line is we judge on our system. so if you get better lines and win and we lose you still get the guarantee. and vice versa.,174
mschwimer,"while technically correct. i see the word tout as someone who lies and isnt financially accountable for the picks they give out. if they lose they say tough luck

we are the polar opposite.",189
mschwimer,im stone cold serious when i say this. in 3  years you will look at this tweet and say holy shit. i said this to make fun of him. but it actually came true,155
mschwimer,we are on day 3 .  is still in hiding. have no fear  i will continue this every single day until i get a response. and will cover it in the media! stay tuned.,158
mschwimer,we answered all the will you get paid questions. look into what it means to file reg d with the sec. all my partners and i will be breaking the law by not paying.,162
mschwimer,if we lose 4 5 0  consecutive bets then you are correct. although the likely hood of that is small. especially considering we are +4 .0 6  units in our 6  play career! haha,172
mschwimer,"actions speak louder than words. my money is on the table. and you just folded like a cheap suit. facts are facts.

but you can always insult me if it makes you feel better!",173
mschwimer,also you should buy the 4  week package. no ncaa basketball.  $ 9 0 0  to buy.  $ 2 0 0 0  back (including fee) if we cant beat the market. still good odds!,156
mschwimer,either way. the new language 1 0 0  %  covers the guarantee. no one can argue that. i do understand you think it isnt perfect. but you cant say it doesnt cover the guarantee.,174
mschwimer,rufus is certainly not a part of this. we both have a mutual hatred for tout services. we did implement a lot of his ideas. mainly being transparent and financially accountable for our recs.,190
mschwimer,thats not my fault. i can tell you our plays are all public so you can see. also independently verified by an independent 3 rd party. top 1 0  nationally recognized accounting firm cohnreznik,191
mschwimer,to your point. if we get more than 2  thousand  subscribers (highly unlikely) we will not accept anymore as we wont be able to fund it if we lose. or we can raise more!,168
mschwimer,i cant see the each play that is time stamped. can you show me where to find that?  also do they give money back plus if their picks lose? i cant find that either.,163
mschwimer,1 0 0  %  correct. so we have an 8 6  %  chance to win a bet and only have to give 2 .3 -1  odds. its a no brainer. what am i missing?,134
mschwimer,yes. but then we get lumped into the people i hate. touts. dont want to go 4 -8  in a week then say this pick is 1 0  units and claim a winning week.,149
mschwimer,i will also say that we could absolutely fall flat on our face. if we do i will look like an idiot and whoever subscribes and doesnt play our recs will look like geniuses.,171
mschwimer,disappointed for responding? it is very clear you have not done the research. watch the real vision interview. or read the bloomberg article. lots more media coming in the next couple days/weeks. stay tuned!,207
mschwimer,its one thing for me to say we are the better than anything out there but that is what all the bs touts say. im putting my money where my mouth is. will you?,157
mschwimer,absolutely not. i am being completely clear and up front about how we will handle all scoring. living up to our goal of being fully transparent to our subscribers and not hiding behind anything.,194
mschwimer,for those not watching snell has 1 0  punchies in 4  innings. 2 0  is definitely in play if we were in the old school era and didnt care as much about pitch counts.,164
mschwimer,you and me both. porcello was lights out. big swing and a miss in that game. if the rangers hold then  will be 3 -2  on the day! will always take 6 0  % ,153
mschwimer,6  in a row is incredible but statistically very unlikely. if we had a 6 0  %  edge on every play picking 6  winners in a row is still less than 5  %  likely.,158
mschwimer,i better not hear one hater say that was a bad call. 1 0 0  %  correct call. indisputable. for those who say let the players decide. they did. the player committed the foul.,173
mschwimer,can we get rid of the dimmer and replace 6 0 w bulbs for 1 2 0 w bulbs so we don't give up any more doubles to the pitcher at coca cola park?,141
mschwimer,very confused by this.  in my link i describe the importance of line shopping in great detail.  however our picks still beat the market if you didn't line shop.  again these are just facts.,189
mschwimer,while that tweet is pretty funny it is not true.  the worst thing for us as a company is if people register for free then unregister as that shows we do not retain.,164
mschwimer,then the lines could move right after we release which would again be a disadvantage to subscribers as they would have less time to get the picks in at the lines we release.,173
mschwimer,of course not. you can bet none of the games. or pick and choose. you can do whatever you want. refund is based on how our recommendations do. not how you do personally.,169
mschwimer,im not a browns fan. and dont browns fans always think they are going to lose? this is the first year i think they were very optimistic. could be wrong on this though.,167
mschwimer,conference call in 1 0  minutes.  open to everyone.  please dm me any questions you have and i will not hang up until i answer every single (respectfully asked) question.  always full transparency!,197
mschwimer,absolutely. which is why this business model is completely unsustainable. it will work for a short amount of time. we will not offer a subscription service if we cant consistently beat closing lines.,199
mschwimer,i am the only tout in the world that provides full transparency and financial accountability if the picks dont win. the only tout in the world that has financial alignment with the subscriber.,192
mschwimer,its legit the reason we created this system. so you could bet against us. im confused. they system you are asking for is right in front of your face. unless im missing something.,178
mschwimer,i hate the tout indusrty. no way you hate it more than i do. spent years figuring out a way to bring it to its knees. finally have the stuff to do it!,150
mschwimer,5 0  out of 2 8 0 0 . and again we dont post those for paid subs. feel free to remove them from our record if you want! still up many units!,140
mschwimer,we take 1 h and g a lot. but thats the extent. we rec  $ 3 0 0  per play. so  $ 3 0 0  on each side. what is wrong with that?,125
mschwimer,i should say the limit is our bankroll. we need to make sure we can pay it all back if we lose. but i highly doubt we will ever get to our limit.,145
mschwimer,"i think we are done making changes to the ts and cs now! if you guys cant poke any holes in it then no one can!

sincerely appreciate all your help with this.",158
mschwimer,just got off the phone with him. language will be fixed within the hour. it was meant to be additional. but language was unclear. it will be fixed!  thanks again for finding this!,179
mschwimer,our record says otherwise. either clv is not best way to judge or we are lucky to the tune of more than 1  in a million. one of the statements must be true.,156
mschwimer,i am most certainly not a sharp.  i don't create the models.  our team does.  it is why i named the company after them and why each of them is an equity partner.,161
mschwimer,i can tell you exactly. vs. betcris we were up 1 7 2  units. vs. closing line we were up 1 4 0  units. again all this can be found on our site.,143
mschwimer,of course. talk to anyone that has run a book. they try to get equal. but obviously doesnt always work. but that is their goal! goal is not to find the correct line.,165
mschwimer,all plays are 1  unit. use the betcris line at time we release. we only release between 1 1 amet and 1 0 pmet to accommodate subscribers from both coasts.  any other questions?,176
mschwimer,sign up for free and you will see! our record includes all our recommendations that are time stamped with the book we used so you can see all lines and when we post.,165
mschwimer,all solid comments. rufus do live lines even exist at that time of the game? if so would love to know what pit to win down 3 -0  in the 9 th were.,146
mschwimer,they are in full alignment if a pick service would guarentee the customers their money back plus extra money if the picks lose. then the pick service and customers incentives would be aligned.,192
mschwimer,7  plays today on .  detail 2  of those on our podcast below.  looking forward to getting back on daily wager in a half hour! tune in   live show from 6 -7 !,157
mschwimer,making my  debut tonight!  if you enjoy sports analytics and content that you will not hear anywhere else tune into daily wager.  show airs at 6 pmet.  second half hour all ncaa hoops!,184
mschwimer,great article by  this has been a huge issue for a long time. i have been preaching a combination of a few ideas jayson wrote about that i think solves all the issues!,167
mschwimer,next: former pitcher  runs big league advance a company investing in baseball players offering lump sums for a percentage of future earnings. he joins   stephen brunt on  to discuss the business. listen here,207
mschwimer,oh i beg to differ. only one way to find out! let the listeners decide after we have a professional debate on the issues at hand. i am in. dont know about,154
mschwimer,see. not as easy as you think. we are 2  things. fully transparent and financially accountable for our picks if they lose. how would you market that without sounding like a clown?,179
mschwimer,its been 4 8  straight hours for me in twitter. i will not stop until we have a system that cant be picked a part from a transparency or financial accountability way!,166
mschwimer,"iv been called worse. remember i was a shitty middle reliever that played in the city of philadelphia. 

but i will only speak the truth. people can call me what they want.",172
mschwimer,i agree completely. this will be added. we will also give everyone the opportunity to get a refund and notify all subscribers of the change in ts and cs in email form.,167
mschwimer,you got me! i have no idea is the answer to this question. is it not standard to have? i can talk to our lawyer. he was the ex gc for mgm,137
mschwimer,i can tell you. martin has 0  stake in anything related to jambos. just a pro bettor that subscribes to the service. i did not know him at all prior to jambos.,159
mschwimer,that is simply false. please read the detailed summary. you will see that being +1  unit guarantees profitability! if you use the system correctly and bet  $ 3 0 0  per game.,174
mschwimer,many pros subscribe. this is a 1 0 0  %  fact. i have no idea if they are betting our stuff or not as i have no access to their betting accounts.,145
mschwimer,"those are all great reasons to sign up! if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if wrong you only lose 3  thousand !  

not being defensive. just stating facts.",161
mschwimer,never said that. you can do all the research you want on our line movement. all our plays are free for everyone to see. they are time stamped so anyone can verify.,163
mschwimer,i have 2 3  plays today! its the most plays we have ever had on a single mlb day. you can see all the picks for free at . free for everyone!,140
mschwimer,the emails are automated. i never received an email with that request. what email did you send it to? you could have simply asked nicely on twitter. no need to be mean.,168
mschwimer,thank you! as i have said from the beginning of the season. i believe our baseball model will beat the market but not by much. our football model will be our best!,163
mschwimer,need to subscribe in order to see everything. subscribing is obviously free for everyone. but making the faq available for non subscribers is something i will consider. thank you for the suggestion.,198
mschwimer,picks are free for everyone at .  podcast picks are an unsustainable 3 0 -8  right now. overall ncaa record is 8 3 3 -5 9 0  (+1 7 5 .7  units).,144
mschwimer,a lot of people have been asking about bracket advice. this 4 0 min podcast not only explains game theory and strategy but also unveils our jambos bracket for espn tournament challenge!,185
mschwimer,"nba predictions.

mschwimer,i am a huge nba fan... i have now seen every nba team play at least 5  times.  i thought the 6 ers were a fluke now im 5 0 -5 0,127
mschwimer,i am having the a hard time finding a place to stay in clearwater from feb 1 3  till the end of march. if anyone has any ideas i am all ears.,141
mschwimer,i guess it is unfair to give a prize to a number follower. so from now on every 5  thousand  i get i will randomly pick a follower to win a prize!,146
mschwimer,"why did you write ""requesting a copy of that report via the means described has not yielded any response"" when you never reached out to us at all requesting any information?",173
mschwimer,yep. that one was a big fat loser. my best bets are well over 6 0  %  for the show though. sorry you caught one of the 4 0  % ers.,130
mschwimer,below you will see an explanation of how our system works the problem that occurred and how we will fix it moving forward.  thank you  for bringing this to our attention.,170
mschwimer,thank you for bringing this to my attention.  i will answer this on twitter as i take this very seriously.  i am investigating the issue now.  will have an answer shortly.,171
mschwimer,"we answer that question on our website faq.  the question is labeled ""should i still bet on a game where my book has a different line than what you send out?""",158
mschwimer,i appreciate you listening with an open mind!  please listen at the 2 9 :3 0  mark of the podcast for the exact reason we do not post estimates for bankroll.,157
mschwimer,i appreciate you listening with an open mind!  please listen at the 2 9 :3 0  mark of the podcast for the exact reason we do not post estimates for bankroll.,157
mschwimer,i will get gp board to sign a pdf that guarantees repayment if picks lose. same as terms on our site.  is that what you want? would you consider that sufficient?,161
mschwimer,they have seen it in other areas i have pursued. big league advance. they know the modeling that goes into that. and they know me personally. word travels fast up there.,169
mschwimer,changes to ts and cs are coming. but that wont change because its way better for the sub. ask any lawyer. arbitration much cheaper than a court case for the sub.,161
mschwimer,no it doesnt at all haha. show me where the ts and cs say that?  also i said i would do this bet on  terms. so your point is useless anyways.,141
mschwimer,it most certainly isnt me! i wish i was that smart. what you will always get from me is full transparacy and the 1 0 0  %  truth. that is it.,141
mschwimer,all of our subscribers can track.  has already said they will buy at least 1  package. do you not trust them to track? cant imagine anyone wanting us to fail more.,163
mschwimer,ill take that as a thank you for listening to my concerns and making the changes i requested. i have nothing else to say so i will needlessly make up bs,152
mschwimer,they are most certainly better. the less respect we have from the market the better it is for our subs!  agian  we put our money where our mouth is. will you?,158
mschwimer,scroll to the bottom. below the video. menu only works for people who register. you should register anyways. its 1 0 0  %  free and you can see our history etc.,160
mschwimer,this i completely agree with. but we win flat betting and last thing i want to do is come off as a tout that puts our big unit plays when down.,143
mschwimer,it is not a side bet. he is signing up for 1 0 0  subscriptions. we go by the rules of each subscription. please do more research on how this works.,148
mschwimer,officially. we are +1 7 2 .7 2  units vs. cris at time we release. +1 4 0 .0 7  units vs. cris closing line. in 2 7 6 8  recommendations.,137
mschwimer,id like to go on record to say our model hates that play. but good luck anyways! i have no skin in the game either way so ill root for you.,139
mschwimer,less than 9 0  minutes away from another launch today. i will be appearing on the daily wager on  from 6 -7 pm et!  its live and its real. tune in!,147
mschwimer,have no fear! i believe touts will have less than 5 0  %  their normal subscriber base within 2  years. it is my mission to destroy them all!!! cville for life!,160
mschwimer,majority of wv bets also played by nj rules. in fact of all the states only nevada plays by the old school rules. maybe nevada is the exception in the us?,154
mschwimer,we dont have a nba model yet. not sure if any model would work due to the durant unknown. but if i had to take a side id take the warriors.,139

mschwimer,it was a true honor to meet and do the  podcast with tony kornheiser.  i have been a huge fan going back to the washington post days.  surreal day for me.,154
mschwimer,"watching 2  uva hoops games a few things are clear. 
1 . we are going to be fun to watch
2 . love huff
3 .  is legit behind the mic",131
mschwimer,i have used this glove since 2 0 0 8 .  it is the lightest glove on the market and it is custom fit for your specific hand. (2 /3 ),131
mschwimer,dont be scared. iv been to 5  gmen games including 2 0 0 7  nfc championship in green bay. giants r 5 -0  when i am there and i will be,135
mschwimer,if the eagles use mccoy more in the passing game they will win... in 4  out of the 6  games he has caught less than 4  passes... this is a joke,143
mschwimer,i need a hairct. need 3  things. 1 ) female. 2 ) needs to be able to handel a curly jew fro. 3 ) gives a great scalp massage while shampooing.,142
mschwimer,u know u r with the right girl when u come home from an 1 1  day road trip and she has a choco taco waiting for u in the freezer,128
mschwimer,exactly!  this is why we show them absolutely everything.  we do not pick and choose what we show.  that way the person can make a decision with the most information possible.,175
mschwimer,attn: every state - the state of new jersey collected  $ 1 0 9  million in taxes from internet gambling and sports betting in 2 0 1 9 . do both,143
mschwimer,thank you! yes i can confirm it was the only player i took to win the heisman. futures bets are often not great mathematically but underlying work in  paid off!,160
mschwimer,we have not had a single subscriber complain that they were not able to get that play in.  trust me we would have heard about it if they couldn't haha.,151
mschwimer,ha! i was such a bad pitcher.  zippy chance i made it to a starter or a closer.  i threw 9 0 mph and it was straight as an arrow.,129
mschwimer,i said it was unlikely to happen in the short term. but it certainly could. and we wouldnt want to take proactive steps to help that happen by betting ourselves.,161
mschwimer,you are correct in that we could say that. however if you listen to the podcast starting at the 2 9 :3 0  mark you will hear why we dont.,137
mschwimer,a blog post will have people with questions. then another blog post. then more questions etc. etc. etc. a simple 3 0 min podcast will cover everything. all about efficiency.,173
mschwimer,because it was free for everyone and all our registered users got to see all picks in real time and for free!  they are 1 0 0  %  publicly verifiable.,150
mschwimer,if you can find a book that will take  $ 1 0 0  thousand  of action on every bet i want to make i would 1 0 0  % .,114
mschwimer,i didnt know a single person on espn. they found me because they followed jambos when we were free for everyone and they followed our picks. that is a fact.,156
mschwimer,yes. 4  weeks for  $ 9 0 0 . if we lose you get  $ 2 0 0 0  back (including fee). its getting to be our most popular package.,125
mschwimer,"1 . we do get clv. just not a lot. 
2 . yes but in fair markets only. sports betting market not fair market because people cant bet unlimited amounts.",150
mschwimer,if people like you dont sign up its impossible for me to blow up. only way i get exposed is if a ton of people sign up and i lose.,130
mschwimer,most importantly. have i answered everyones questions? are their any other outstanding issues on the ts and cs?  please let me know if i missed anything. always want to improve!,177
mschwimer,so are you saying that every single pick from 2 /1 2  on is not detailed on the site? if thats what you are saying you are flat out wrong.,138
mschwimer,not advertising any record. we post all our plays so everyone can make their own decision. you can take away those plays if you want. others like to include them.,162
mschwimer,id argue that getting money from subscribers and not giving them their money back if the picks lose is shady as hell and the tell tale sign of a scam.,150
mschwimer,we dont make bets. and i can promise you. it is not the player in my talking. the modelers have found things i really wish i knew as a player.,142
mschwimer,i would love to hear from any bookmaker that their goal is not to get equal action on both sides. if they do exist they are certainly not the majority.,151
mschwimer,whoever made that chart should love us and subscribe immediately. according to that chart there is no way we can win so that person will get 1 0  thousand !,156
mschwimer,haha no!  jambos is an acronym for 6  of our analysts. they do all the hard work in modeling so least i could do was name the company after them.,145
mschwimer,i said they had 6  of 8  projected better for this year. and i believe my projections were correct. can argue for 5  but i think i was spot on,142
mschwimer,im not smart enough to breakdown the complexities of isas as it relates to baseball in a single tweet. if i tried i would be leaving incredibly important information out.,170
mschwimer,you have personally witnessed  pick at 6 0  %  over 1 5 0  games. and we give out all the picks for free to everyone. up 2 3 .1  units!!!,137
mschwimer,all picks are now free for everyone at ! 1 5  second registration process then click recommendations to see what we are on.  lots of nit action up right now!,157
mschwimer,really excited to be going on the tony kornheiser show this morning! excited to talk bla as well as give my thoughts on the world series and game 2  predictions!,161
mschwimer,epsom salt cold tubs are incredible for recovery. if u r ever sore from a hard workout fill the bathtub up w ice cold h2 o and add epsom salt,141
mschwimer,i went to the eagles game last night. i know it was a loss. but being able to build around foles and a great running game is a huge positive,140
mschwimer,victor cruz had 5 9 5  yds after the catch this season. the nine  wr's who caught passes this year had a total of 5 3 7  yds after catch.,137
mschwimer,question for eagles fans.. who are you rooting for in the superbowl? do u want the title to go to the nfc east? or r u rooting for the pats?,140
mschwimer,also i will have a jar w me... put ur twitter handle on a buisness card and i will randomly draw one at the end to win a free prize!,132
mschwimer,made a deal with d. brown. if i get 1 0  thousand  followers by sep 1 st then he will join twitter.  the ball is in your court phillies phans!,142
mschwimer,because i feel strongly that picking and choosing is misleading.  i feel strongly that people should be judged on the entirety of their publicly verifiable record. not picking and choosing.,189
mschwimer,the pick process is the exact same.  meaning we time stamp our picks on our website as well as send the instantaneous email so its impossible to manipulate our records.,168
mschwimer,what a fantastic find! represent   although i should probably be taken out of the mix in this group as i had a 1 0 .8  era that year.  oops.,140
mschwimer,i would love to do that! obviously i have zero say in anything espn related but if they want to do it i am 1 0 0  %  in.,120
mschwimer,wont be a trial. we will offer 1 7  week packages with exact same financials throughout the year. so if it is as you say you should sign up!,140
mschwimer,your statement is correct. my question to you is why does that sound ridiculous? is it because its ridiculous that we are actually providing financial value to our subscribers?,176
mschwimer,let me get this straight.  are you saying if we had a professional conversation about this that the smart listeners would agree with my pov and disagree with yours?,164
mschwimer,yes. if every bookmaker could get guaranteed 5 0 /5 0  action on both sides with large amounts on each side they would take it 1 0 0  % ,136
mschwimer,hard to know what our models will predict.  sorry for the vague answer.  we should have 1 0 ish plays a week in the nfl and more in ncaaf,137
mschwimer,we are both  and  in your   example. if we dont pay you dont think the gp will be sued for its assets? by definition they are backing it up.,140
mschwimer,what point? i have addressed all points i believe. if i missed something please let me know. fyi. about to take off on a flight in 1 5  min.,140
mschwimer,you are correct. kelly is 1 0 0  %  best way to bet and manage bankroll. no question. our system doesnt allow that because we dont put edges out,144
mschwimer,not true. he said point blank that he didnt believe our plays will win over the long haul and no one could make the financial guarantee we are making.,150
mschwimer,not true. they are not passive at all. they are the company!! we have limited partners but those names are general partners. they hold the risk same as me.,155
mschwimer,in and of itself it means nothing to me. it 1 0 0  %  matters. but its not the only thing that matters. sorry if that wasnt more clear.,135
mschwimer,it is most certainly verified by an independent 3 rd party. cohnreznik is a top 1 0  nationally recognized accounting firm. their report can be found on our site.,162
mschwimer,its about our model predictions. not clv. again if you think thats right then sign up and dont take any of our plays and get 2 .3 -1  odds!,139
mschwimer,all our plays are posted for everyone to see. they are time stamped and were available for free to the public. we had hundreds of subs. check for yourself!,155
mschwimer,if you actually believe that then put your money where your mouth is. if your right you get 1 0  thousand . if not you only lose 3  thousand ,141
mschwimer,exactly! we are saying we believe one thing. you are saying you believe something else. im giving you 2 .3 -1  odds. why on earth wouldnt you take that?,152
mschwimer,if you believe that then why wouldnt you buy our package? if you are right you get 1 0  thousand  if you are wrong you only lose 3  thousand ,141
mschwimer,it is most certainly not! our general counsel is ex gc of mgm. we have our bases covered. we are not taking any bets. simply giving out pick recs.,146
mschwimer,then you should subscribe!  if you are right you get 1 0  thousand . if not you only lose 3  thousand . put your money where your mouth is!,139
mschwimer,5 8  %  vs. when we put in the plays. when we put them in our subscribers get an automatic email so they know the second we release picks.,138
mschwimer,anyone with a brain would think its ridiculous. glad the nj books have common sense and do things the right way. vegas needs to adapt. its simple common sense.,159
mschwimer,agreed completely. its an absolute joke. also the fact that the books cant agree on what to do is worse. at least  does things the logical and correct way.,155
mschwimer,i watched that game. that was an awful beat. and that was just the first half. several easy looks of jokic passes in the 2 nd half as well.,139
mschwimer,you are most welcome. i would caution sample size though. but it is great to be hot. bottom line is we are here for the people.  free for everyone,146
mschwimer,"did tony play the lottery  looks @ gm 1  of the  (it all starts w/ a foul ball)

mschwimer,i had a side bet with a teammate that stutes would have 1 0 0 0  followers by the days end... if u love the phillies u will follow,130
mschwimer,the bad news is i couldnt feel my hand when i was pitching it was so cold... the good news is my fastball was moving all over the place,135
mschwimer,our picks became publicly available on 2 /1 3 /1 9 . we are coming up on one full year. will release a long year in review thread tweet.,136
mschwimer,i am assuming subs purchased pics from when we started selling. not arbitrarily picking what weeks to purchase. full record. not picking and choosing like terrible touts do.,173
mschwimer,i have the answer for that! would love to discuss and let the people know if you want. as always you are welcome to come on the  podcast.,137
mschwimer,jumping on  show on  at 1 0 :3 0 pm et.  going to break down my best nfl play of the day and a few props i like.,112
mschwimer,yes. subscribers that signed up for week 2  alone are definitely losing now. even after debate. i made that clear in previous tweets. although the week isnt over!,162
mschwimer,"no tout on earth would ever give subs their money back plus additional money for losing recs. 

also definition of tout is one who sells picks. 

its tough.",156
mschwimer,any tout that makes people pay for losing picks i have a problem with. period. i believe people recommending picks should be in financial alignment with subscribers. period.,173
mschwimer,i know it sounds crazy. but that is basically the exact deal i offered  they declined. smart on their part. its obvious they did their research on us.,150
mschwimer,but then all our other ventures would have to go to 0  as well. and we have hundreds of millions in assets. it is possible. but highly unlikely.,144
mschwimer,i respond to everything!  completely separate from sec filing. we raised money at a  $ 1 3 0 m valuation in november of 2 0 1 8 .,129
mschwimer,yes. because i hate the tout industry that much!  and there is not a single book in the world that will let me bet big limits at it.,132
mschwimer,just like cal ripken. wont leave until every autograph is signed/question answered. i preach full transparacy and accountability. plus im learning a lot!  particularly has been extremely helpful.,195
mschwimer,oh. gotcha. do you want to see their official report? email the contact page on our site and they will send it right over. signed by their partner.,147
mschwimer,really enjoyed the interview.  will get a kick out of the 5 min mark when i call our  for not at all believing anything they say about us.,138
mschwimer,they are most certainly involved. dont know how other companies work but they are very involved in jambos and the ones taking the financial risk if it fails.,157
mschwimer,no. i have always said clv matters. its a mathematical fact. its just not the end all be all. can still be very successful without getting great clv.,149
mschwimer,not an issue for  we have agreed to put money in an escrow on their terms. we are paying up front!  and they still cant pull the trigger!,137
mschwimer,out 2 7 6 8  recommendations beg to differ. all of which can be found on  for anyone to review. can even review them vs. closing lines etc.,139
mschwimer,ok. so i want to be very clear. you dont trust that bill miller marvin bush david ganek and steve duncker are good for it. is that correct?,139
mschwimer,i agree! its on our list of things to do. albeit at the bottom right now. but should get to it in a year or so. great idea,122
mschwimer,i remember red sox fans giving me heat because i said our model had voit projected to be better than moreland. they said we should burn the model.,146
mschwimer,absolutely.  plus anyone can review our picks at anytime. we post all the necessary information so the twitter world can call us out if we make any mistakes!,157
mschwimer,big home run for will smith.  for you  fans out there keep your eye out on him.  really solid player.  probably not star but very solid everyday player.,152
mschwimer,hate to break it to you but they did want me on tomorrow. i had to bang it because of  bi-annual in person board meeting. sorry to disappoint.,142
mschwimer,impossible for me to lose. if its under the marlins ml hits. but i do want the clean sweep of first 5  over game over and marlins ml,132
mschwimer,this  match has been insane.  its been 2  hours and we r on serve in the second set 3 -2 ... som won the first set 7 -6,119
mschwimer,iv been getting a lot of questions from young pitchers that want to work out but can't leave home. u can get a great total body workout cont,140
mschwimer,one of the very few things i like shopping for are watches.  i think i finally found a watch that i will be wearing for my wedding day.,135
mschwimer,dont know why people are saying good job to me... we lost when i was on the mound.. no matter how u slice it that is completely unacceptable,140
mschwimer,not the best last couple of days but still a 5 -2  road trip.  let's get after this huge home series and have some fun at the bank!,131

mschwimer,in addition we do not give out all of our plays.  dw we have given out 6 0 2 .   has given out 4 4 1 7 .,104
mschwimer,and how did i respond when you asked to see the report? do you care to tell the full story? or only the part that is misleading?,128
mschwimer,we post every week. good or bad. just so happens all 3  weeks have been good. but we continue to post everything. the good and the bad.,135
mschwimer,thursday night props went 7 -1 !  now we need our game of the week to hit on sunday.  listen to hear our analysis of the game.,126
mschwimer,in addition we could never cover all we need to cover on twitter. im sure it will be at least a half hour of back and forth.,124
mschwimer,only one comment. i would love to come on bet the process to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you said is entirely incorrect.,135
mschwimer,"the logic is direct. 

i say something 
you say bs
i say ill give you +2 3 0  odds
you get scared. 

or am i missing something?",127
mschwimer,not true. up +1 7 5  units vs. bookmaker. go to cumulative record. scroll to bottom. click the see record vs. bookmaker and close to see everything.,148

mschwimer,we want only  $ 3 0 0  bettors. that is what our system is based on. if you bet more our system might not be for you.,117
mschwimer,thank you! we will fix all of this! really appreciate the help. will 1 0 0  %  be done by end of day. probably within the hour.,127
mschwimer,as always. if you dont believe what i say is true and you think we are not winning bettors then put your money where your mouth is!,131
mschwimer,all our plays are time stamped using betcris. you can check line archives to confirm it was available. you get an email instantly when we post picks.,149
mschwimer,you would be one of the only people to actually back their beliefs financially. the more like you the better for jambos. less line movement on release!,151
mschwimer,based on your comments i assume you will be signing up. am i correct? or are you another twitter troll that doesnt back up anything they say?,141
mschwimer,correct. we cant beat those numbers. but on games we select we can! thats the beauty of being a bettor. you dont need to beat every line.,137
mschwimer,i explained where ed is wrong. again if a book would guarantee us  $ 1 m per bet then we would 1 0 0  %  do that.,113
mschwimer,yes. had yankees first 5  and game. all our plays are free to everyone and can be found at . biggest play of the night is dbacks,128
mschwimer,from what i am told. pinny is the gold standard for sportsbooks. do you disagree? rufus what book do you think is the best in the world?,136

mschwimer,another rain out... double header tomorrow... got an hour for q and a if anyone wants to know about minor league philly life or life in gen,139
mschwimer,got it.  so you think option 4 .  you should use your bet and the closing line for market consensus not one book.  is that correct?,131
mschwimer,and again. this would have 0  effect on our record as all our picks are graded at the bookmaker line at time we release the pick.,129
mschwimer,"""because thats the way we have always done it."" aka the legit worst excuse imaginable.  legit no logical reason for them to do it that way.",139
mschwimer,"using the kelly criterion is a big thing for sizing bets. gamblers and sports betters don't size their bets properly.

- michael schwimer (fm.0 8 )",147
mschwimer,haha. its a great platform. marc cuban stan druckenmiller and other bigtime people in finance are on it. i highly recommend if you enjoy finance content.,153
mschwimer,i am more than happy to set up a conference call to discuss if you are interested.  i think it will be enlightening.  but maybe not.,132
mschwimer,you simply cant say that. how would you explain us willing to put millions of dollars in an account that  chooses to back our stuff up?,135
mschwimer,our plays destroy the close. go to our records page and check for yourself. we post all our plays and how they do vs. closing lines.,132
mschwimer,then how do you explain  declining our offer despite us saying we will put  $ 1 m up front in a back account of thier choosing?,127
mschwimer,i like to think im a good father to my 4  year old daughter and 1  year old son. also a good husband to my wife,111

mschwimer,exactly! if you dont believe it then put your money where your mouth is! take all our money. we are giving you 2 .3 -1  odds,124
mschwimer,that is the contract! our guarantee is part of it. by clicking a package and paying for it. if we lose we are breaching the deal.,129
mschwimer,on . all picks are time stamped so you can verify its same line as betcris. you get an email the instant we post a pick,119
mschwimer,it was. but will certainly take a 5 -2  day +3 .1  units. good to have a bounce back day after the awful week we had.,117
mschwimer,i never ever said clv isnt an indicator. it is mathematically an indicator. its a mathematical fact. im saying its not the end all be all.,138
mschwimer,breaks my heart to read that. please do some research on what we do for minor league players. read the sports illustrated article at a minimum.,143
mschwimer,for all the money  makes. you see this type of oppertunity and only willing to put 3  thousand  on it? that seems odd. why not more?,132
mschwimer,we are backed by bill miller (legg mason) david ganek steve duncker marvin bush and hundreds more like them. its about integrity transparency and financial accountability.,171
mschwimer,no opinion on your question. good news is i have a french open play as my best bet. tune in. show starts in 1 0 min!,116
mschwimer,getting hot is always fun. sorry to disappoint but i wont be daily wager tomorrow. will be on tuesday though so make sure to tune in!,133

mschwimer,and if u actually read any of my blogs ud know that the majority of it is not about me but about the game of baseball,117
mschwimer,if i do i do. if i dont i dont... i really dont think about it... all i can control is each individual pitch i make,115
mschwimer,i am not frustrated at all... i love the phillies and i think they are a first class organization. but that doesnt mean they like me,132
mschwimer,question - if you were a casual bettor that was looking to bet games that had the best chance to win.  where would you send them?,129
mschwimer,seriously try it yourself.  go to  and spend 1 5  seconds to register and you will see the entire process.  we will never ask for money.,136
mschwimer,you are 1 0 0  %  correct here. i apologize. i was driving and didnt look at exact records. it was sloppy on my part.,117
mschwimer,if i am as big a fool as is claimed then rufus should be able to destroy me in front on all his listeners right?,112

mschwimer,our history of over 2 7 0 0  plays that are free and available to everyone doesnt count? even though our record significant better? ok,134
mschwimer,of course we have an edge. but its understandable that people dont believe we do. which is why we give them an option to short.,127
mschwimer,we believe. and our track record indicates a 6  %  edge. and that is over 2 5 0 0  plays that have been publicly available.,123
mschwimer,this is exactly what we are looking at. except our average edge is way more than 4  % . 4  %  is just the minimum.,114
mschwimer,steve duncker was the chairman of nyra and personally did several deals with betfair. but its clear you didnt do your research on those names.,142
mschwimer,we have been very hot lately but our clv has not. this is not a good sign for future plays so please proceed with caution!,122

mschwimer,absolutely.  we are currently doing very well financially but that can always change! nothing is guaranteed in this life.  many big companies fail every day.,157
mschwimer,jambos is a very large company.  we make money a lot of different ways.  you can look up our relationship to metric gaming for example.,135

mschwimer,who said anyone was betting it? i certainly dont bet. i have no idea what the people that register do or do not do.,115
mschwimer,thank you! our team is split. most r but some python. we found the most predictive modeling comes from machine learning techniques/random forest modeling.,154

mschwimer,thank you! now i dont have to write it myself. you looking for a job? could save me a lot of time and effort.,109

mschwimer,if thats what you really believe then get the money while its hot!  take the 1 0  thousand !  any reason why you wouldnt?,121
mschwimer,the most ridiculous thing is that  is suppose to be the gold standard yet they are not transparent or financially accountable for their recommendations.,152
mschwimer,you really think those guys would risk their reputations over a few million dollars? you really have no idea how the business world works.,138
mschwimer,and yes. they are all available to anyone that registers. registering is free for everyone. so all prior plays are available to the public.,139
mschwimer,what? of course you can see all prior picks. scroll to the bottom of records by sport and click to see all individual plays.,124

mschwimer,yo yo... how is the austin house hunting looking? should i try to get  to work on it or do we trust neal?,105
mschwimer,"""  but i'm a teacher... i don't have business cards.... :("" doesnt need to be a buisness card. any piece of paper works",119

mschwimer,do the current pigs have more players drafted by the phillies or have at one point been a member of the pirates organization?,125
mschwimer,im a little busy these days. plus hard to build a predictive algorithm for that. i wish you the best of luck though!,116
mschwimer,so then lets do it publicly so everyone can hear and judge for themselves.  that will be the first question i answer!,117
mschwimer,literally every single subscriber except the solo week 2  subs would be winning right now after our payback. those are the facts.,129
mschwimer,that is 1 0 0  %  not my argument at all. again you think you know. but you really dont at all.,95
mschwimer,if you were giving me +2 3 0  odds i would put as much money as possible that you wouldnt make it.,98
mschwimer,i have literally not heard a single reason from you. if so many are out there can you just name 1  please?,106
mschwimer,we charge  $ 2 5 0  per week for 5 0 + picks. no clue how much vd charges. do you know?,87
mschwimer,we only accept a limited number of subscribers based on how much we are willing to lose. insolvency is not possible here.,121
mschwimer,mainly bulk send. because we use market line in theory you should get better lines as much as you get worse lines,113
mschwimer,do you want a signed pdf from our board guaranteeing we will make good on the packages we promise? would that work?,115
mschwimer,or people are all talk and no action. if they actually believed it they would be lining up to take my money!,108
mschwimer,so only thing left is tightening up ts and cs. that should be done very shortly. will get back when that finishes!,114
mschwimer,and as everyone on this chain has pointed out. i have a longggg way to go. but that is why im here!,99
mschwimer,i can. but then im yelled at for being a shitty tout! its better for people to see it for themselves imo,104

mschwimer,but yes rufus has been a subscriber to jambos from the beginning of our public record.  so last 6  months or so.,112
mschwimer,yes! i am happy to respond but more than 2 4 0  characters. stay tuned.  coming in 3 0  min or so.,98
mschwimer,correct! all our packages come with refund. the more picks the bigger the refund because the less likely we are to lose.,120
mschwimer,they are investors in the company. check our sec filings and you will see we raised  $ 2 3 m for jambos.,104
mschwimer,we use the market consensus line. so are you saying when we post a line the world wide market will instantly move?,114
mschwimer,thank you! have no fear. we are coming for european soccer in a big way. will be ready in under a year.,103
