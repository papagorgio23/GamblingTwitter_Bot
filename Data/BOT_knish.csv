JoeyKnish22,should clarify. the current cba runs through next season (2 0 2 1 -2 0 2 2 ) however an early ratification could mean changes for this (2 0 2 0 -2 0 2 1 ) season. a strike wouldnt happen until next year but an early deal could mean changes for this year.

JoeyKnish22,yeah its not the worse decision ive ever seen. but the combo of only 4 th and 5  in the redzone the wind bowl game yolo. a fg there sets you up best case to tie with 2  more scores. i personally would have went for it but ive seen much much worse game mgt decisions than that.,276
JoeyKnish22,it was a 3  point game so -3 /-3 .5  was essentially the same bet (getting packers money line) the extra .5  in this case would only have come into effect in the unlikely event of a tie. proper live ml price was -1 3 0 /-1 3 5  so sharp books went -3  (-1 3 0 ish).,265

JoeyKnish22,case in point lets say you had joe burrow 2 0 0 /1  () and now at that book hes 3 /1 . youd have the option instead of laying a no price or starting to build portfolio with other players to cash it for a size-able profit and use the added bankroll funds in the near term.,271

JoeyKnish22,picked up a carry out this weekend girl at the counter asked me what i thought about the area 5 1  march. tried desperately to avoid the convo but she proceeded to go on at length about how shes part of the fb group is super hyped and wants to make it happen.,259
JoeyKnish22,"max is like that one girl in your phone who you typically cant deal with on the reg but she does one thing very well and you drunk text her late night about once every 6  months. 

except in this case its heisman breakdowns. and its that time of year to shamelessly dial.",271
JoeyKnish22,in the end i think he returns cause the pats dont have a ready made plan b and kraft loves him like a son. but agree with nick here if he leaves i sprinkled some titans +1 4 2 8  (best situation) and raiders +9 0 7  (most  $  $ ) this morning.,243
JoeyKnish22,if you arent a  sub and you like to bet college football this question is for you. would you subscribe for two or three months for a total financial commitment of  $ 1 5  if i did an overall team betting preview for all 1 3 0  fbs teams this summer? june-aug window.,266
JoeyKnish22,mel tucker isnt a good football coach. his bears dc tenure was so bad he had no opportunities to remain in the nfl without taking a demotion. rode kirby smarts coattails to a job at cu. was terrible in one season as hc. now takes over a failing msu program. he wont succeed,273
JoeyKnish22,"*me walking around house with 5 dimes merch on*

girlfriend: where did you get that stupid ugly fucking shirt you have on

me: its a goat 5 d shirt my friend tony bought it for me

gf: who the hell is tony

me: he died last year you didnt know him 

*chefs kiss*",262
JoeyKnish22,uncle knish may have been in the mood to talk a lil junk after lsu rolled lol. regardless of anyones tan opinion colin is legit for cfb digs harder than anybody and i respect his opinion. we just happened to disagree on said game but many ppl and the market agreed with him,273
JoeyKnish22,had a convo with  few weeks ago and we landed on a theory that high stakes end boss sports betting eventually drives you to the brink of insanity. in some fashion because 9 9 .9 9 9  %  of other ppl you deal with on earth dont understand it but think they do.,259
JoeyKnish22,dont know any of the true data off my head. but feels like having one week off is a plus. as teams are familiar playing off a bye week yearly. but resting your starters week 1 7  then having a bye for a full 3  week break between live action feels too long.,257
JoeyKnish22,doesnt mean you cant price shop or arb or bet them for fun. but anybody who has a tip or has a buddys cousins girlfriend who heard the results etc. its all bull shit. theres like 2  people that calculate the votes who would be instantly fired if word got out. nobody knows,272
JoeyKnish22,i do think clemson +5 .5 /6  is a bit rich. but i am much less bullish on that number than many of my peers. would be a small play for me if i had nothing on the game. but its not the banger some ppl appear to think it is imo.,226
JoeyKnish22,"if you grabbed lsu futures early szn.  i took clemson +1 9 5  this morning. 

had  $ 1 0 0 / $ 3 3 0 0 .

took  $ 1 0 0 0 / $ 1 9 5 0 .

gonna sit back and enjoy the game. will likely have some props.",200
JoeyKnish22,youre looking at it too narrowly/selfishly. reduced juiced doesnt sell. books arent gonna reduce profitability just to do it. a  $ 2 5  free bet would get more ppl in the door than -1 0 5  lines. until that changes on a massive scale theres no incentive for it to become standard,279
JoeyKnish22,"couple house cleaning items:
1 ) if youre not paid by the first game youre out and we delete your entry. period. 
2 ) if you miss/forget a pick thats on you. dont ask. no exceptions. you should pick every game right away then you can go back and change before kickoff.",268
JoeyKnish22,zach. im gonna be honest with ya. i have no idea lol. theres 2 0 0 0  times  scenarios based on which games they win and which games the other wc teams might lose. somebody smarter than me might be able to calculate it. i just bet the 5 0 /1  lol.,247

JoeyKnish22,python to me is a scary looking snake lol so ive had to carve out a different path. a much harder longer painful and less profitable path lol. but if youre young smart and hungry. getting in with the right ppl early understanding the business you can open a lot of doors.,271
JoeyKnish22,dont let some of the comment trolling here dissuade anyone with the skills or interest. this is a fantastic opportunity. this business is connections. youd be learning from some of the best. who gives a fuck on the starting salary in 5  years youll be scaling up 5 -1 0  times .,278
JoeyKnish22,michigan is also a different team at home under harbaugh. idk why. but the game planning aggressiveness splits perf its all much better at home. rivalry game and michigan hfa should be 3 .5 /4 . osu isnt 1 6 -1 7  points better than michigan on a neutral. buy the number.,271
JoeyKnish22,hell be 3 1  has had 4  season ending injuries isnt close to the player he was and is famous enough to be the next romo or big studio personality and make great money doing that. had also alluded to in interviews he doesnt plan to play that much longer. no chance?,264
JoeyKnish22,whoever is running this social account you march right into the risk room and tell lindeman that uncle knish said this first td shit is cute but how about throw us a bone with some player props. the good shit. and if hes out getting a latte from dunkin bother kyle wilson,271
JoeyKnish22,dont think hes a p5  qb tbh or a lower tier p5 . more of a g5  player. pretty small (under 6  ft) and not an incredible athlete (good not great). for instance think eric barriere is a much better player. think hes a little over hyped cause of the last name.,257
JoeyKnish22,theres a quite plausible scenario simmons can average a triple double (if his shooting really is improved) on a team with potential to have the best record in the nba. which makes a reasonably strong case for mvp consideration at 1 1 0 -1 2 5 /1  definitely worth the sprinkle imo.,281
JoeyKnish22,the key here being unlike notre dame and oklahoma futures last year. instead of being -1 4  or higher in a playoff game. if lsu made it in at 1 1 -1  with the victories theyd have (and accompanying power rating) the 3 3 /1  would actually have value/be trade-able for profit.,275
JoeyKnish22,im not sure how fast it all gels they did lose a couple premium players. but i straight up still think theyre a better team with a better manager than real. would need some serious barca regression and all the new guys fit well but just think that price is way high.,266
JoeyKnish22,the issue for me. this isnt a stock tip from a ceo to save some  $  or like phil mickelson or martha stewart having rich friends and making some scratch on a tip. this was bold face lying to the public about a global health crisis while they sold off their shares.,264
JoeyKnish22,as some have said better strategy likely to dollar cost average in over next few months. i was initially assuming a china like peak and quick decline. but 1 ) idk how accurate that data is + aggressive response 2 ) our trajectory and response is much more likely to mirror italy.,279
JoeyKnish22,i agree the cost of college is absurd and having the majority of our youth begin young adulthood debt laden is not sound governance. but would it rub me a bit the wrong way i paid off my loans in full now everyones are forgiven. yes. but w/e ill get over it.,258
JoeyKnish22,what did the kc box look like on defense? would imagine they go uber aggressive single high and load 8 -9  man box both safetys within 1 0  yards. titans were still able to run on it last week vs balty but you shouldnt have consistent success against that in the nfl.,267
JoeyKnish22,"this is a contest with a reasonable amount of informed/sharper people and the possibility to use stale lines/steam chase old numbers. 

1 6 4  entries were non profitable. average units lost -7 .3  units . 

the most profitable entry was 1 0 .7  units . 

the biggest loss -2 7 .1  units ",288
JoeyKnish22,for years growing up as a kid we would play a local neighborhood fantasy league. every year the husband and wife who lived next door to me would win. one day looking out my window i saw them taken away in handcuffs by police. ill never forget the look on their faces.,267
JoeyKnish22,"apologies we didnt post the long td for this game (got super lucky on the cash) but were back. with the  special. 

took long td in illinois/cal o3 9 .5  (-1 0 7 ). he got -1 0 5  cause hes a piece of shit. good to -1 1 5 .",223
JoeyKnish22,thought this was very good.  has a great story that is relatable and very useful for any up and comer - hit weak markets while you build your bankroll. no need to jump in trying to beat nfl. first time listening to the pod but thought the whole crew was good,258
JoeyKnish22,fyi if you dmd matt on the pool. he will get to it. hes not ignoring you. got over 1 0 0  entries so far so a lot to process. also were gonna put a cap on the pool around 2 0 0 . once we shut down entries its closed.,216
JoeyKnish22,"have baylor and hawaii futures from this thread. will share what im doing   hedge strategy with baylor tomorrow. 

hawaii is a hope/ pray not hedging anything pregame at the steep ml will look live if possible. frankly i didnt put enough on 5 0 /1  to lay this boise ml pregame.",278
JoeyKnish22,i thought the 2 nd episode was solid here. especially the part talking about credit relationships etc. built a lot of my connections through trust ppl knowing if they work with me theyre gonna get paid and vice versa. its still a niche industry word of mouth goes a long way.,275
JoeyKnish22,i knew somebody was gonna bring this up lol. i think taylor was better than reed player to player. obviously reed had the longer career accomplished more but for me taylor was the goat (short time frame). reed was strictly a fs. taylor could play either fs/ss at an elite level,277
JoeyKnish22,"i cant believe im going to do this. after flaunting the haskins fade all last week. i said it was a cross off last night. i lied. not betting a lot will likely regret it. 

but.....lions should not be laying 3 .5  with these injuries. i took some skins +3 .5",258
JoeyKnish22,"if youre an inbreed and like nascar like my peasant friend  he thinks larson is gonna win this weekend. and recommends +8 0 0  or better. 

i think he has no shot and no non championship contending driver has ever won the last playoff race. gl if you tail that idiot.",267
JoeyKnish22,seen others discussing this recently. but with the fins winning and now being pick 3  current. the chase young to go  overall window is open. jets and skins in play for number 1  and with them both having recently drafted qbs if they held the pick it would assuredly be young.,276
JoeyKnish22,not trying to be a prick here but for a couple guys that pride themselves on accuracy you mention fields for heisman and allude to him being the front runner (not remotely the case). just if ppl are taking this pod info as actionable it was not the most nuanced discussion.,273
JoeyKnish22,"heisman race is basically down to 4  players. i know what the odds say but i really dont think hurts can win it without a lot going wrong for the other 4 . 

burrow tua fields young. 

looks like osu media is trying to rally around young more so than fields.",258
JoeyKnish22,i see your points here and generally agree. however the prices available the other day presented the quite rare opportunity of getting a top 2  player on a potential 1  seed at over 1 0 0 /1 . factor in the west is ultra deep and competitive + bucks personnel losses,266
JoeyKnish22,i couldnt find a price close to that until yesterday. i would play down to 5 0 /1 . was 1 0 th last year best weapons in the league upgraded oc light pass defense schedule. probably finishes in the 4 -8  range but 6 5 /1  enough for a sprinkle.,244
JoeyKnish22,lol in fairness the study is 1 4  years old. and tbh most of society willingly makes bad choices in the face of hard data that says they shouldnt on a regular basis (smoking drinking unhealthy food etc). the allure of winning and just fun in general i think drives most.,270
JoeyKnish22,"just sprinted out of the house when i heard the ice cream truck jingle coming down the street. bought 3  items. told the guy i had to at least get a couple things since my kids love the stuff so my behavior seemed more socially acceptable. 

i dont have any kids.",263
JoeyKnish22,long overdue philosophy change away from old man offense. kind of sucks it comes a year after they lose half an nfl defense. if nothing else the product should be much more modern/watchable and not make me want to harm myself with running the fb dive on 2 nd and long.,268
JoeyKnish22,all good. not a burner i actually know the guy lol. knew those were in trouble after the womens. it went fine  wise but of course the widely available one we give out on twitter loses. which nobody wants to hear but just the reality of giving stuff out on here.,261
JoeyKnish22,just to be clear so people arent betting into bad numbers. the godfather liked  overs at + money i agreed. those are pretty much gone at most spots.  same as a bet in any other sport once value is gone its gone. dont be laying a ton of juice either way.,253
JoeyKnish22,nice to see the players get more  and insurance and reduced weed penalties (welcome to 2 0 2 0 ). but the league didnt need another game. was already a war of attrition. the expanded playoff field and only 1  seed getting the bye will have quite an impact on futures.,267
JoeyKnish22,fwiw. i know sportsbook disaster porn has been a hot theme last 2 4  hours. in some cases its been a bit irresponsible imo. from some conversations with offshore contacts i trust i believe things will be just fine. i keep a size-able chunk of money offshore and havent wd any.,276
JoeyKnish22,actually brett. need a favor. the people want to hear you on the next episode of tbwc with  feel free to shame me for being poor on the pod but its pretty weak af if you dont do it and youre obviously not that busy. phil is a big fan btw.,238
JoeyKnish22,i might have the worst photo shop skills in the united states. but i didnt want this one to go to waste without people enjoying it. its me pretending to hit  dog with a chair in the kansas fight. and ive laughed way too hard looking at it 6  times today.,254
JoeyKnish22,too much volume is a common misnomer as is hot/cold. you should be betting as many small edges as possible. can make an argument to adjust bet sizes in a down turn if youre using kelly etc but i dont even do that. every real pro i know bets high volume.,253
JoeyKnish22,you literally said the same thing. then thought you had some wild point because you rephrased what i tweeted and claimed to be an all knowing insider. im not saying sportsbook are losing in masse on live im saying theres still edge to be had but it will disappear in time.,272
JoeyKnish22,mybookie trades 3 4  cent live lines and uses lag. bookmaker takes max  $ 2 0 0  on nba totals live. heritage and bovada use lag acceptance and 3 0  cent lines. bol uses lag acceptance. the risk mitigation strategies are already in place but soon the markets wont be beatable.,276

JoeyKnish22,not that im a country living guy but ive never met anybody with a bad boy mower. never. cant recall them ever even being mentioned. went to the website once and i think the prices were absurd. whos the demographic here? is this like the mercedes of rural lawn cutting?,268
JoeyKnish22,phil steele has been killing people for years with his picks.  you guys at espn let this con man con you.  hes a fraud.   the guys on daily wager seem to try at least however they are transparent about losing at least. steele lies constantly and doesnt factor in juice.,269
JoeyKnish22,fwiw this took off a bit overnight. it was texans pk. i would still play -1 .5 /-2  up to -2 .5 . have to say this incase ppl didnt get the vegas dave impression humor. please dont bet your mortgage. would be 2  units  for me at -1 .5,234
JoeyKnish22,this is a 3  way live goal line. i believe (would need to double check) wolves have to lose by one or win outright for you to cash. for example if the game finishes in a draw 1 -1  you lose. where as my 2  way live line would win.,230
JoeyKnish22,weve been motivated by the unlikeliest source ( and have decided to donate 5  %  of total pool handle to charity. well take some extra entries to make up that delta. well also screenshot the donation. if i finish in the money ill also donate a portion of my take.,263
JoeyKnish22,not just saying this cause they let me on the show weekly (for some reason). but theres not a sports gambling show with better guests and better content out there. and its not remotely close tbh. im an avid listener. if you are too  plz rate/sub keep the suits happy.,267
JoeyKnish22,no doubt. personally i bought on the cowboys +5 0 0 0  (sb)/+2 0 0 0  (nfc). i know garretts a moron but theyre more talented better qbhealthier and have a higher ceiling imo. and this is probably the lowest realistic buy spot (or they wont make the playoffs lol),263
JoeyKnish22,"gonna do a thread on all the thanksgiving day and black friday specials offshores are doing. dont even get whale shamed on this app. warren buffet still lives in the same modest home he bought in 1 9 5 8 . 

youre never rich enough to pass up free money.",254
JoeyKnish22,in all seriousness. this is a great strategy move by dave (to move to instagram). on twitter he takes constant trolling and gets exposed by people with a clue. on instagram youve got 1 0 0  times  morons and can use influencers to promote your scheme. its actually quite savvy.,277
JoeyKnish22,last thing ill say. sports gambling is a very stressful endeavor lol. too much stress can wreck havoc on your mental health. whether youre a pro or rec player. ive had to learn how to manage my load what i can handle take breaks etc. just be mindful of it.,256
JoeyKnish22,his mother and i are so proud that hes been able to use the internet to make so many dear friends. no one knows the countless days and nights in his adolescence where he was feeling so isolated and left out. we are proud of you jo jo smile big!,244
JoeyKnish22,osu has been amazing best team in the country. but michigan got healthy on the dl has input some schematic changes to deal with osus offense and has fixed the run game. youre buying low here on michigan as this is about is as high as ive seen this number.,255
JoeyKnish22,"i hate to do it. i hate. to. do. it. 

but ive had too much coffee on a friday mixed with some maize and blue kool-aid. 

theres some michigan +1 3  goys out there available vs ohio state.

JoeyKnish22,is there no libey in this state. is there no freedom. i had a dream to one day place a legal spos bet in my own state. and we will not stop until we are free at last free at last by god let me fucking bet free at last,217
JoeyKnish22,so false start in 4 th  1 1  with punt unit freddie pulls them puts offense out for 4 th  1 6 . baker sacked. nathan zegura just reported  deliberately false started so the offense could return to the field because kitchens didn't want to burn final timeout. clown show.,270
JoeyKnish22,not to sound like a prick here. and you know way more about this than i ever will. but the thought process is once the live models become good enough where you cant beat them liquidity goes way up and theyll become very popular just with the masses in general?,260
JoeyKnish22,fwiw im fine paying for sub content thats useable. i love espn+ and would give the sales person a handjob along with the  $ 4 .9 9  a month cause its such a great price for what you get and i use it a ton. but wasnt getting that here.,234
JoeyKnish22,yes +1 6 0  worth a bet here. under nfl specials at  fins gave him permission to seek a deal his age contract and flexibility to fit schemes should be attractive to teams. with them in full tank mode makes sense to offload. plus money yes a good bet imo.,254
JoeyKnish22,well folks. not that im advocating to lay -9 5 0  for a 7  month hold. but theres times when you get enough sheep  like  suckered into thinking nebraska could have a special year you get numbers like this. which probably should be -1 0 0 0 0 0 .,245

JoeyKnish22,the hospital horror stories + lack of supplies in epicenter areas is bad. real bad. but assuming some of that can be mitigated over 3 0 -6 0  days and the death rate is much lower than current data implies (assuming many untested positives) you cant risk complete economic collapse.,282
JoeyKnish22,"morning slack discussion. at some point the economic impact of complete shutdown harms more people than the virus itself. 

as for when that is? maybe somebody smarter than me can analyze. 

but i would assume in 3 0 -6 0  days we have to restart economy regardless of situation? idk",283
JoeyKnish22,tom brady  jameis winston targeted open receivers at a near identical rate last season (3 8  %  vs 3 9  % ) though winston's low average separation was more of a product of his propensity to throw downfield while brady's receivers struggled to get open even on shorter pass attempts.,283
JoeyKnish22,"im still a bit surprised since they have no ready made backup option but bellichick knowing when to pull the plug on guys and have no loyalty maybe his best trait.

JoeyKnish22,in 2 0 1 7  3  msu players got charged with sexual assault. the kids first contacted blackwell after the incident. who reported it to dantonio but the school didnt take proper measures. instead of taking accountability msu threw blackwell under the bus and made him the fall guy.,279
JoeyKnish22,this hire coincided with the 3  best consecutive years of michigan state football and msu recruiting in over 5 0  years. they were dominating in state recruiting and plucking talented kids from all over the midwest. he built a brand and his connections and bond with kids ran deep.,281
JoeyKnish22,in 2 0 1 3  michigan stare hired curtis blackwell to be recruiting coordinator. it was a masterful hire as blackwell ran a local very popular football camp called smsb (sound mind sound body). all elite midwest kids/schools attended every year. and he was connected to all hs coaches,283

JoeyKnish22,if you go across the big 4  euro leagues they are the only team in that price range that even remotely has a realistic chance to make a run at the league. i really like a couple of the moves theyve made this offseason regardless of greizmann likely leaving.,257
JoeyKnish22,"celebrities companies and media people sending out money to random ppl via cashapp/venmo etc is a very nice gesture for ppl in need.

JoeyKnish22,fwiw im not trying to downplay the virus or be one of those its the flu morons. its serious and our medical systems being overwhelmed is a real threat. but were gonna have hard decisions to make very soon as the short term economic impacts have been devastating already.,270
JoeyKnish22,yeah i was a bit tongue and cheek saying 1 0 0  mil they obviously live a different lifestyle than most americans. but at this point i have to think the amount of actual cases vs confirmed cases is 1 0 0  times  or greater whats been reported atm.,247
JoeyKnish22,hes purposely misinforming a large audience cause he tried to have a contrarian take and now dug the hole too deep so he keeps downplaying it. even fox news has reversed course. only sociopathic grifters with agendas are still on the its not that bad only the flu propaganda,274

JoeyKnish22,yeah i agree should have phrased it lack of profitability. i dont think losing at scale  is a concern per say but im not sure they can massively scale live handle until the algol are better. but i could be wrong and the current risk mitigation might be enough.,260
JoeyKnish22,its gonna take time. looks similar to other app i mentioned. i think you need to see the live takeover first before these things really take off. but i could be wrong. right now p2 p exchanges dont really work for sports betting so theres gotta be a demand.,257

JoeyKnish22,understand a lot of publications are struggling to make it in 2 0 1 9  and journalism a tough business to make profitable but just didnt think the content was worth a sub. i was kind of longing/hoping for a grantland style publication its not that. at all.,256
JoeyKnish22,hi franchise! first time long time. love these! could you break down ecu/odu for me  ecu has this kid ahlers who ive heard is pretty exciting! and getting points! any thoughts on those pirates this week? not sure how theyve done ats recently but considering betting the house!,276
JoeyKnish22,"not that anybody would have any reason to sweat this whatsoever...

but im up 1  game now headed into tonights trio and we matched on 2  of them. mystics-liberty for those that want a sweat swings a game one way or the other. i need over  needs under.",251
JoeyKnish22,missed this when it dropped but was a great read. in my younger days i used to not take the swings all to well lol. the toll capping screen time game watching spreadsheet analyzing etc...can take on your mental health when youre grinding is pretty significant at times.,269
JoeyKnish22,sure. a couple have fucked it up. but new jersey has basically created the playbook all you need to do is copy/paste and look at the data. michigans proposals have been fine its partys arguing over tax rates and education funding which should have been resolved by now.,269
JoeyKnish22,entire list will likely need a couple things to go right so kept it very low risk. he will likely need a injury to get enough minutes (but a zion injury is kind of correlated to him getting more minutes and opening up the roy award in general).,244
JoeyKnish22,wouldnt waste money on morant/rj at low odds with zion strong chalk. list is basically a combination of good stats bad team guys guys who flashed in summer and guys who should be able to contribute immediately. again zion will win this without an injury. so tread lightly.,272
JoeyKnish22,very true. they probably could have sorted out and cleaned up the data a bit more to create better parameters on the bettors (maybe they did i only read article not full study lol) but this study was done a long time ago (2 0 0 5 ).,232
JoeyKnish22,im sure they just took a mass data scrape so a lot of accounts in that mix that were betting small/dormant/ran out of funds. gambling twitter sometimes clouds this perception but the vast majority of any sportsbook accounts are gonna be under 1  thousand  betting small and losing.,281
JoeyKnish22,howard has to be done. he has to be. has to be. who the fuck would bring him in even on a minimum. hes washed injured and a trash teammate. cant even be a vet bench glue guy. id say the lakers but he already burned that bridge.,227
JoeyKnish22,i mean what market or business outside of pharmacy and medical suppliers would you have upmost confidence in atm? every book is limiting wd amounts. theres a run on wds and limited options to bet and the american economy is basically frozen. as i said its a gamble.,265
JoeyKnish22,fwiw. i opted in. but dont take this as financial advice. if i lost my entire account balance (id be salty af) but fine financially. make a risk decision thats right for you. obviously uncertain times but i think the major books should withstand this without an issue.,268
JoeyKnish22,only one so far was an early colts afc and super bowl price about 6  weeks ago. im not super keen on investing a ton right now without assurance the season actually occurs/starts on time etc. youre kind of putting your money in long term limbo a bit.,250
JoeyKnish22,harris cant cover for shit. they gave diggs away cause he didnt like the defense we were playing (because our dc was a washed moron). im not saying glasgow was an all-pro but we shoulda drafted a replacement for wagner. not paid a career backup premium fa dollars.,264
JoeyKnish22,"the nfl has informed their biggest host hotels in vegas that the draft won't take place there april 2 3 -2 5  industry sources tell me.

JoeyKnish22,gambling success aside the product is struggling. the rule changes havent had the fun effect i think the league wanted. they should go full on cfl next season (motion before the snap). assuming there is a next season lol. and maybe a step further to open it up.,261
JoeyKnish22,a team that isnt getting nearly enough national attention (or in the betting market) is kentucky. just added 2 7 /1  and love their tournament outlook. arguably the best backcourt in college basketball in a tournament setting w an experienced coach and one of best bigs in richards,281
JoeyKnish22,im not a baseball guy at all but assuming this trade is finalized i agree with donnie this price is wayyy too high. hes chalk (+5 0 0 ) at westgate. best player on the best team in baseball. 1 6 /1  is sexy and i hit it.,220
JoeyKnish22,dantonio is staying on in some capacity and has plenty of influence i think hell want department to give tressle a shot. also im not arguing the revenue point but theyve underpaid the staff (coordinators etc) comparatively to p5  schools for years. theyre not a t1 5  spender,275
JoeyKnish22,factor in trump hates the wapo (so im sure they wont go easy on grading) and loves to talk (plenty of opportunity to spew bs). i dont see how this falls under 1 0 . i think its closer to 2 0 -2 5  than 5 -7 .,208
JoeyKnish22,thats like me saying the orange gatorade looked red and red should be graded the winner. i understand rooting for a bet but are you delusional?? who watches that 2 h and says mahomes definitely shouldnt be mvp we should give it to the running back lmao. okay.,259

JoeyKnish22,after the game ended last night the last thing on my mind was wow cant wait for more football next week. i enjoy the offseason break. i dont think year round football especially a lesser product is very appealing. but could be wrong. we will see.,246
JoeyKnish22,"the xfl will likely do much better than the aaf. better tv deals more financial backing and have tried/failed before so theyll be much better prepared.

it is all bullshit.",262
JoeyKnish22,awesome to see how you helped build circa into a premier innovative domestic book in such a short time. but great to have you back on this side of the counter . best of luck brother. (you wont need luck since you know uncle k ),227

JoeyKnish22,thank you to everyone who joined the knish invitational. we had just over 2 0 0  paid entries and donated  %  of the rake this morning. and thanks to  who was able to get us a donation match through work it will double our contribution.,236
JoeyKnish22,thinking about starting a new pod called bet the proper process to discuss things like this maybe use a cheesy terrible hip hop intro. trying to find a semi-annoying asian host. will let you know if you wanna come on as a guest some time.,238
JoeyKnish22,thinking about starting a new podcast  called the really deep dive where we just hijack all their content. have pizzola start calling himself shark capper or something. hire a photoshop intern and have better wifi service. probably put them out of business in a week.,267
JoeyKnish22,the cpt is better educated on this topic than i. but my thought is because they dont need to. your average bettor doesnt particularly care about juice. thats why exchanges never takeoff. it might attract more sharper clientele but reduced juice doesnt equal more customers,272
JoeyKnish22,watt has incredible stats the board. best player on a pittsburg d that has carried the team into the playoff race without ben. has the name brand and jj making a push for him. not sure he wins but i like +9 0 0 .,212

JoeyKnish22,for the he doesnt charge on reddit sheep in the comments. this guy has created other accounts on gambling twitter before using different names the same exact scam and charged for picks. those accounts no longer exist. because they eventually lose. and he deletes them.,268
JoeyKnish22,i agree. an lsu win and its over. however an lsu loss + if tua doesnt play or doesnt play particularly well and that definitely opens it up. thought osu players might cannibalize each other but they seem to be trying to rally around/promote young.,247
JoeyKnish22,yeah. with seattle winning it makes the bet much more hedgeable if you got 2 5 /1  or bettor. but im only invested for low risk ( $ 2 0 0 ) so just gonna let ride. will hedge some if they make the final,202

JoeyKnish22,not rich enough for me to invest and staying away from nfc north as i think the division probably the most balanced of any in football not much edge to be had. however if i had to bet on one team/price that would be it.,219
JoeyKnish22,i havent done a great job of hyping this up. mostly because frank sucks at twitter. and providing record updates. but after a big cheetah comeback we got a photo finish in the wnba contest. if you invested in this at knishypph heres the latest.,244
JoeyKnish22,"nfl week 1  has been out for months plenty of games already shaped. not much to like but one total i still like a bit at current:

browns/titans under 4 5 .5  (-1 1 0 ) 
1 h under 2 3  (-1 1 5 )",194
JoeyKnish22,the passing game is real. tempo/spread is real. they should then win easily the following 3  games to be at 5 -0 . and at first glance florida/mississippi state/alabama all look a tad bit worse than expected schedule doesnt appear as daunting as previously thought.,265
JoeyKnish22,also. you can claim up to 1 0  hours (solid explanation tweet by this gentleman lol) of reimbursement ( $ 2 5 /hour without providing any documentation). so it should be  $ 3 2 5  without much effort if people fill out the form properly.,237
JoeyKnish22,ive never been sold enough on his passing to be a true vocal point cdm hopefully continues to improve. pomykal for me is more of a natural bradley replacement. mckennie and adams have very similar skill sets unfortunately not sure how it all fits yet.,251
JoeyKnish22,cbd is a complete scam right? like same thing as the essential oil crap? just a marketing fraud that doesnt do anything? figured id use some caution and be responsible by asking random strangers on the internet before i buy some at the gas station.,248

JoeyKnish22,lol yeah. this place is the pph version of william hill on steroids. they basically cheat. flagged account (with a q) tries to make a bet line has changed. we get a worse price. not impossible to beat but not a fun place to bet.,228
JoeyKnish22,same guy that never dmd uncle k when they were dropping/went up or that this was even a possibility? and i had to find out the ole fashioned way (scrolling twitter). that guy? and now that guy wants some knish dap?? 2  way street buddy.,236
JoeyKnish22,andy uses low vig shops and typically bets early plus is very transparent with his betting. so 1 1  %  roi isnt outlandish. someone tailing everything would be unlikely to achieve 1 1  %  but would still be nicely profitable at -1 1 0 .,236

JoeyKnish22,live betting isnt necessarily a market controlled by sharps (ala pregame). but by algorithms and traders. youre not betting into a baked market. but these will improve. providers will obtain products that cant be beat. those products are being created and marketed as we speak.,277
JoeyKnish22,had a lot if tweets and dms on award shows. ive learned the hard way. most of the biggest official award shows cannot be beat. they all use 3 rd party firms (like pwc) that have contractual obligations to keep results secret to track votes.,240
JoeyKnish22,theyve nuked most of the potential advantage. minimum 3  prop parlay. can only parlay within one game and that payout includes your wager so only +4 8 6  on that 3  teamer. i dont think even with the stale/correlation youd get to a +ev wager,241
JoeyKnish22,well erica if you werent drunk on lsu kool aid right now and had  $ 1 0 0 0  on deadspin going under and for some reason they wont shut the god damn website down so mason is railroading me. you might feel differently.,217

JoeyKnish22,i hear you. probably not as often as i should. question 5 : what did you do that you really enjoyed was kind of hard to read. i dont really enjoy too much else. very hard to separate myself for any period of time.,213
JoeyKnish22,yup thats the x factor. can a bevell offense be productive/efficient enough in the 2 0 1 9  nfl for them to have success. especially without an elite/mobile qb like he had in sea. im dubious but think the defense should be vastly improved.,239
JoeyKnish22,i know but you do have that capacity. just speaking personally youre okay with the capital holds? i used to do more of this type of bet for guaranteed return but as things progressed needed more capital on hand than tied up in futures.,235

JoeyKnish22,i agree the virus is likely to linger for that period but we should have controls in place within 3  months to allow for closed door sporting events to be held. and frankly the public will very much need that source of entertainment.,233
JoeyKnish22,the  (which has a history of trash pay practices anyway) should pay fighters 2  times  for still participating tonight. ratings handle interest will all be much higher than normal solely cause the independent contractors took on the risk and still agreed to fight.,264

JoeyKnish22,this story is probably a bit sensationalist but westgates reputation very much lives off a legacy rep similar to pinnacle. once a great industry leader. now a solid book thats become more conservative with risk being overtaken by better outs for players (circa).,262
JoeyKnish22,would hold off on all nfl futures until this is resolved. if the league season changes by any amount youll likely be tying up capital for nothing as wagers would be subject to void or bookmaker interpretation. especially rsw/team futures/season long player props.,263
JoeyKnish22,its bernie or buttigieg for the nom imo. bloomby no shot with performances like this. biden cooked with voters. warren (isnt bernie) and kloubachar (bland) too far out of it. pete needs biden/bloom/amy out to rally the moderate vote or its all sanders.,252

JoeyKnish22,agreed but hes the only guy with the midfield passing ability whos even remotely close. would need to take on more defensive responsibility. but the hard truth is bradley is gonna be on this team and likely starting for the entire cycle.,237
JoeyKnish22,in a way. its all tied together but i disagree a bit re:markets. but this route requires me to do nothing but check a box and i have more confidence in sports returning shorter term than the dow. so i took it.,209
JoeyKnish22,not to be a debbie. but just from a market analysis/investment standpoint. assuming we trend anywhere close to italy with corona dont think were even close to rock bottom economically. full on lockdown is likely economic standstill. market plummets. hope im wrong.,264
