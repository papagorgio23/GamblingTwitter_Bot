ClevTA,looking at last 10  years of data. home teams on  thursday night football  have a 60 percent  win percent . home favs win 74 percent  and against the spread home favs are 57.4 percent . on sunday gms the last 10  years home teams have an overall win percent  of 57 percent . home favs win 68 percent  and home favs against the spread is only 48 percent . so anecdotally home teams have an adv on  thursday night football  v sun
adamchernoff,"heads: 50 percent  / ev
tails: 50 percent  / ev

50 percent  + 50 percent  = 100 percent  (0 percent  hold as outcomes sum to 100 percent )

15 percent  hold:

heads: 50 percent  * 1.15 = 57.5 percent 
tails: 50 percent  * 1.15 = 57.5 percent 

57.5 percent  + 57.5 percent  = 115 percent 

if thats required then odds in tennessee would be at a minimum (likely worse):

heads: -135
tails: -135"

ClevTA,"for what  it is  worth  i think lsu is 1. but if i were to make an argument for osu here would be my case:
- beat 9 bowl teams (lsu 8) + 2 conf champs (lsu 0)
- lsu beat sked that averages +2.4 scoring mrgn by 24.6 ppg. osu beat opp +2.6 by 36.2
- osu won every gm by dd (18th ranked sagarin sked)"

ClevTA,whats lost on those that want to wait on the 2 is if u miss early u now have way more urgency to score  still have time left for another possession. for ex u kick a  field goal  down 9 w/2:30 left from the 20 but down 8 u take your time  only go for  touchdown . if u miss the 2 late gm over

LeeSharpeNFL,"i didn't do this chart but if i were i would count  touchdown s as first downs and i would not count declined penalties. so i  daily fantasy sports  gb is moved *too* much by this.

also  it is  3rd downs only so the free play would have to be on 3rd and down with =5 yards remaining to award a 1st down."
adamchernoff,colts went from 9.5 o-51 break even equivalent of 9.94. two books showing 6.5 o+10 reopen bee of 6.38. win rate goes from 62.1 percent  to 39.8 percent  vs league avg. looking at moneyline to against the spread equivalents 62.1 percent  is between -3 and -3.5 while 39.8 percent  is right at +3. about a 6.5 point against the spread swing vs avg.
ClevTA,u are so angry man love how invested u are with your tm. its so lovely.  love how u just know for sure whats happening. even if ben plays one more year u would have to draft one when u have the chance at a high pk. rudolph is trash. smart to have a future with him + fat aging ben. fun
ClevTA,im wary of about 90 percent + of all trends bc they are mostly data mining unless there is solid reasoning behind it. a) id want to know this exact situation where the team is also favored in that gm off monday night football . b) also is this negated bc gb is off a short week vs team off a bye?
12Xpert,but if zoom in on the k's that matter then you can see more clearly the impact of having a bit of skill. in this monte carlo run the 50 percent  bettor had a probability of 38.4 percent  of seeing a 10. for the 48 percent  bettor it was 44.1 percent . for the 52 percent  bettor it was 28.1 percent .
ClevTA,so im clear u would rather wait until the very last play of the game to miss a 2 point conversion when u have zero chance to make up for it than miss a 2 early  u know at that point exactly what u need.just to be clear thats what u would prefer. if thats the case then so be it
ClevTA,"im curious how ne d will start doing when they play real qbs. obv some of this is bc of the ne def but here are the aggregate stats of the qbs theyve faced  where the aggregate qb would rank among all qbs:
59 percent  comp (28th) 6 ypa (30th) 20  touchdown  ( touchdown  percent :32nd) 35 int (int percent :27th)"
AndyMSFW,my numbers think highly of them.  also when one team is good against the spread at home and the other is bad against the spread on the road i feel like there can be an adjustment for it in the opener.  if you and i know about it the line setter certainly does.  additionally vcu has the #1 seed locked up.

you  daily fantasy sports  got to ""say it twice"". you got to do it."
RufusPeabody,if you're down 22 late and score a  touchdown  kicking xp is a huge mistake. think about it this way -- if you fail on the first two-point attempt you can still make up for it by converting after the next 2  touchdown s. but if you wait until after the 2nd or 3rd  touchdown  you only get one chance.

adamchernoff,on the cin game i know that arz is not going to be a huge draw in the situation so considering what could come in on cin off of an extreme result i'd need to go high enough to make arz appealing to sharper players. likely a 5.5 or so or -6 off a really extreme monday night football  result.

RufusPeabody,michael i get your point here that a 3-run lead is effectively larger if fewer runs are expected. but the game total was 11. the expectation of runs in the 9th inning is what matters and  that is  still going to be mostly a function of the pregame total. i was on tex too  for what  it is  worth

ClevTA,i dont know u from a hole in the wall but if i gave u unlimited cap space and the most valuable draft capital in nfl history u could win 6 games in the nfl as gm. he added some talent but was a terrible team builder. he wanted to give freddie one more  year which is a joke
ClevTA,wasted a pick on tyrod the  waste two picks on callaway. keep doing that and see where it gets u. the point is he was a shit head at florida and he was off many boards but u still decide to not only draft him u trade a pk. this isnt using a 6 on tyreek. its bad business
ClevTA,why are u even comparing an afc teams record to one from the nfc anyways? jags had a top 3 defense the last two years  added josh allen. on o they added a competent qb. what data do u need? u act like all teams that do well the prior  year automatically are good the next yr. its odd
ClevTA,"every time i think ive seen every crazy hue stat i find a new one :
when hue was fired the browns had a to margin of +11 but went 2-5-1. since 1990 there have been 42 teams that had a to margin of 11+ thru 1st 8 gms. any guesses to what other teams were also under .500?"
aluckyaday,i like simple  i've heard the 4 percent  losers being restricted is more a trader thing than a book policy. watch lists get too big. the easy way to remove people from your list is to restrict them. also when you have a 7 percent  hold bonus target a high staking 4 percent  loser is no good to you!
aluckyaday,the majority of handicappers that  daily fantasy sports  beat closing line value will be long term losers though joe. the few that  daily fantasy sports  beat it and can win long term are either very lucky or very special. not saying it can't be done but long term very few can eventually the market will figure out their edge

DannyParkins,no chance? so youll give me 100:1 they win a playoff game? thats 1 percent . we had dan plesac and jon morosi say theyre a top 5 team on talent. fangraphs has them 71 percent  to make the playoffs. theyre a good team with flaws that can win if theyre hot at right time with a little luck.
logan_matthews9,"looks like 6 for t10 and 11 for t5 is the number for hovland. on both of those for a little

fyi since i obviously feel as though i have an edge at all lines i try to get an overall number i want to get down on him and scale accordingly - normally ~30/20/10/5 with 35 on matchup"
adamchernoff,the high point on kc past a flat -6 lasted for a total of 8 seconds at betcris and 7 seconds at pinnacle (although just shy of flat there). i think now that it has hit a number with meaning (6 worth just over 4 percent ) we have probably seen the end. at least pin/cris bettors say so...
adamchernoff,well i would say that teams  daily fantasy sports  control who they play but do control how they play. vanity metrics show smu is 0-3 against the spread vs three bottom 120 opponents but in each low handle game with an inflated price on smu they got out to leads that exceeded the closing price late in the 2h.
adamchernoff,also not sure of exact hold. but getting very hypothetical here lets say country wide the hold is 20 percent . that puts the lottery at a $100m ggr. an open market taxed at 15-16 percent  means total revenue from all operators needs to be about $10b for the country on a net 6 percent  hold to be equal.

RufusPeabody,overround in case of -143 is 17.7 percent . but i think the way i did it is pretty intuitive as well -- i'm coming at it from a bettor's perspective of course but a book takes bets on each side (1.43 to win 1). they win .43 out of 2.86 in handle which is 15.03 percent .
capjack2000,what you need to ask yourself is what did kambi give up to get all these contracts? did they pay the huge license fees for pa casinos? did they take a smaller percent  of rev? did they promise unreachable hold percent ? pa revenue is half of nj despite 150 percent  larger pop. its a house of cards.
ClevTA,i personally dont care about winning a sb in 2010. thats ages ago. zero sb appearances with a top 5 qb in history is a black eye. in that case why not go after brian billick? he won a sb and had one of the worst qbs in sb history. i just dont see but again thats me
ClevTA,i never follow a line move but ive been scared off of gms bc of fishy line moves in the past and it saved me. so it goes both ways here. bc the jets injury report was really really bad mid week i thought there could have been inside info on guys who may not play. thats real
ClevTA,eh to say something like he likes the skins line of attack im not so sure considering jets run d is best in the nfl. also maybe its bc im an osu grad but i know haskins inside  out  he shouldnt be on an nfl field right now. making skins throw bc of the run d was ideal
ClevTA,was so annoyed by kitchens saying browns wanted to score 2x in final 1:37 of 1st half that i decided to do a search on how often nfl teams have scored 2x when they've had the ball in their hands with 1:37 or less. since 2015 it has happened 15 times out of 717 drives. thats 2 percent
aluckyaday,i'm not saying nish is not sharp. i'm saying just because he is top of a league table does not automatically mean he is. as joseph says the number of sharps is so small that it is difficult to know if it is skill or luck. supermarkets imply that it is skill when they  daily fantasy sports  know.

dinkinc,in vegas they used to do this to card counters. bully ray is the last person who should be doing this as his gimmick was to be a dickhead and incite the fans and dare them to act like you did....the only thing is the women angle as in should women heels be treated better than men
suuma810,"i assume the reasons for the #chiefs edge transactions are:

a) they switch to a 4-3

b) they want to improve their run d

both reasons seem to be old-school thinking in 2019. its funny that the worst run d of 2018 was a flag on a pass play away from the super bowl. it was kc."
ClevTA,if u asked me before bowl season which teams had the best chance to lose or not cover purely based on lack of motivation i think the list would have been- utah miami pitt and bama. the first two looked awful and lost and pitt barely beat a bad mac tm. lets see if bama shows up
ClevTA,"little nugget on bal/ne. achilles heal for ne d has been running qbs historically. lifetime straight up  against the spread records v ne:
- russ 2-1 (2-1 ats)
- watson 0-2 (1-1 ats)
- kap 1-1 (1-1 ats)
- cam 2-0 (2-0 ats)
- allen 0-2 (2-0 ats)
5-6 straight up 8-3 ats. not bad in comparison"
ClevTA,hate when i cant see what everyone else sees irt big line move. det ol isnt good (25th by pff)  stafford comp percent  goes from 78.5 percent  with clean pocket to 47.5 percent  when pressured(3rd largest drop in nfl). and this vs kc ari lac poor dl. now faces top 10 pass rush at lambeau. im confused
ClevTA,i dont agree with using game theory for a quarterly win. u will come to find out that it will be so bunched up after 3 weeks that its impossible to even think about that. as someone who lost the supercontest q1 last year by 0.5 gm u are at the mercy of the contest that early
ClevTA,i mean they can still win 9 games have a nice season and not make the playoffs. brees wore down at the end of last year. who knows if that was precursor of his downfall but its a risk. they lose their c in unger  have zero wrs outside of mt. 2018 draft is far from proven
spanky,to all the dm's asking me for a lock: i'm a high volume bettor. there is no such thing as a lock.  it is meaningless to provide one or 2 picks.  we are betting things all day and prices vary from shop to shop. when i have full control of an account thats when the magic happens
PlusEVAnalytics,ps there is one upside to breakage. say theres such a heavy favorite that the payout should be $2.15. they are not allowed to round down to $2 so they must round up to $2.20.this is called a minus pool. these can be +ev as the track can end up paying out more than it takes in.
aluckyaday,yes but only if 25/1 was the true odds of him being mos. i believe the true odds should have been a lot higher because he played for salford who were not expected to do well. that is why my for 28/1 for the double is too low. he probably should have been more like (guess) 100/1!
joeytunes2,we just got a message from the mac office that there will be a press conference at noon here at rmf. the first game between akron and ohio has been pushed back to 1 p.m. start. we'll give you an update as soon as we get out of the press conference. rumor is they may not play.
LeeSharpeNFL,"that is more likely than either hou or ten advancing to the the afccg. i  daily fantasy sports  necessarily think  it is  likely though. having the 2 vs. the 3 seed is significant and i would expect kc to lose more games than ne down the stretch.

still possible kc beats ne in ne again of course."
LockyLockerson,"good! a lot of the edges are ""fake"" when  it is  lack of an adjustment to injury but the ones that are real are over 50 percent  and i think the ratings according to the market are really smart.  a lot of this is like ""ok the rating says __ but what else is going on here?"""
DannyParkins,yea i disagree a threat of what? that happens all the time in sports that mitch gets feedback on stuff we say from teams. its his job to shield us from it or admonish us if we stepped over a line that he deems to be our editorial standard. teams reach out to bosses all the time
Gingfacekillah,i do but they won't do you much good. i shared the elo sheet to give people an example of how such a model might work. if you've ever tracked other public elo models for various sports you'll see they  daily fantasy sports  do a great job of modelling sharp markets - for a number of reasons.
Gingfacekillah,"looks like pace in  college basketball  is between 61-81. a few ways to do this:
1. median pace between two teams
2. (team 1 pace - lg. avg) + (team 2 pace - lg. avg) + lg avg
3. estimated team possessions

what i like to do is calculate it a few ways and create a range."
logan_matthews9,"so its on the safe side but it accomplishes a couple things:

- allows me to get a large overall position on a player that is distributed so im not as exposed to one outcome (such as a matchup)

- if the player does have a big week i hit each of those spots and get compensated"
logan_matthews9,for people using offshore books - is don best +ev? am i ever going to find a middle fast enough? i have scripts to scrape a lot of books i use for steam but certainly not instant or as clean (or accurate probably) as i would hope db is. see lots of negative stuff on here too
PikachuBets,pika voice of reason:  daily fantasy sports  rip sammie for losing. if you wanna make fun of him so many other great targets e.g. $500 tout no market knowledge wrong closing line value formula fading steam late etc. but  daily fantasy sports  give him shit for such a short losing streak. bide your time. lol ty ty
Ccon8181,haha classic   .. i cashed out a nationals bet for 18k and he came to the counter and asked if i wanted to bet it. i said no i got killed today down 40k done for the day. he said you still have the night games to get it back then gave me a fist pump. lol
Ccon8181,even off a 3-1 day still pissed about #oregon blowing this. you have the final shot!! not to mention i personally took oregon -3 2 halfand they found a way to turn it over with.7 sec and foul to push that bet. smh not as bad a beat as blowing10pt lead with 1min to ucla but gross

12Xpert,but it requires a really extreme distribution of xwin percent  to make this happen. if i now randomise the order of those 39 percent  and 64.5 percent  bets i get back to 1 again. so you will really need to come up with an explanation for why there can be long periods of way-below-average xwin percent .
12Xpert,fair enough. when you have a 1 in a gazillion record that can be verified then come back to me assuming you want me an others to know  it is  possible. in the meantime i'd suggest you keep the fact that you have such a skill set to yourself so you  daily fantasy sports  lose that advantage.
12Xpert,that is  not something i can help you with. i  daily fantasy sports  profess to be able to beat the sharpest of players and that is whom i would be competing against when betting at pinnacle. i can only tell you that it takes a lot of hard work to be a winner at a sharp book.

capjack2000,"let us  assume a big assumption that he had a 3 percent  edge on every leg of that parlay. nothing indicates he had an edge but for argument sake  let us  say he is a sharp bettor. 

that 3 percent  edge compounds over the parlay. he would have a 29.37 percent  edge on the parlay. 

however..."
capjack2000,"i disagree. a public that loses at a 9 percent  rate is an unsustainable product. like  daily fantasy sports  became. 

left to their own devices the public will lose at a 4-5 percent  rate no matter how much sharp advice anyone gives them.  that is  a sustainable number which makes for more liquid markets for all."
dinkinc,you forget that you are an elite handicapper.i sit with paul and duke for a short period of time every summer and i leave knowing i can never be as talented as that and happily go back to sports.. but i do like to handicap and limit my losses to $196 by playing a live tournament
dinkinc,knowing matt  he is the last person i would try to outthink in this business... do i really want to have a few seconds to try to beat a number put up by the sharpest person i know? i understand why bookmakers would need your product and as long as they can get it i pass
robpizzola,large handle #mnf game tonight. this is about as good a time as ever to remind people that if you are waiting to see which way the line moves so that you can follow/chase that action you are getting the worst of the number and you are very likely going to lose in the long run.
suuma810,cards are a mess. they  daily fantasy sports  have the roster to compete and a defensive-minded hc who wants to run the ball behind a bad ol. we all knew that back in may. steve keim just needs to admit that he was wrong and plug in an offensive-minded head coach to help josh rosen long-term.
ClevTA,the net success rate during that stretch is just as bad. the yds/play is all i had at my finger tips. totally get that russ is a diff animal but sea was down 26-14 w/5m left in the 4th v sf. its pretty fluky time even get to that last second play with chance to win
ClevTA,i know it sounds silly to us but  for what  it is  worth  the stock volume was double yesterday than avg and nobody knows for sure yet if the ad will actually effect sales. id like to think (have been taught my whole life) the mkt is efficient  any dip in price would be corrected immediately
ClevTA,even when hunt comes back they are going to use both together in a lot spots too. theyll flank hunt out since hes such a good receiver. hunt has scored on 10/17 attempts in 2  years inside the 5 which is near the top on rbs. im curious what they decide to do at the gl
spanky,"with respect to my ego ive been on social media since june of last year but ive been betting for the better part of 20 years. you think if my ego was that big i woulda came on here a lot sooner?

i am here to get accounts and call out bookmakers and dressmakers.

keep hatin"
spanky,"heres another knowledge drop that many may not know.

buying onto a number is more important than buying off of a number.

assuming -110 when you buy onto a number you go from a loss to a push saving $11. when you buy off a number you go from push to a win making $10.

$11$10"
spanky,"ive bet on credit with bookmakers for the last 20 years. i just go with my my gut.

there are no ulterior motives. 

i monitor the work. if he wins and starts moving the market i can use that to my advantage. if he loses i pick up 7k.

no brainer ad long as he pays."
spanky,thanks brother. not ashamed at all. my kids were 7531 at the time.  folding the winning hand was tough but it was the right thing to do.  no expungement in ny state so it stays with me for life. cant vote cant carry and no jury duty.  as long as i can bet ill be ok
spanky,this is why 99.99 percent  of people in our industry suck.  but the .01 percent  i know are some of the best people not just in the industry but in the world.  the upper echelon  daily fantasy sports  need lawyers and judges.  we do the right thing under own accord.  pay when you lose.  pretty simple.
spanky,when you bet  10k you have to fill out a tax form. its never an issue until it becomes one.  as much as i would love to bet in as many places as possible  i won't violate any laws to get down. i will continue to chime about how they only accept suckers until things change
aluckyaday,tbh i do it for my own benefit rather than to make money from the subscriptions. it forces me to be disciplined. i have to be up at 8am every morning to make the selections. i want to know by how much beat bfsp keeps me sane during the losing streaks. there have been a few!
aluckyaday,boris just does not get the eu at all does he? their strength is in their solidarity. trying to pit them against each other is not going to work. make an enemy of one and you are the enemy of them all. small weak uk vs large strong eu. there will only ever be one winner.
aluckyaday,i believe a big part of pinnys models are to try to identify the reason behind the money. is it an arber? is it someone with better information? is it a whale? is it someone with a better model (i believe this is rare)? its not weight but type of money that causes them to move.
aluckyaday,i do it by calculating the positive expected value of the bet at the closing price. not straight forward when the # changes. i use pinneys closing price at the suggested # and the price you could get at that # at the time of the pick. getting historical closing prices can be an issue though.
aluckyaday,if sharps could bet with them they would bet soft books as well! the props are easy to pick off and as a collective they often offer less margin than sharps. but their terms and conditions  daily fantasy sports  let sharps bet. it is the most profitable way to run a book and losers are happy.
aluckyaday,probably not the bets person to ask only done the andrew ngs course. not got my teeth in to anything real yet. but the project i have in mind is related to wisdom of the crowd and how the market reacts to it! not certain my idea has legs yet. still collecting data. time will tell
EdMillerPoker,"we've got the three line which is the fair spread with three extra points tacked on.

so in this case  it is  texans -6 covering 36.1 percent .

then we've got the alt spread which is whatever we want it to be but we like to keep it at the pregame line which was saints -6.5."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  love that the value can ""change"" after  it is  happens. this setup means  that cp can be determined in real time and it will have the same value a year later.

also cp tends to improve over time so you'll mess with thst trend if you do it differently for different years."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this thing with the raiders reminds me of a crazy playoff scenario with the colts a few years back where nine week 17 games needed to go their way.

i was in vegas and went to the counter to buy a $5 parlay where eight games went their way but then they lost their own. (1/2)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i know my team is bad. i get it. spend time calling trubisky bad.  that is  fine. he is. and more importantly  it is  something the bears **can in the here and now do something to address**.

but what is the point of going back to the draft or the double doink? those are sunk costs."
whale_capper,for this example lets pretend over under 46.5 closes -130/+115 then youd put 55 percent  on the over and 45 percent  on the under... if you have some added confidence on the advantage side according to the pinny price add like 15 percent  or so because 55 percent  being correct every time leaves you with $6
LockyLockerson,ok so this got away from us a little bit but still has some value i think.  i'll take was-stl u 1.5 at -101 or better. there were +105's like an hour ago but i was giving my kids a bath.  -101 still a 4 percent -ish edge i think?  but again early in the season.
DannyParkins,"- took over eagles team that had 2nd pick won 5 games first year then won 11 11 12 12 and 13 games in consecutive seasons
- took over 2 win chiefs team and won 11 games his first year

logan_matthews9,"took some rory at 9 (mybookie) and day at 51.5 (bookmaker). rory is as low as 6 day as low as 36. put rory at about 15 percent  to win significantly ahead of the next closest (6.5 percent  for rahm). not really close on anyone else

only person im really fading vs market is tiger. yikes"
logan_matthews9,the bet may or may not be ev. ras could post it just to move the market just to give a free play just to show he has that kind of authority etc. i dont know enough about  college basketball  totals either so i cant assume its positive expected value just because the line somewhat-artificially moved
PikachuBets,"oh baby honey . where art thou? come back and prove us wrong! prove to us you are not a fraud ripping off 538s plays. prove to us you are not a twitter venmo tips beggar. prove to u--

...nah you cant prove jack bc you aint shit loooool see you as an alt next week"
PikachuBets,really? you  daily fantasy sports  see the problem? no problem with claiming best of luck opening odds? no problem with needing his closing line value formula corrected (by me via pm)? no problem with mixing in overnights with post-lineup lines close to post? no problem selling for $500? open your eyes and get a clue guy
PikachuBets,"man get the fuck out of here you clown. your article clearly says u7 and the wa line was clearly 7 when you tweeted and when you posted your article. stop being such a fucking loser posting ""under 7 or 7.5.""  daily fantasy sports  tell us you a book with asian totals or some shit lol"
adamchernoff,not sure i agree with that. there was a ton of push in the market at -3 that was not met with resistance until -4. would take an enormous swing of opinion within the market to get this down to -2.5. not any signs of that across the market right now as its leaning to -3.5.
adamchernoff,"included in the episode:

what is a better win total over 4.5 -90 or over 5 -30? 
will kk be closer to 80 percent  or 9 percent  with 10 and 20 personnel?
why the air raid is misunderstood by bettors
what is the mesh pattern?
how safeties can use steal coverage to bait murray
my bet"
adamchernoff,if the change is for rate of play playing from the right tee box should be enforced. ive got much more of an issue waiting behind jim the fellow 20 handicap going driver 3 wood 7 iron wedge into a par 4 than i do him 4 putting and bending over to put the flag in.
Ccon8181,i understand this jeff. but vikes gave a shaky o-line. taking the run almost out of the question. cole is saying worse case is you go to overtime where you still have 50/50 probability of winning. if your up 10 on the 7 going in 5 minutes left. overtime is not the option you factor in.
12Xpert,presumably at 78 (or 80 if they win the undeclared seat) it is. if it isn't then that would destroy the party. no deal is not wanted by the british people. brexit won 2 percent . they didn't even get close to a million votes. if the erg still stand for that they have no mandate.
12Xpert,"so with odds of 2.00 you need about 550 bets to get under 1 percent .
with odds of 5 you'd need about 2150.

-2 percent  expected yield is the assumed bookmaker's margin. it might be worse i.e. -3 percent  or -4 percent  or worse depending on what odds you're betting and what bookmaker you're using."
12Xpert,"depends on odds.
you can guestimate an answer with this:

put -2 percent  in expected yield (cell f3).
put 8 percent  in cell g10.
cell g9 will tell you what the chance is of doing better than 8 percent  if you have nothing.
you want this to be certainly less than 1 percent  ideally 0.1 percent"
12Xpert,"it is  just not good enough to say ""i feel like i made my profits happen."" where luck is so prevalent and it can so easily account for the things you think you see and feel you have to have a way of proving you made it happen. that is what the scientific method is for."
12Xpert,so  it is  mining data until you find patterns that are profitable? if  that is  the case then forgive me if i say this in no way refutes closing line value hypothesis. if you trawl data long enough you will always find patterns that made money. the question is do the make money in the future?

RufusPeabody,because you are paying more in extra vig than its worth. 48 for example is ~3.3 percent  push rate meaning buying onto 48 3.3 percent  of the time you turn a loss into a push. so instead of .5238 (-110) you now have .5238/(1-.033)=.5416 (-118). this case buying on 48 from -110 is worth 8c.
RufusPeabody,ten years ago i met a pro bettor outside a sportsbook and struck up a conversation. two months later he and his partners were betting my baseball. a month after that i quit my job at lvsc and went to work full-time for a syndicate. it was the best decision i made in my life.
RufusPeabody,i have so many ideas  specific things i want to work on/improve but so little time for any of them (twitter ain't helping). there are way more demands on my time now than there were in my 20s. i miss the days when i could spend a month working my ass off on one project.
jeffma,since i got pulled back in. my 2 cents is that this has never been about whether you can win or not. youve proven via your show that you can pick winners. the debate is whether the fade the public strategy is a real winner long term not whether you svp can win using it
SportsCheetah,told the guys this could be a positive thing. but these seem like clear errors (uva 1h ou buy point bet that never exited jets game i said i didnt bet etc) and none of us are going to want to have to babysit every pick from every person every day as you update. gl.
SportsCheetah,i mean really funny but an in-game line fluctuates 2-3 points every possession so for people following the game and want it its pretty easy to get similar or better a lot of the time so still worth posting for people imo. also you missed show today when i said 4q low 3 hours ago
SportsCheetah,the ou o is definitely different this year. more run heavy and not as explosive (granted lamb missed some time). lsu struggled vs. ole miss running qb though a few weeks ago gave up over 600 yards. hurts has seen their d a few times. i think the shock factor isnt at play in the
SportsCheetah,"hou o53.5 -130 - currently the team i project to win the nba finals most often. won 53 in their ""down year"" after starting 11-14 (55 pythag). 65 year prior and russ is an upgrade over cp3 in a lot of ways. trainwreck is in the mix but i like their high-variance approach. 57 proj"
capjack2000,"i  daily fantasy sports  think anyone will ever tell you that. however it was struck in august of this year which meant the initial deal was just a one-year term. so we can probably assume it is either a 1 or 2  year term. 

kambi has a 20 year deal with penn national by comparison."
capjack2000,that is  just it. very few sharps are sharp in every sport. sharp bettors exist on a spectrum. the soft book model paints with a very wide brush. inefficient modeling of your user base imo. dk should have learned from  daily fantasy sports  that you can't gut a fish and expect him to swim back.
capjack2000,"ngcbs response to this is always the same. a wager has 2 components. an offer made by a consumer and an offer accepted by the book. if they want to decline one side and accept the other they are allowed. 

its not fair but ngcb isnt here to be fair its here to enforce regs."
dinkinc,took one once to sleep on a plane. forgot we had a short flight to a layover. why dont you call out all the other tourney players who played today.  i am sure   needs your help too.. you have played more of these than i will ever play. going to canes.  is that good equity?
robpizzola,"in all seriousness with the coming legalization we will have some sort of live lines reporter in-game and no one is better suited for that than preston.

- queue up a 3 minutes ramble on buying on and off lakers -10 and +14"
VegasRefund,can't think of a time where a head coaching job has ever become available with one of the greatest qbs of all time in place..  that is  still in his prime. the more i think about it.. the more surreal it becomes. it has to be the most coveted hc opportunity to ever become available.
ClevTA,i understand the notion but seems far fetched that a team would essentially quit bc they are down 9 with 8m left. imo having the knowledge of needing 2 possessions 8m earlier than u would if u waited to go for 2 is  than any potential deflation. in either case odds are low to win
ClevTA,of course ol was an issue coming into the seaosn. it was their achilles heal. and while its not all the ol fault its been a big problem and having a sold ol allows u to do so much. i hated the callaway trade up  while i dont want all choir boys theres a limit
spanky,great question.  lines are moving all over the place so its so hard to detect with any sense of confidence.  i do remember about a decade ago there was a game where only 1st half spread moved and not the game. it got to the point where both lines were like -6 which looked weird
spanky,"in the per head era we're in anyone can be a bookie.  mostly young broke college kids try and take a shot.  problem is they  daily fantasy sports  have the ability and/or honor to pay off winners.  to all you wanna be bookmakers:

PlusEVAnalytics,my provincetown story...was there with my parents when i was a kid mid 90s. my dad loved all things america. he bought a t shirt with an american flag the flag was rainbow coloured and he thought it looked nice. i told him what it was he didnt believe me. he never wore it again.
PlusEVAnalytics,they did grind out a profit they were the original advantage players. when i said on the podcast that if id been born 10-15  years earlier id be on an island they are the guys who are on that island. they are lucky the judge didnt know enough stats to realize what was going on.
aluckyaday,early days and they have to be careful not to alienate people until their recreational client base is large enough to fully implement their soft book model but my guess is this will be only the tip of the iceberg if what they try and get away with in europe is anything to go by.
EdMillerPoker,"last word on this.

the americans are liking and ing these.

the non-americans are mocking me and telling me i  daily fantasy sports  understand the business.

i'm telling yall if you want to do business here and you want customer loyalty and a good brand ""a bet is a bet"" will go a long way."
GolcondaFund,"""lock of the week"" on a line 4-6 points over inflated because a team looked good having all off season to prepare for the worst team in the history of the nfl. come on now. browns sweep their division and are at 7 wins + tie breakers. and dolphins 8 cardinals 9 den buff 10.."
LeeSharpeNFL,"buf/ne was significant for both could have given buf a shot at the division over ne.

gb/min is in a same spot minutes still *can* take the division with a win  it is  ruled out if they lose.

no/ten matters no is chasing a bye still ten is still fighting pit for the #6 seed."
LeeSharpeNFL,"no flex. dal/phi was almost certainly protected by fox. not a ton of great games but if i were them i probably flex to no/ten as it has playoff implications for both.

but chi is a huge media market they want prime time games in it if the bears are even ok because of ratings."
LeeSharpeNFL,"seems like the logistics of that are challenging (you at least have to stop it until they determine whether to kick it).

 it is  easy to do when the offense is the team that wants to run the clock down but when the offense is trying to hurry up that seems hard to make work."
JoeyKnish22,people. im not saying it took me 45 minutes to do 2 miles. im not 90 years old using a walker jfc. uncle k still got a little speed left maybe not the old 4.3 speed but common. im saying its been 45 minutes since i ran. and now the after death is setting in.
DannyParkins,"yea i have no problem with that conceptually the ""until you get somebody better part"" is where i'd wanna talk. bc if you have a qb you have to be that conservative with you can't pay him big $$ like eli in your example imo so id move on from a guy like that asap."
Gingfacekillah,before nba all-star skills competition i whipped up an idea i had in excel to try and forecast the winner of the 3pt competition. my model projected that joe harris had the highest ev+ so i took him as well as the field vs. steph curry. both hit. the model will be in my book.
Gingfacekillah,yeah i agree. i  daily fantasy sports  find a ton of games with value in an nfl season but usually post a cash positive season. last season was 14-6 for me in nfl. i've been focusing on nba and mlb to try and get as many games as possible. both leagues are very efficiently priced.
logan_matthews9,frankly i should be able to create it - and likely would have at this point if the data was available to me. and i know there are people much smarter than me also held back by a lack of data who could do a lot to revolutionize the sport. instead it is kept secret
logan_matthews9,"i understand i meant for how you view value. 

1) always use your actual ticket for your bet. why would i use market value when hopefully i got better than market value at the time? 

2) as i said i think you are asking for bias when you solely use one book for closing line"
logan_matthews9,for sure. if your br is distributed theres a limit to what you can do. the other difference with a football spread versus like a nba total not every half point is the same so to your point a 6 point advantage varies if its 42 to 36 and 16 to 10. appreciate the feedback
logan_matthews9,"so this was a lot of fun. 2 things kept it from being a very positive weekend and instead ended down about 2u

1- merritt played terrible which sucked because hes the guy we loaded up on
2- moore lashley and im all had a bad sunday

wont bet the open but will bet barbasol"
logan_matthews9,"so i tried my hand at golf modeling - the testing process was promising but well see how it goes. heres what ive bet so far this week:
troy merritt to win: +6600
nate lashley to win: +6600
ryan moore to win: +2800

PikachuBets,i told you i reported you already lol. didnt know twitter actually does anything with it but it just goes to show how big of a cunt you were when i report for spam but you get locked for harassment. you still wanna be raging boners to each other or does this apology still hold?
PikachuBets,"""a business."" lol. you paid $20 for a domain for 3 years and opened who knows how many twitter accounts. you're a random twitter tout; you  daily fantasy sports  run a business. tell your mom w/e you want but  let us  be real here asshat you've never drawn up any aois and you never will"
PikachuBets,hi denny big fan. great research you here. did you also look at what color jerseys bos wore in those games? what about game attendance numbers? could be something there you  daily fantasy sports  wanna miss those angles. i heard that celtics are also like 8-2-3 against the spread when  it is  sunny in milwaukee?
PikachuBets,"lol trust me i'm not even trying to tailing his plays. i'm just super annoyed that a first-year $500 tout is trying to claim best of luck openers and stale lines as part of his ""public record"" which he'll then use to advertise for more tout money. do you not see how that is shady?"
PikachuBets,i would be harsher on sportsinsights but the head guy who runs it actually reaches out to legit sharps for opinions.  it is  unfortunate he sold out to tan but when push came to shove  it is  about trying to provide for a family. a bit diff than tan still meh but not scumbag level
adamchernoff,"mid december is a strange time. nfl is coming to an end and my mind is shifting from nfl to college hoops. but there is always a lingering desire to take a run at betting on horses domestic and abroad. 

maybe there is sense to it or maybe i just need a couple day nap..."
adamchernoff,very much dying to make a trip to texas though. specifically in the central part of the state where it is salt pepper oak wood and no sauce. all about the bark. i have never tried on a full brisket to keep it that simple but it is amazing how they do it down there.
adamchernoff,"easiest team of the ""big 5"" for me to fade at the top of the market. team struggles to generate chances under rueda. lack of creativity has haunted the side the past two years and nearly all key players are out of form. name value will draw money but i will be looking to oppose."
Ccon8181,ben i believe the browns were favored more than that. i have the browns favored in 3 games last year and 1 the year before. ik because they opened as favs verse jets the past two years and i had them each time (however ended a dog verse jets in 2017). still point well made.

mschwimer,closing line value is extremely over rated. i know its what everyone in the industry uses but i firmly disagree. if the sports betting market were a fair market i would agree. but its not even close to a fair market because books dont take big action anymore. we use our model edge  percent .
RufusPeabody,why is everything about proving yourself and hiding records??? me and other people in this thread are bettors. we bet for a living. we  daily fantasy sports  sell picks. we  daily fantasy sports  have to prove anything to anyone. and we can raise points about the company that fired you if we want to.
SportsCheetah,that $5 also gets you access to watching all of the smaller school games in multiple sports on espn+ all of their normal insider content 30 for 30s and other docs/shows etc. chalk makes up 1 percent  of that so if you want to say i charge 3 cents a month for writeups  fair.
SportsCheetah,lac u56.5 -190 - mostly because majority of the market is 52.5-53.5 and  it is  a better relative price. 48 wins last year but 44 pythag. they added a guy named kawhi and another known as pg13. may take some time (and pg out to start year) 53 wins most common result for me.
SportsCheetah,ive hardly even touched baseball since football began so im sure as hell not laying the big faves -140 or higher and i didnt even bet wnba yesterday. youre confusing who youre going after bud. saw a tweet the other night from you weds on a day i wasnt even on the show lol
capjack2000,"(checking date first) 

this is a really bad idea for everyone involved: 
- followers won't get your line for the most part they'll be mad.
- market too small. will zoom to efficiency or cease to exist.

(fyi i  daily fantasy sports  bet lmb)"
dinkinc,so when i saw that bar was your first show i thought to myself that i haven't been there in quite sometime and wondered what would make me go { i live in las vegas }.. thought it would be only if he booked  or  since they are friends and never work vegas 1/2
dinkinc,time to re-up or join up for sept dinkfund..for new followers the donation goes to  the amount is based on a one unit play with a minimum of $200 and a max of $500.. show me a copy of the receipt and i will direct you to a secured twiiter acct for the plays
ClevTA,vikings use 3 wr sets the least amount in the nfl by a wide margin  instead use 1-2 and 2-1 close to 2/3rds of all their plays. unfortunately while the saints are essentially league average on d defending 3 wrs they rank 2nd and 1st on d against 1-2 and 2-1. does minutes adjust?
ClevTA,what are u talking about? if u kick the pat first then go for 2 and the win at the end and miss then what are your options then? tell me how thats better than going for 2 down 8 missing then having yet another chance to go for 2 and go to ot
ClevTA,well that would mean u are keeping an extra wr off the field so less downfield threats but without a good 2nd te and the fact that hunt is a great receiver its not a weakness. not many teams have two rbs who can run and equally run routes so its a nice advantage
ClevTA,i was on pit yesterday for that exact reason. rams ol allowed most pressures in nfl vs steelers who have generated the most on d. horrible matchup. browns aren't nearly as bad and it being at home vs rams on road helps too. draws and screens + our wrs can get open v haden
ClevTA,had zero to do with going for  touchdown  or  field goal  there. the biggest issue was clock management. your goal there is to score while bleeding clock so that russ doesnt get the ball bacm with any time left. throwing in the endzone is fine. snapping with 23 secs on play clock is insanity
spanky,"i call bullshit. 

if my friend and i are in same competition and he beats me there is no way i react like that. i smile hug him and say congrats.

my opinion is she preplanned her losing reaction to disguise her devastating true emotions of losing.

i know - im way too cynical"
spanky,"almost every play can be a holding pi or another penalty.  announcers try to justify each penalty call with replay but then you say to yourself: ""doesn't that happen on every play and there is no flag""   it is  insane how much power refs have.  reason why i  daily fantasy sports  watch fb anymore."
spanky,"photo of  carrying a bag full of money heading into oceans casino ac on the cold windy am of 3/19.

i only met him the night before and took the pic in case he ran off to aruba lol

daves a great writer and a really good dude.

story here  incase you missed it"
spanky,in the per head era where i  daily fantasy sports  see most bookmakers and  daily fantasy sports  have relationships with them i agree with this statement.  however with the bookmakers i do have relationships with i try and work with them the best i can so we can both find a way to earn.
spanky,the error i asked to be fixed was a score keepers error where a free throw wasnt counted. espn website had the right score ncaa website had wrong score... this on the other hand is a refs error.  that being said i 100 percent  agree this should be overturned. i just dont know how...
PlusEVAnalytics,"thanks for following along with my impromptu lunchtime live-tweet.

biggest learnings for me:

- their old picks are vs not only openers but newborns.
- they purport to be getting massive closing line value and losing because closing line value doesnt really matter
- they had some kind of oopsie in  college football ."
PlusEVAnalytics,this was maybe 10 years ago but i finished 2nd in a sit  go at the mirage. paid like $150 and they withheld 30 percent  for federal tax!im not filing a us tax return to get $45 so that money was gone. youre welcome america. one more ivory back scratcher for some defense contractor.
aluckyaday,i've lost count of the number of times my luckies have lucked great value wise at 11am but not so good at the end of the day  high profile tipster moves generally come back quite a bit on bfsp as do the early pace moves. still you have quite a bit to play with
aluckyaday,no it was not! the good friday agreement relies on the single market being in place. leaving in any other way requires that agreement to be ripped up. no uk government is going to do that. so you only have 2 option. uk wide customs union or border in the irish sea. which one?
aluckyaday,but you are not looking at the probability of the single you are looking at the probability of the related double. if he wins the man of steel then the probability of salford being in the top 5 would be quick guess about 1/10. so the odds of the double should be only 28/1!!!
aluckyaday,that is not how soft book restrictions work. you are given a personal reduction factor across all markets whether they have +ev in them or not. if your account reduction factor is 1 percent  you can only bet 1 percent  of the market limit across all markets even -110 on the superbowl coin toss
aluckyaday,but if leaving turns out to be a disaster for the uk... i  daily fantasy sports  think it is actually lack of democracy but peoples belief there is a lack of democracy that is the issue for the eu. i believe in countries where leaving was gaining traction brexit has made them think again!
aluckyaday,we  daily fantasy sports  know what they settled for or the reason behind it. but as you say there was a big risk to them if they went to court. not just the payout but the precedent that may have been set.  although personally i think the court would have ruled in 365s favour.
aluckyaday,if what i am assuming is correct you could beat them by feeding better data to your model at opening but i doubt it would be because you had a better model. i think models are more useful to indicate when pinny may have moved away from the fair price to maximise their profit.
theFirmAISports,for the general public no... were still trying to figure out the best way to provide value to our team and also our followers. 100 percent  dont want to go tout but we dont want to give away everything. we try to post the best plays from our models/experience that we feel will cash
EdMillerPoker,"i'm rambling here a bit but even then going back to your original q you  daily fantasy sports  ""have to know"" anything about how the market maker got to +375. i can just tell you market maker has +375 other book has -375 and you can still make a likely +ev bet from that."
EdMillerPoker,ok so this is not the book where you jam in your 87 player prop bets on sunday morning because it doesn't even offer that. but  it is  where you bet your main pregame bets bc doing that there enables this gamification so while you watch on tv it starts pinging u with interactions
GolcondaFund,"wholesome. 
lol lock -13
not sure i've ever had such confidence in such a glaringly poor line.
had ravens played chargers wk 1 and won by 3 that line would have been ravens -7.
but you do you on the ravens world beater hype train. at this point i'll take 8 other nfl teams"
LeeSharpeNFL,though conversely i didn't think last year there was a clear #1 best team which gave us a good shot. this year does: our ravens. can't see them until the super bowl but it'd be very hard for you to win that (and nfl analytics twitter would annoyingly at you every day about it).
LeeSharpeNFL,"a big unknown to me is how much (especially at the nfl level) is how much is development still to come vs. at this point you are who you are.

i assume between practices and preseason they can find the best guys they have. you can keep 2 on the final 53 man roster."
whale_capper,yeah its not a great angle at all im just not buying that this is a team that is peaking at the right time or hot because they played their way in they eeked out this spot with four close wins vs nfc east teams down the stretch and have serious injuries to overcome
JoeyKnish22,fins looking like the only top 3-5 pick team guaranteed to take a qb team. bengals a bit of a wildcard. some will depend how finley looks how much they fancy the rookie qb class etc. but chase young looks like the best dl prospect since suh. cant see any non-qb go before him.
TheKostos,has anyone ever seen stat corrections with yahoo? i'd prefer not to risk a potential loss given that i've won the matchup and  daily fantasy sports  need to play either guy but also would want to set the world on fire if there was a stat correction and i lost by half a point
TheKostos,"we'll run through every nba game and all the big  college basketball  games from 6-7pm et picks and analysis for all plus a ton more: xfl/nfl/mlb.

if you wanna win you'll watch and honestly who doesn't want to win?

assholes and losers.  that is  who.

 daily fantasy sports  be an asshole and/or a loser."
DannyParkins,ok so now that this is public anyone should reach out to one of the best radio talents in the game. not to mention versatile. he's a great talk show host but he's been a network anchor play-by-play man everything. he's gonna get a good job. let me know if you need contact info.
Gingfacekillah,"so true. to hit a high total everything has to go right. to hit an under only one of a number of factors has to go cold. injury pulling the starters shooting cold no fouls etc.

 percent  of points from 3pas can give a good indication of how right things are likely to go."
logan_matthews9,"ive got two positions for outright:

matsuyama 20.25
munoz 72

matsuyama is fairly far below market (~18) and ive got him at 6.9 percent  (nice)

72 is just a massive number for a guy as decent as munoz. hes a fringe top 10 guy in this field and his drive accuracy has trended up"
logan_matthews9,its been one of the worst coached games ive seen this bowl season. not going for 4th and inches from the 50. then running a qb sneak twice with less than a yard. then going for it on 4th and 12 from the 30. fascinating someone could be so clueless as to basic probabilities
PikachuBets,not a pro but work with many. nfl tough to judge bc it takes like 3 seasons to get a large enough sample size and by then you might not have any edge left. even pros know there is value to winning in the short-term. after all in the long run were all dead
PikachuBets,as someone who has positive expected value and analytics in his twitter name lets just say 1) you are not the target audience for this game and 2) you have nothing in common with the degens who will flock all over this and thus 3) your opinion on market realities is way off target
PikachuBets,the fact that you are showing me some simplistic bball-ref definition to make whatever point you're trying to make basically proves my point. you have no idea what ts percent  shows or how to interpret it. saying ts percent  is misleading bc his  field goal  percent  is better is a fucking joke. go home
PikachuBets,"""tried to help everyone""

translation: ""at first i couldn't get down so i dmed  asked twitter for outs. but once the rest of the gambling world realized just how big of a whale i am everyone came out of the woodwork to book me so now i ain't need none of y'all $200 accts."""
PikachuBets,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand welcome to exhibit a re: the major problem with claiming best of luck openers. it makes you think the market moved from -307 to -360. no. best of luck opener was -307 everyone else opened -340/-345. the market didn't move bc he bet. market is just better than best of luck soft open.
adamchernoff,cant speak to the level of some of the greats like anthony curtis in the video or many other folks in betting today. but during nfl season - especially in 2019 - while i might not be at the desk for more than 8-10 a day thinking about prices and games doesnt ever stop.
adamchernoff,from a handicapping perspective i say the main focus is you future weight  lifestyle. if you stay active and in shape it plays off as unique cool and relatable. if you let yourself go being obese with a mario kart arm is a tough spot. i lean over but a clear angle to under.
adamchernoff,directly above them (about 3 feet behind) is an elevated vip area. if you are using the kiosk you are not only using it where the person next to you can see exactly what you are spending but also the biggest spenders behind you seeing it too. some may say it does not matter...
adamchernoff,not sure if i am in much better of a situation. my book headers light up at the top of the column but it doesn't say which game or price moves screen stays static. going on 24 hours now. a lot of right clicking and line history grabbing for instance 107/108 over just now.
Ccon8181,if you want to be disrespectful do so you wont hurt my feelings. my position is they shouldve kicked the  field goal . as for your concern about my level of quant while running a fund.. my model is pre- game. its not an in game situational predictor. to kick was just my observation

12Xpert,"i think  it is  highly improbable that books  daily fantasy sports  know how to quickly differentiate""sharps"" from ""luckies"". if you and i know the difference and know how to tell the difference i think they will too. just have to look at closing line value and the sorts of bets they make. easy patterns."
12Xpert,yes  it is  possible i agree but i would think far less likely than the explanation that you  daily fantasy sports  have 57 percent . without seeing your exact record this is basically all conjecture. and the trouble is so often people insist on things but never actually show me exactly what has happened
12Xpert,"what's your long term expected win percentage with these? if 53 percent  then i estimate the current bad luck to be a 1 in 6 event
if 54 percent  a 1 in 14 event
if 55 percent  1 in 44
if 56 percent  1 in 183
if 57 percent  1 in 1000
any thoughts?"
12Xpert,and a good place to start is to wonder why humans like to take risks and make predictions about the future? which i hope is what i did in my book. simply closing off debate because we take a moral objection to something is not effective imo. surely the war on drugs confirms this.
12Xpert,i put it out for others. i've long since been restricted by the vast majority of books. i could find ways to make it work but  it is  just not worth my while since i earn my main revenue from affiliation. perhaps one day when that stops i will have to make more effort.
mschwimer,"yes. that is precisely what i am saying. of the picks we take we destroy the closing line. 

to be clear. i am not saying we beat the closing line on every single play. only the plays we recommend. 

to be exact. over 2768 plays we are +140.07 units vs. the betcris closing line"
mschwimer,i cant believe i am saying this but the stuff i look at says this is a great trade for the wiz. getting rid of rivers is addition by subtraction for the way the wiz are built. kelly is a terrible wiz fit and overrated in general. ariza is a perfect fit for wiz.
RufusPeabody,"allowing some political considerations to supersede our  playoff committee model (undefeated p5 team not getting left out). our updated playoff probs:
clemson 70 percent  ohio st 68 percent  alabama 66 percent  oklahoma 64 percent  georgia 48 percent  lsu 37 percent  penn st 16 percent  wisky 12 percent  florida 7 percent  aub 4 percent"
RufusPeabody,personally my answer is no. you  daily fantasy sports  know if the picks were against stale lines if the person provided all their accounts to the auditor etc. an auditor can't audit what they  daily fantasy sports  know exists. whether you're charging or not i personally think you need to use public record
SportsCheetah,yeah matt and i were talking the other night about whether or not denver should just let him roll for awhile and see what they get out of him. at this point need to try something to boost the offense especially. i'll watch 1h back but was excited to see him play high-leverage.
SportsCheetah,here is something: jordan poole is shooting 29 percent  from 2 this season. the worst from a player with at least 500 attempts since the nba introduced the 3-point line in 1979-1980 was brandon jennings at 37 percent . since the merger in 1976-1977 paul silas 36 percent . he's on historic pace!
capjack2000,"that jumped out at me when discussing this with alf. 25 percent  is based on their nj mkt share. they had a significant 1st-mover adv in nj. 

in competitive states they won't have 25 percent  going fwd. plus igaming is a much more distributed mkt share. they will have states like nh though."
capjack2000,"if you term your gambling session as each day you bet you would report your winning days and ignore losing days. then you would be subject to 3.23 percent  tax on all winning days. 

some may term their gambling session as lasting all year but i'm not sure how defensible that would be."
capjack2000,"picking at least 3 of 5 coin-flips correctly is actually 50 percent  probability. 

probably too much math for a saturday night but there are 32 permutations of 5 coin-flips. 16 of them result in one side coming up at least 3 of 5 times. betting against him would be 50 percent  too. +100/+100"
capjack2000,"the remarkable thing is their price is not far off the market line their hold percent  on this market is 15.58 percent  and they can't be overweight on liability on this wager as this is not a public or sharp choice for this market. 

and they still have the price up. 

bad bookmaking."
RASPicks,we've been criticized for being bad at both west coast and east coast plays at different times.  have also been criticized for doing poorly on different days of the week.  also have been told we suck at sides totals 2nd halves  college football   college basketball  nfl and wnba.  all have won long term.
VegasRefund,"1st  touchdown  im rolling with m. jones +700 blount +750 and enunwa +1400.

dont blow your load on these please just because it hit last night doesnt mean it will tonight... and if youre one who was late to the party dont drink all the jungle juice at once.. were open all season."
ProfessorShine,success rate in nfl is shade under 50 percent  and just above 90 percent  pat.  college football  is lower rate of 2pt success (osu nor clemson attempted a 2 point conversion all year).  but in this scenario its still worth it to get up 3pts which is an important lead in 4th quarter.
ClevTA,i dont think anybody is saying a win or loss is the determining factor as to whether he keeps his job or not but getting destroyed  by the worst team in the nfl would speak volumes as to how little the team respects their hc  how they quit. extreme outcome today should matter
ClevTA,nonsense lol. but using a sample size of 3rd downs in 1.5 qs  just assuming a punt inside 5 is perfectly reasonable. got it. they converted 4th downs in the 2nd half on a 23 yd  touchdown  in 4th. keep thinking punting wins gms. ask harbaugh  the ravens how aggressiveness has paid off
ClevTA,arizona has been absolutely destroyed by literally every te theyve faced. they are dead last in yards per att allowed to tes even though theyve faced a below avg schedule of opponent tes. if there was a game for njoku to step up this would be it. put those stone hands away plz
ClevTA,buf has given up 4th most explosive run plays in nfl. chubb is tied for 3rd most explosive runs at 20. what's telling is buf has only faced 1 team ranked in top 12 in explosive runs the giants. saquon produced 4 explosive runs on 18 carries  finished with 107 yards (5.9 ypc)
ClevTA,teddy is extremely accurate makes smart decisions  rarely makes mistakes. hes not a superstar with a big arm but with a great d like he has in no and could in chi hes perfect. trubisky is 26th in adjusted comp percent  not accurate at all  nobody has faith in him. its not close
spanky,"this is not the norm. more often than not theres only one sharp side per number.

as lines move there is definitely opposing action. in these casesthe art lies in moving just enough to pit sharps against each other.  the best bms ive seen make it a point to have the best line"
spanky,every bettor aspires to be pro semi-pro or at the least make some extra cash to take their girlfriend out.  ive never met anyone tell me i suck and im just doing this for fun.  i know im going to lose. the right to dream big is stifled by this glass ceiling. sad
spanky,you know the deal hank.  you guarantee my end.  if you wanted me to call the guy on your behalf i'd be happy to do so.  the reason i require betting partners to guarantee my end is that it leaves room for partners to take a shot at me saying they weren't paid.
spanky,being a felon i can relate to both sides.  many undermine my abilities simply because i'm a felon which is super judgmental and wrong.  that being said i also never shy away from my past.  my denial of guilt fall on deaf ears which i've accepted. one day my truth will be told.
spanky,every bettor dreams of being good enough one day to either go pro or make some extra cash.  most will never get there. however the ones that do will be limited or thrown out by a majority of shops. i grew up believing in america you get rewarded not punished for hard work.
spanky,the wynn wouldnt even allow you to lay 7 and take back 6.5 because of this very reason... what an absolute joke.  if you bet a game and either an injury or weather makes you decide to get off it youre not allowed to?!? thats why the major offshores will always trump vegas
PlusEVAnalytics,supercontest win of 2181.50 got 30 percent  of the gross withheld for tax. i can get it back apparently but its a pain in the ass. at least withhold on the net? a few more cages for immigrant kids and ivory back scratchers for defense contractor ceos on my dime youre welcome america.
aluckyaday,"nobody says you can't win. they are not going to ban you for hitting that 15 team parlay.  it is  just not allowed if using ""skill"". if it is false advertising then there are laws to cover it. books have actually fallen foul of that in the uk although punishment has been slight"
aluckyaday,87 minutes and we are on for the full house ogogo scores for bristol and we are down to 3. 2 minutes in to injury time and doncaster concede a penalty and its only 2. a profit of 238.8 units evaporates to a 4.5 unit loss. oh the joys of high variance betting!
aluckyaday,soft books place limits on individuals as well as markets. individual limits known as reduction factors restrict you to a percentage of the market limit. so if you have a reduction factor of 100 percent  you can bet the market limit. if your factor is 1 percent  you can bet 1/100th of it
aluckyaday,has boris been out maneuvered. get him to agree something parliament won't. the eu then say its this deal or no deal. if parliament  daily fantasy sports  agree to the deal and they  daily fantasy sports  want no deal then revoke is the only remaining option. which is ultimately what the eu want.
aluckyaday,"thanks so if i have public information that is not included am i considered an insider? i read a paper on american bookmaking and it referred to what i thought was a high percentage of ""insiders"". when i queried it they said an insider is anyone with info that is not priced in."
aluckyaday,maybe but maybe the line movement is because the tipster is finding value. you are assuming is the line would not move if the tipster did not put the bet up. you can not prove that but you can prove that the closing lines are on average the most efficient whatever the cause.
aluckyaday,my personal opinion for the very best its irrelevant consistently making money at the closing price is the ultimate goal it means you are better than everyone else . but... for those striving to be the best it is very important. most  daily fantasy sports  make it to where it does not matter
aluckyaday,they do have a code of conduct. it is their terms and conditions. if you bet with them you are agreeing that they can restrict you for being a +ev player. there are 2 markets one with restrictions one without. you chose which market to play in and must accept that markets tcs.
aluckyaday,respond to the email saying you do not accept it is a palp due to the overround and the subsequent cut to 7/1. raise the complaint with ibas before the race is run asking them to look at the over rounds. even if it loses continue with the complaint though to its conclusion.
joeytunes2,"i lied my whole life when people asked what i do.
1.) i didnt feel like explaining how i won at gambling. no one believed me.
2.) bc they think it cant be beat.

always told people. i didnt something else. 

people would look at you like a loser or degenerate. or criminal"
EdMillerPoker,"when you place an in-play bet they delay it for ~8 seconds and only if they still like the bet (for them) at the end of the 8 seconds do you get it.

there are a number of things that could happen in 8 seconds to make them not like the bet anymore."
EdMillerPoker,hi amanda. im very sorry to hear that. obv i dont know any of the details of your case but i do have substantial first-hand experience with the system here in nv and ive seen them behave very poorly and not at all in the interest of the children. wishing you the best.
EdMillerPoker,"okay today's in-play tip.

the sunday morning nfl games are a frenzy and  it is  hard to do a good job on all the games. the folks that make lines have to make choices about who to put in charge of what game. the best talent will typically do the big national games."
EdMillerPoker,"you dont need to live in the right state or even have an account to learn this skill. most us books publish their in-play lines right on the web with no login necessary.

just open a few tabs of different books and then watch us and youll start learning to beat these markets."
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i think you are agreeing with me. my argument is that stuff is all a fatal flaw in any in-game product. soccer is both the most popular game in europe and also a tough solve for this problem which is why i think things ended up this way.
EdMillerPoker,i mean hedging costs you ev. if you anticipate hedging then youd have to have to find some parlay that gives you extra positive expected value just for adding legs. im not like an expert on parlay cards these days but i suspect theyre giving positive expected value back doing it their way.
EdMillerPoker,if sports betting becomes a national fad like poker did the most accessible book of this style will probably sell 50k copies plus. otherwise id expect probably somewhere in the 1k-10k lifetime sales range just  for what  it is  worth . also either way id personally price the book on the higher end
EdMillerPoker,if they can get the error rate down to a few errors per season or so then the feed will be valuable. also they could and should add some more flags/info to the feed as well as with the current product there's considerable ambiguity as to the gamestate during much of the drives
EdMillerPoker,"yes ppl will play into it to ""have something on the game"" but compared to what the industry *could* be with a large  percent  of the sports fan public really engaging with in-play betting props fantasy and whatever other games can be dreamed up.. 107 percent + 2-way markets ain't gonna do it"
GolcondaFund,"fitzmagic did to the nfl the next 20  years what the tuck game did to the nfl the last 20.

fumble = raiders v rams sb
gruden never leaves oakland
eagles win sb over raiders not tb
reid never leaves phi
mahomes never drafted by chiefs
jimmyg replaces brady 2 years ago

#nflfacts"
GolcondaFund,"not sure why faded lj when i was one of the few who rode tebow through all the way to that playoff win against the league's best defense. 

is it me or does lj prove tebow got a raw deal because no team wanted to buy-in like the ravens have in lj?

 #tebowrevenge"
nonrandomalpha,thanks for listening! the ravens just faced 2/3 of the worst teams in the nfl; if anything the picture on them is incomplete. if the cards were a bit more aggressive the game could have been even closer. facing a cards team down their top 2 dbs the ravens still only scored 23.
LeeSharpeNFL,"this year was.... not a good year for us. bittersweet especially after three top 200 finishes in a contest that pays out to the top 100. variance is real but we could have done better.

we'll do what we always do in the offseason: look at our process figure out what to improve."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i have no idea why nagy is running him less. maybe because the conventional run game/offensive line are worse. 

but trubisky's 3rd in qbr was a sham. qbr put excess weight on a qb's runs. he was not the 3rd best qb in the league. pff graded him quite low (and deservingly so)."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  wanna push back too hard i like jahns' work and he himself said that nobody thinks trubisky will be the next brees.

but this comparison creates the impression that the bears should stick with trubisky and i strongly disagree. i'd love it if he were the guy. but no."
LeeSharpeNFL,"which is better:

(a) a higher  percent  of calls feel correct in a vacuum but when compared to each other they are more inconsistent.

(b) a lower  percent  of calls feel correct in a vacuum but when compared to each other they are more consistent.

imo we're in (b) unclear (a) is better."
LeeSharpeNFL,"an underrated aspect of going for it on 4th and short is it changes your playbook.

the chiefs ran that passing play on 3rd and 1 knowing that if it failed they still had 4th down available to them. they probably  daily fantasy sports  run that if they planned to punt on 4th."
whale_capper,"are they going to ""try harder""? based on the way the eagles played vs gb probably... are they going to use ""the good plays""? maybe... will they make fewer mistakes? hopefully... all of this is reaching though and i think  it is  more sound to just rely on better coaching as an angle"
TheKostos,"#ucl:

man city to advance -220

dunno if city wins today at the bernabeu but i believe them to be the better team -- especially with hazard out -- and think they get it done across two legs. if city scores even once today they'll be in wonderful shape for the return leg."
LockyLockerson,couple people rightly asked about virginia tech and alabama both of which i talked about earlier in the week.  alabama i am waiting on tuas status even if i eat a slightly worse number.  virginia tech was a bad number last night when i got home but now at 6 is desirable again
LockyLockerson,"widely-available things i bet for saturday.  this will pin in my profile in place of the nba model but i'll put nba back up at the end of the night for those looking for that (you probably have the link saved).

part 1 (early):
12p purdue -9.5
12p army -9.5
12p k-state +23.5"
LockyLockerson,so again people  daily fantasy sports  just fly up the charts.  becoming an mvp takes a lot of time and effort.  giannis is the most athletic freak of all time basically and it still took him several years to get things right (and he's probably going to get better which is really scary).
LockyLockerson,"had some time before the show so here are 1p perceived edges tonight in the nhl (may seem like i've been absent but only 2 games yesterday both were lined appropriately imo)

dal-was u1.5 (7.1 percent  at -115)
la-cgy u1.5 (6 percent  at +110)

car-fla over bos-vgk under are close 1.5 percent -ish"
LockyLockerson,i honestly want to try to explain this in a way thats not adversarial and so it makes sense.  if your goal is to bet against harbaugh as a dog no matter what you are ignoring what the number is entirely.  so michigan is +40 still a bet? +66? +100? hes a dog.
LockyLockerson,the average margin of victory in a preseason game is about home team by 1.5 and the median is 3.  the total changes by week and this week is about 37.5.  if we assume thats the true side/total for all preseason things stand out immediately.  we will go thru them game by game
DannyParkins,contreras. you wouldnt get enough for rizzo and i still think you need a kings ransom for kb so i hope they dont move him. id bet on the drop off coming fast for a catcher like wc who has already had problems sustaining full seasons and his value diminishes at other positions
DannyParkins,nowhere in my contract does it say im supposed to be a homer or neutral. my job is to have as many listeners as possible. i just tell you how i truly feel and let the chips fall. that was my honest reaction to the stafford news but i obviously hope im wrong.
DannyParkins,great play by williams but this is a perfect example of how ridiculous the risk is in the preseason. this is a 300+ pound man who almost falls into matt ryans leg at an awkward angle. imagine losing a 11 year vet who is a former mvp for... what? he doesnt need preseason.
DannyParkins,cant believe its been 5 years since sung woo madness hit kc. i had a lot of great memories in that city but that story always just sticks out. heres the 30 for 30 short they made on it if you wanna learn the story for the first time or just relive it:
DannyParkins,you shouldn't let me ruin your morning and i saw your tweets earlier your right i misspoke about cease i apologize it happens in live radio. contrary to your belief and other sensitive sox fans though i  daily fantasy sports  hate them at all i hope the rebuild works. have a good day.
Gingfacekillah,who do you like for the nba 3pt competition? i took a shot at a monte carlo simulation. i think joe harris might be a value bet. buddy hield and the curry brothers also looking strong. probably some errors in my sim booker and lillard shouldn't be that much of a long shot.
logan_matthews9,"i like this all the way to like -160

dc was not good last year and while i think they made positive moves this offseason losing arriola isnt insignificant

miami meanwhile had 1.43 xg against lafc on sunday which was better than 16 of the 19 teams la played at home last year"
logan_matthews9,"- make a bunch of big parlay tickets broadcast the ones that hit on social media

- use that to sell parlays to other people which just has to bring in more than you lost on the other parlays that were made

- customers lose twice

this happens like monthly on gambling twitter"
logan_matthews9,i dont have the data but id assume the percentage of teams to come back from 3 down is almost 0 (so dropping to 4-0 wouldnt have much affect on that). but 3-1 would be much more reasonable. also that they got that counter wasnt handed to them the corners werent good enough
PikachuBets,accordingly in honor of this tilt i feel in my jimmies at the moment as i ingest the delicious odor of this fatso sandwiched next to me we will spray the board tmrw in  college basketball  while my in-laws bitch about how hoppin john doesnt go well with prosciutto. fuck you felicia bye
PikachuBets,"he'll block ppl who like the comments i write or others he deems to be trolls. when i confront him over dm about it he accuses me of ""overlooking the the ones i've left up"" as if he deserves credit for not blocking people unnecessarily! just one of the worst cucks around atm"
PikachuBets,then you'd know there are hardly any buy side jobs for fresh grads. avg expectation is 2- year sell side then try jump to buy side. hence key part is to get into ib for a college kid. the entry-level stuff is what i'm talking about. keep moving goalposts to talk about bridgewater
PikachuBets,"my complaints with you: 1) not honest with picks (inb4 ""line was at the wynn!!"") and 2) asserting superiority over legit pros who actually earn their living from this. get a fucking clue. gambling twitter is not all made equal.  daily fantasy sports  do those things and we have no beef. goodbye ""cat"""
PikachuBets,its not unique. best of luck posts $250/$500 openers for every major market before any other book opens. the lines are soft. they have no influence over wa lines. the fact that you dont know this about the markets is very alarming. if you sell plays you need to learn basics like this.
PikachuBets,hello. thanks for all the dms asking if i'm okay. yes i'm alive but not doing so hot again and busy irl on top of that. been some bad regression on international baskets anyway so giving it some time to cool off. will be back with other stuff when i'm ready. thanks fam
PikachuBets,you are angry like 100 percent  of the time. calm down and take a chill pill. i asked a question and was hoping for discussion. no need to keep asserting your age and yell at me about diapers. death also comes with age so be careful what you're bragging about over there ok?
adamchernoff,well said especially with  college basketball  totals where a couple thousand can move a game a couple of points a lot more opportunity for manipulation. as you mentioned for sites reporting this few if any cite book/bets at specific price. if  it is  all lumped into a  percent  it can be very misleading.
adamchernoff,we see potential for pretty one sided - and more influential than not - interest in cin at home. so from a bookmaking perspective i would want to set myself up to have the larger/sharper wagers balance out the rec on bal likely to come off a shock result maybe -4.5 or -5...
adamchernoff,"starting to see a lot of similarities between the use of expected points added and win probability added in nfl and the early early days of xg in soccer. i am curious to see how long it will take to have an impact on the betting market. it is another ""bucket"" this season."
adamchernoff,to a really defensive minded physical style on the international stage. we will see but i can't help but feel it is just a little bit early for this tournament to see the team really break through. love what is to come in the future though if he can make the right moves.
Ccon8181,ive made it clear from the beginning. each bet is the same unit risked. just because i show a 20k ticket or 2k ticket. i have to sometimes spread the action around. i wont ever show all of my tickets on a game. but announced that each game is same risk from beginning
Ccon8181,not to be a downer but just bc theres #nflpreseason on tonight doesnt mean you have to bet it. football through basketball season is a full on grind. enjoy the last few free weeks. take the girl/wife out earn some brownie points for later. or fire away if you need the fix haha
Ccon8181,solid point.. and i agree 100 percent  if that was the only factor (numbers). i use 3 channels of data for each potential opportunity. when wagering in the 2nd half only the straight simulation is an option. so when i say my numbers indicate warriors are the play its 1/3 of my system.
ToddFuhrman,"betting on sports requires roughly a 53 percent  success rate to turn a profit assuming -110 on all games...

hitting 55 percent  to 60 percent  (assuming -110) is a great season...

using twitter/social media as a guide at least 75 percent  of handicappers hit 65 percent  or better...amazing books can stay in business"
12Xpert,tell me what stat has predictive value then? last 6 games? last 38 games? the fact that man city  daily fantasy sports  have kompany anymore? the fact that guardioloa has consistently failed to beat the best teams in europe if he doesn't have messi in his? bookies pay city too much respect now.
12Xpert,think you know what a small sample is? imagine someone had said away wins in english pro football had been doing well in 2014 so you decided to bet them in 2015. this is how you would have done with all 2047 matches played in that year to  closing prices. +2.83 percent .
12Xpert,"but his account of why he did what he did would be his point of view. i imagine in addition to solving the ""tory bastards"" and farage problem he would probably also argue that it was reasonable to put the question to the public after such a long period since the last time..."
12Xpert,no not any more (it used to be 9 percent ). my general point really is that telling people they are bad for gambling which is indirectly what anti-gamblers do when they say gambling is bad is that you  daily fantasy sports  actual solve the problem of excessive gambling. better to understand gambling.
12Xpert,"so i then ask if sports betting is different because  it is  not quite random and allows for prediction models to compete and the possibility of skilled profit how can you be sure that yours is better than others and you say ""look at my profits."" so you have told us nothing (2/2)"
12Xpert,it is  somewhat starting to trouble me that references to old white people deciding the future prime minister of the uk is a classic 'ism that would be called out in any other context. not that i'm saying this was the point of these data but i thought it important to draw attention
12Xpert,if you didn't care about feeding my ego you shouldn't have bothered turning up in my thread about closing prices with data that proves nothing. i explain theory i then back it up with data to test it.  it is  called hypothesis testing. what you are showing me is luck which is free
mschwimer,in addition i will have my dms up during the call.  so if any questions come up as a result of my answers i will be able to answer those as well!  sorry for late notice but wanted to get this out before week 1.  thanks again to all the new registered users!
mschwimer,last twitter message rufus sent was that he would love to debate but tough to fit it in the bet the process pod.  i assume that means he wouldn't mind spending 15-30 minutes on mine as he could debate and not worry about bet the process schedule. i will work around his schedule
mschwimer,"great week 1 in the books! even after paying our $250 1 week fee subs would have been +$2297 (using jambos system)

sign up for week 2 today to get the money back guarantee plus! signing up after 6pm subs not eligible for money back plus! will have to wait until next week."
mschwimer,i dont mind you coming after me for being a bad phillie. by any mathematical standard you would be correct. i wasnt very good. but what we provide for minor league players is the thing i am most proud of in my life. giving a voice to people who have none. please research.
mschwimer,"a few things here. 

1.  on tuesday i did hit everything spot on except my best bet.  ugh

2.  you should be very happy i was not on yesterday as i was ice cold and would have given you all losers. 

3.  i will be on tomorrow and hopefully giving out pure heat!"
mschwimer,we release our picks and instantly send an email to our subscribers. our picks include the line and book we got the line from. we grade off the picks when we send them out. imo you should just pick a system and stick with it. just be consistent or the record is unreliable.
mschwimer,if mlb bans the shift it will be a terrible decision imo. i do agree that the game has problems that need to be fixed. need more balls in play and shorter games. lots of creative solutions available. banning shifts would be like putting a bandaid on that only sticks for 2 minutes
RufusPeabody,"chances of super bowl winner coming out of each division (per  sims):

afc east 16.6 percent 
afc north: 34.0 percent 
afc south 3.5 percent 
afc west 5.0 percent 

nfc east 2.6 percent 
nfc north 4.2 percent 
nfc south 19.1 percent 
nfc west 15.0 percent 

so yes we are high on the ravens."
RufusPeabody,there are mlb teams that win 100 games most years. yet no team is projected to win 100 games before the season begins. when you have an event largely influenced by chance probability dictates you will variation around expectation. but are the 60 percent  guys going to hit 60 percent  next year?
RufusPeabody,...in the former case it'll be very hard for the average customer to get the release price. you'll also probably be approached by syndicates who will offer you more money than you can make selling to work just with them. either way i  daily fantasy sports  see it as a sustainable thing.
SportsCheetah,wisco was a braksa love fade more than anything at a crazy price. market was over under 10 wins on ohio state. market favored michigan remember too. buckeyes worst rushing d ever last year and ppg i believe as well more concerning. day in his first year has been phenomenal it happens.
SportsCheetah,exactly right... he always had the tools he was the #1 recruit in the country out of hs but in practice they'd give him every opportunity to earn the spot and he couldn't make progression reads after the first option before just trying to run with the ball  which is obviously a
SportsCheetah,the hornets rim-or-3 frequency is at 80 percent  so far tonight. 78.5 percent  entering this game. last year this would have ranked second behind only hou (82 percent ). last season cha was only 70.6 percent . subsequently they've generated the fourth-best expected e field goal  percent  in the league this season.
capjack2000,"well to project a theoretical 15 percent  profit a sportsbook could deal a game at -135 on each side. or could offer some really lousy parlay odds. or could make everything parimutuel and take the cut off the top before winnings are paid. 

remains to be seen what they have in mind."
capjack2000,"things i'm against:
- logs floating downstream into a buzzsaw
- pigs being led to slaughter
- aspiring sports bettors being told they can win but in reality they can't. 

i can't open eyes for a log or give logic to a pig but i can enlighten sports betters to choose wisely."
capjack2000,"exactly and  that is  why many operators will step forward to pay that cost. the kids refer to it as fomo.

in the end it'll be the consumer that bears the brunt of high taxation. when pa opens up online wagering it won't look anything like the consumer bonanza that nj is."
capjack2000,"that is  actually a huge myth about the regulated environment. i can move $30k from my bank account into any nj book in 2 mins. paypal says they can move $1mil into regulated books with no notice. i can move it back out within 48 hrs. 

there's no longer friction on post-up."
capjack2000,"it looks like . has restricted me to $300 sides and $100 totals now. this weekend i beat them for $500 on an aaf bet. their response after losing a bet on an inefficient sport is to cut my limits on efficient markets like nba and nfl. 

this is bad bookmaking folks."
dinkinc,to all my friends who think i should not be involved in political discussions on social media...  i think each one of you should be.... the future of our country depends on us to end the power of a racist dictator who constantly lies and deflects. never a better time to care
dinkinc,made it through to day 2 of the venetian seniors but am short stacked... need to do something positive early or i will be home by noon. not going to play senior event at wsop this weekend as i want to be 100 percent  comitted to the  fundraiser this saturday..come join me
robpizzola,definitely can't get down as much live (right now) but we are still very much in the infancy of live betting. as handle continues to grow so will the appetite for larger bets. if i were a sports bettor starting today i would strictly be looking at how to beat live markets.
RASPicks,good point here but it should be noted that some bettors are able to be at the computer when plays are released (thus able to make +ev bets) and there are some services who allow you to pause service when you are not available so you are not charged for missed picks.
RASPicks,we've been consistent on this: our goal is to always provide the best possible plays to clients. we have delivered on that promise for 20+ years. if you truly think we're releasing worse lines there's no chance we'd hit the win rates we have including 59 percent  on our last 500 plays.
RASPicks,in this space there are a far greater number of people who talk a good game than actually have one.  it may not be impossible for the average person to identify the very few long term winners but it is certainly difficult and would take some level of skill expertise and time.
VegasRefund,the rams winning this game will come down to dominating the trenches. a trendy storyline this week has been the pats oline and how brady hasnt been sacked in the last 7 games and has only been touched twice. if the rams dline can disrupt brady the pats will have major problem.
suuma810,i looked at how much rush efficiency is correlated to pass efficiency during a game. spoiler: it isn't at all. here is the correlation between rush dvoa  pass dvoa for #nfl offenses in single games in 2018 (n=386). only 1 percent  of the variance in pass dvoa is explained by rush dvoa.
ClevTA,thats not true at all. u dont understand how dead money works. hubbard has almost $10m alone that theyd eat if they cut him. u also are not factoring in all the extensions that are coming up that u need to account for- myles chubb baker etc. but i appreciate the lesson
ClevTA,lets just step back bc now i am really curious how ppl think. so crowd is a little bit (not much bc its la  those fans are more subdued than avg) loud bc of your theory. this isnt the nfl where noise effects playcalling/communication. whats the actual effect for a bball player
ClevTA,i  daily fantasy sports  like the steelers. i mentioned that i am not on either side my only point was i keep hearing how miami is an auto play and the line is bad. i was just showing how taking a team with such a mismatch on the lines isn't worth it
ClevTA,a shot? there are legitimately only 6-8 guys who even have a chance right now and hes one of them. seattle has overachieved  odds are high that their record will regress. my whole point in preseason when i bet 75-1 was if vikes go 12-4(?)  he has good #a hes top 5
ClevTA,ahkello witherspoon this yr:  11th in nfl in passer rating allowed only 6 completions on 18 targets148 yards 1  touchdown  1 int. last  year in week 10 obj defended by witherspoon had 3 targets  0 receptions. vs every other sf db:  4 receptions 73 yds + 2  touchdown . witherspoon out tonight
ClevTA,for sure but the whole point is it negates the excuse ive heard that bc they were in so many downs at 11+ yards to go bc of penalties that  it made sense that they went 11 so often. they went 11 no matter what situation they were in even manageable down/distances
ClevTA,the thing with howard is he was terrible last year by all efficiency metrics and cant catch anything. he's really just a short yardage guy to me with no upside at all. sanders was the 4th highest sparq rb at the combine and has game breaking ability. he should get the bulk
spanky,"being good at what i do takes place in the real world. being obnoxious is only a twitter thing. 

anyone who knows me personally knows im very chill and easy going and pretty friendly.

spanky,"i play board games that make me think. the top ranked modern 2 player game is called twilight struggle. im proud to have finally won the world championship! 

no cash prize like the 3 mill the kid won for fortnite (i wish). just this plaque.
now my mind is ready for football"
spanky,i get banned on purpose. i put on intense pressure and find the breaking point so i know how much to bend them with the next guy i send in behind me.  you think at this point in my career i look to spend all my days in sportsbooks. smarten up kid.
spanky,"being a revenue sharing affiliate is too conflicting. you put out content to try and help people while at the same time you want them to lose. 

earning based on referral and/or theoretical is a much more noble path to take imo.

glad im in a position where i cant be bought."
spanky,"im not a contest guy. using a proxy is ok for first part of any contest.  howeverif i were a contender deep  i would never use a proxy. furthermore i would personally put picks in seconds before deadline.

seeing the dark side of the business last 20 years made me a pessimist"
spanky,how can you be a professional sports bettor if you are not in the tout business? being a tout is a strong indicator that you need to supplement your income by extracting money directly from fellow bettors.  the day i get that weak is the day i retire and never look back.
spanky,betting partnerships are more sustainable for all parties. my partners hand me accounts i do all the betting and we share in the profits. they do no work. your business requires clients to pay up front and also be available to work. hand accounts and do no work vs pay and work.
spanky,"every sports betting expert knows all the players and their stats etc. i know less than 5 nba and  college basketball  players.

what i know is what every half point is worth and which way the line is gonna move.  thats whats gotten me through the last 20 years betting sports professionally"
spanky,claimed it was a compliance issue because i have a criminal record.. that wasnt an issue the last several weeks. i filled out all tax forms. i held 32 percent  yesterday and they realized long term with the way they run their joint there is no way they can win long term.
spanky,so we started betting on  last week....  we tried to get a dime on the lions about 1 hour before game time on sunday and they gave us $10! this is an nfl side! we tried to bet miami ohio earlier today and they gave us $5!  sports betting in america 2018
DocBettor,based on the live betting rules i saw i was actually expecting the o4.5 that got no-actioned to be graded as a loss. the rules for the book where i bet the o5.5 seem to state it will get canceled too but they still have the game on the board right now

aluckyaday,anyone who lives in portugal knows you can't believe any numbers that come out of the government  in reality i think a lot of the growth has come from getting black market money on to the books. you get an entry in to the lottery every time you ask for a receipt!
aluckyaday,the us is not the only place in the world! by far the most liquid gambling markets are in asia. the us is a drop in the ocean. why would the us entering the party late suddenly change things? the institutions have plenty of time to do this if they wanted to.
aluckyaday,i know what he meant. but there is no guarantee his betting partners will win. because spanky wins it does not mean his partners will. that would only happen if every partner has access to and could get onhis full portfolio of bets. do partners get to see all your bets spanky?
aluckyaday,i think moneyline is misunderstood even by a lot of people practicing it. moneyline finds correlations not causes. ask an moneyline algorithm to find a relationship between the price of cheese and who will win the world series and it will. it does not mean that relationship will apply in the future
aluckyaday,maybe you would be better off starting with the pitfalls of betting. the majority of bettors have no chance of winning no matter what you try and teach them. see the reaction you get when you talk about clv. paying a tout at least gives them someone to blame when they lose
aluckyaday,so they won't be any betting content/live prices in the app? just the equivilent of an affiliate link? if the app contained any gambling content that would have to be declared to the app store and hence blocked to those under gambling age. bet plenty of 18 year olds use the apps!
aluckyaday,that is only correct if you are a losing punter. it works opposite to that if you have an edge. you are compounding the edge in your favour. for +ev punters multiples will give a higher roi than singles that is a mathmatical fact. but the price you pay is larger drawdowns.
aluckyaday,why it seems strange is probably because the straight up mos odds of 25/1 was way under what the true odds of him being mos should have been given he plays for salford  but if we take them as true odds then about 28/1 would be the correct price for the double.
aluckyaday,so what is your solution. keep the whole of the uk in the customs union until a free trade deal is agreed? not sure a free trade deal would actually negate the need for a border anyway. there are still physical checks between some eu countries never mind ones outside the union!
aluckyaday,the  daily fantasy sports  care too much if an offer is hard to beat as they restrict anyone who can beat them! multi prop same game parlays are the flavour of the month at the moment in the uk. making watching the game more exciting the key rather than actually winning money!
aluckyaday,yes. from reading that document its the engagement that has not been up to standard and the gc are trying to address that. you have to interact to get the addict to admit they have a problem. there is a danger fixed limits will just push them in to the unregulated arena.
aluckyaday,weather team news what the manager had for breakfast etc goes in to the sports model. weight of money and who is betting it would be an input to the client model. what other books are doing goes in to the market model. combine the 3 and out pops a trading price
aluckyaday,not really any different from betting on anything else. but i think the plan of the european books will be to change how americans bet. you bet on that because you  daily fantasy sports  have many other options. the european books will make every game like the super bowl. props for everything.
aluckyaday,rather than mbl a better idea would be to get the gc to make books issue figures for the number of punters they restrict in a similar way to self exclusions. that would put pressure on them not to do it so willy nilly. some books are a lot worse than others!
aluckyaday,my take on modeling is that anyone who thinks they are going to come up with a better model than pinnacle is being a little overconfident. they have better resources than you better data than you and they get to test their model against everyone else's a luxury you do not have.
aluckyaday,"but is not the ultimate aim in a lot of those markets to take a position on the right side? ie place a sharp bet? the ""bookmaking"" is used to create the liquidity that allows them to do that? would be interesting to know the ratio of profits from margin vs position"

joeytunes2,i have a confession. this is my bot. it knows the outcomes of every sport event from 2001 to 2053.  it is  crazy to think that i already know that the miami dolphins win the superbowl this year. but  it is  true. it also predicted  the charleston chiefs would win through violence.

EdMillerPoker,that point i  daily fantasy sports  get at least on dk. as i recall it was pretty easy to enter a small handful of lineups into every contest on the site and then if you changed the lineup in one place using their web interface it would change it in every contest.
EdMillerPoker,"feel the need to respond once to you bc you hit the exact same note every single time in these convos.

not every brand has 35 million customers losing money hand over fist to them. some are struggling or want to find a competitive niche. this idea is useful primarily for them."
EdMillerPoker,what i think is so crazy about that strategy is theres literally pricing errors all over the menu ok. i know lots of people from the gambling world that all they want to do is sit there and click buttons all day long but because they arent dumb they see the errors
EdMillerPoker,"well yes we do make our own pregame lines but when we make live lines we take into account all available information to make the best line we can and that includes all the market information available to us

we're very much not just plugging in a pregame line and hitting go"
EdMillerPoker,i started a thread this morning where i suggested trying to be everyone's 2nd book (because you  daily fantasy sports  do everything but you pick something and do it great) and everyone told me what a fool i was and look at me now i just invented an entire archipelago's entertainment economy

EdMillerPoker,im not anti-000 or 6:5. these seem like reasonable offerings esp for the throngs of low stakes once a year casual types. but if the conversion is so complete that real gamblers say i wont play at x because they refuse to offer y and z anymore i think you messed up.
EdMillerPoker,he was a relentlessly positive person.. even his rivals i think would find it hard to dislike him. as far as i could tell he was poor his whole life and despite being for many years one of the top players in the city and state he charged almost nothing for lessons

d) has he ever won a shoot out?

GolcondaFund,"all sports people have say.

nonrandomalpha,when under pressure agreed manning is bottom tier garbage - but when he has time he actually is a top 10-15 qb statistically speaking. he threw for 4300 yards last season and only 11 ints; over the final 5 games led an offense to an average of 28 points/game with few weapons.
LeeSharpeNFL,"both. last year was unsustainably good. defense regresses much more than offense generally. last year we had good injury luck. medium this year.

JoeyKnish22,python to me is a scary looking snake lol so ive had to carve out a different path. a much harder longer painful and less profitable path lol. but if youre young smart and hungry. getting in with the right ppl early understanding the business you can open a lot of doors.
JoeyKnish22,still some -140s around this week and i added more exposure. steelers/bengals are dead if they beat the browns at home this week (i think they do) should move to -500ish. westgate is -300 current and that is much closer to accurate imo. best team in the division by a wide margin
LockyLockerson,"made a list of teams who if they won out (incl conf champ) would make the playoff no matter what because of matchups remaining.  

came up with 12 teams.  could argue notre dame is a 13th but if we are arguing then they arent on the list.  

may discuss on show tonight."
LockyLockerson,i think  it is  only like 0-6 or 0-7 it was the first game he ever coached with the team (vs utah) ohio state multiple times and the two specified above.  i mean which of those games did his team underachieve in?  in which were they poorly coached?  meyer is an all-timer.
LockyLockerson,"ok we are back for week 2.  experiment continues.

week 2 sees scoring in general jump a little and margin of victory become just slightly more compact in favor of the road team.  week 2 historical averages: home team by 1.35 (median 2) combined points 40.01 (up  field goal -ish vs wk1)"
LockyLockerson,"so for those who enjoy my occasional podcast work youll be hearing me a lot more in a couple weeks! 

plan is to co-host this show 2-3 days a week. was very excited to be approached by  and try something different.  i enjoy talking and now ill be doing it a lot."
DannyParkins,yes. antonio brown is a 31 year old wide receiver who has a couple elite seasons at most left. this is a soap opera. andrew luck potentially had a decade of elite quarterback play and over $200 million in earnings that he gave up.  that is  a seismic loss for the league.
DannyParkins,i  daily fantasy sports  take a lot of calls on the score ever. the network enjoys calls. also  it is  a solo show so calls/other voices are more necessary whereas on the score i have mac/tanne/shep. i'm not a big yell at the caller i enjoy conversational. hope that answered your question.
DannyParkins,but this isnt worth celebrating yet. being a 7 seed in the east with no clear path to a superstar or title contention has the potential for nba hell. bright side is lauri  wcj still have high ceilings  zachs contract is a great asset plus they have no long term bad money.
DannyParkins,i gave 2 to a father/daughter on the train in a sox hat so i only left a pair to this saturdays #whitesox game near dearborn  polk on the bar louie deck... however i left $20 cash so your first beer is on me. its a jose abreu bobble head game. go!
DannyParkins,didnt mute you. mccarthy had a hof qb and didnt evolve and keep up with the changes to the game around him which if youve read the redemption pieces he admitted with the work hes done while hes away. so not sure what gotchya moment you think youve pinned me in here.
Gingfacekillah,i agree with much of what rob said. especially his tips on getting started. low limits and off markets are what you want to focus on. too many get torched by starting in a highly efficient liquid market. give your skills a chance to catch up to the competition before firing hard.
Gingfacekillah,another interesting idea in this paper was the implication that the nba markets are converging on the maximum prediction ceiling.  it is  proposed by the author and other researchers that this ceiling is ~75 percent . closing line is ~71 percent . not much room to split the difference. have a read.
Gingfacekillah,having run some out of sample forward-looking tests full kelly seems to produce some insanely nerve-wracking variance. with flat  percent  and decent odds you will almost always be up $ if your up in wins. no so with kelly. could be 10-5 and be down $30k if your est. edge was large.

logan_matthews9,jurgen was not a good manager - from tactics to sessions theres hard evidence to say he struggled across the board on the day to day stuff. in many ways the opposite of berhalter. but in the large scope of things i believe what he did during his time is extremely impactful
PikachuBets,but go on keep selling the dream and making people believe that paying you to enter their shitty ass picks into a guaranteed monies contest is worth their money and time. also keep showing off dat wad of cash on tv in your car! keep buying hooks keep hanging with lv touts
PikachuBets,if you werent such a fucking fraud scum tout then ppl wouldnt hate. going on interviews talking like youre a hotshot but all you do is peddle bullshit like i grind so hard and you just need to know when to get out and then justifying touting. just fucking stop you skinhead

PikachuBets,"the problem:

you: ""i am so smart so much sharper than the market that if the market moves against me i'm not worried. in fact i love when this happens bc it means i like my play even more and now there is more value.""

rest of the world: ""you're retarded bye"""
adamchernoff,of course not but in 60-90 seconds on air only so much can be presented. the vulnerability discussed (not in the video) is ne is well equipped to run tempo which negates the phi defensive advantage. ne could well be the right side but everyone betting it is paying a steep price.
adamchernoff,the average edge priced into a basketball teaser is just slightly lower than the worst odds you will find on a max pick card in keno. i believe the difference in hold for bookmakers is about 4-5 percent  different. there is not a worse bet in sports than a teaser in basketball.
adamchernoff,i am not challenging you nor doubting you. i am just asking what the limit is because i do not know the answer to the question. i am sorry that children that discuss gambling on twitter have made it so any question that is asked is deemed to be challenging or insulting.
adamchernoff,disclaimer. i bet on football. i am not a scientist nor am i a conspiracy tin foil hat guy. but i have lived through about ~20 winters in saskatchewan  alberta and never have witnessed an 8 day span that saw a 20c day (70f) bookended by two blizzards at -8c (15f)...in october.
adamchernoff,love watching shanahan. goodwin motion around the back looks like nothing but as he came around both lbs took a side step left to put them a step out of position right at the block to open a hole. every guy moving for sf has an impact. so well thought out. beautiful.
adamchernoff,"let us  again keep it basic an assume that all adjustment was made on bal. if you add 10 percent  to the original 0.531 number for rsw that gets 0.631. 

16*0.631 = 10.09 wins. 

while win totals are not efficient numbers the relationship between teams and price point is very real and..."

adamchernoff,it is a really interesting discussion. now i may be going off the wrong path here but how do you feel about beer ads during sports? i feel like beer gets associated to brand rather than the act of drinking while gambling gets associated to the act of betting rather than odds.
kellyinvegas,well i cant just go on tv/radio and say the math says x so backing up the number with stats and trends help you make the case. how boring would it be if i was just like the math is the math and stood there with a blank stare into the camera
ToddFuhrman,"i've always found week 2 to be one of the most challenging when handicapping college football.  

you have to trust your preseason prep but  daily fantasy sports  want to over react (or under react) to one data point since  college football  teams make their most improvement from game 1 to game 2"
ToddFuhrman,great point. keep waiting for the phone to ring and hoping alabama clemson georgia and ohio st can come to orlando for a game because theyre seeking out a game. if you believe youre a top program play anyone you can wherever you can and dont hide behind a 1 for 1
ToddFuhrman,i know some of the sharpest guys i talk to have them #1 so i have no problem with them being there.  they have solid non-con wins but always remain an enigma in march given how poor the wcc is but they're more than capable of cutting down the nets in minneapolis
12Xpert,thanks. average 1.166. on that data alone  that is  a strong case for saying there are some players for which usual xg rules  daily fantasy sports  apply. arguably there should be an extra weighting applied to their xg to account for their finishing ability. obviously hard to know when to apply it.
12Xpert,think about it. why do 2 people engage in a contract. 1 buying. 1 selling. the both can't be right about the price. if there is commission involved likely both will be wrong. but the still do it. why? are the irrational? financially yes. but they play to play not to win.
12Xpert,still making silly noises every time a tip wins? what sound when you lose? i could beat your record just guessing 1 in every 4 times. the second number seems to be getting lower. the first time i heard you breaking the sound barrier it was 11 then 9 now 4. hmmmm.
12Xpert,but to be a proper fan you can't ignore infinity. to be a proper fan you would be happy to bet your whole life against liverpool winning. they lose you double your life's worth (if this is an even-money wager); they win you lose everything but have the pleasure of their win.
12Xpert,really bottom line for me now is that whatever anyone tries to do here to make this sector of the gambling industry a better place for people there will always be some looking to exploit and others stupid enough to be exploited so not sure doing a new project will add anything.
12Xpert,a though experiment. suppose bookie offers a market on a coin toss (they do in the form of odd/even e.g.). suppose  it is  random who bets what side so expected is 50-50. using binomial with odds of 1.95/1.95 and 100 bettors there's a 38 percent  chance bookie is exposed (52/48 or worse).
12Xpert,sample was same as last week (54615 odds from 18205 matches). i do realise that i'm still kind of comparing oranges with lemons really we need either 538's odds at closing or we need pinny's odds at the time 538 publish their predictions. but still  it is  of some value i think.
12Xpert,most importantly here the winning or losing of such a bet by either side does not prove one way or another what i and others have asserted which is that these systems are just flawed data mining projects. maxi if he wants to has to prove he holds +ev in other ways.

mschwimer,"it is indeed. i have always been one to have big dreams. so far every dream i have had 99.9 percent  of people have doubted. but they have all come true. 1. being major leaguer. done 
2. being ceo of a $100m company. done. 
3. being the world wide market maker (tbd)"
mschwimer,if you dont think we will win give me one logical reason you wouldnt sign up for the 4 week package. zero ncaa basketball. $900 for  200+ recs. if we lose you get $2000 back (including fee). why on earth wouldnt you do this unless you dont believe a thing you say?
mschwimer,thats the best part about full transparency. no angle to find. if you believe in us. sign up and play our recs. if not sign up and dont play them. only people that should not sign up are people that believe in us but can only play $20 per game or so.
mschwimer,ty rufus. situation - cardinals vs. mets last night. i had over 7 and cards ml. score is 4-2 going into the 9th. cards score 2 in 9th to tie it at 4-4. game gets suspended and will pick up today. fanduel says both plays still are still pending. what say you?
RufusPeabody,this tout releases a number of picks. on some the line moves in their favor (i.e. from +7 to +6.5). this could be bc they have many subs betting a good reputation or sharps are considering their opinion but the point is there is not market resistance to these picks. (2/6)
RufusPeabody,"scenario 3: georgia loses one more game in the regular season but wins the sec championship game. this one is a virtual coin flip. we would still give an edge to an sec west champ that runs the table before losing to uga.

playoff prob: 45.9 percent"
RufusPeabody,the hard rock app gave me fits. it kept freezing up. but they took 2.5k on rsws but i had to go into the casino.  shocked me with 5k on golf round matchups but i got the boot that day.  gave me $600 on rsws which then got cut to $400.
RufusPeabody,i was told when depositing $$ into  that i would not be able to withdraw the money unless i bet 50 percent  of the deposit amount. and that isnt to claim a bonus. its their policy. meaning if someone deposits $500 and then decides they want the $500 back no bueno.
RufusPeabody,question: you mentioned some people not betting the recommended amt. are you including bettors who weren't able to bet the $300 per pick because limits for first half  college basketball  totals are $250 at betcris the book whose prices you use. that is the market you all actually did well in.
SportsCheetah,his vertical gravity was underappreciated and he accounted for *i believe* 36 percent  of fox's assists. dedmon and bagley  daily fantasy sports  have that ability. i think that could be something they miss (also sets up their shooters with looks when  it is  a threat). 2nd best netrtg on the team.

capjack2000,he seems like a big enough astros fan that i'm sure he still believes they can win. however what he's really doing is hedging a bet on wsh (via the mattress sales) with his hou sports wagers. right now he's in a good position to profit more with the mattress sales.

dinkinc,he had a relationship with a tout company that got in trouble for being an agent for a pretty unknown book.. the story was they charged customers for picks sent them to this book and got a kickback if they lost. wish i remember names. touts were from fort myers fla.
dinkinc,3-0 with a push... i am going to stop six days early. recently had lunch with  and we discussed burnout .. we thought going out on top is the best way b4 a break.  it is  been an amazing month and an incredible year. for those who played please donate to
dinkinc,the two horses who got legit fouled didn't object....a horse who barely got touched was the objecting party.... stewards look bad if they place the horse second [ obviously wrong ] or must admit they dropped the ball if they place him further back [ missed obv dq] thus the delay
RASPicks,i'm on record stating that what we release is less than 10 percent  of our total volume in a year which includes other play types/markets that we  daily fantasy sports  offer a service in. my point of contention is the notion that our unreleased stuff is better. that would be something.
RASPicks,if you increase both sides by an equal percentage (multiply true odds of both sides by 1 + hold percent ) the difference in the implied odds and true odds for favorites compared to that of the underdog will increase in size as the odds get more lopsided for the favorite.
suuma810,kamu grugier-hill's comments go beyond trash talk. this might be the motivational spot of the year - #eagles off an sb win beat them 37-9 in arlington last year and can be taken out of the playoff picture. expect the #cowboys to bring it all on sunday. line moving towards -3.
suuma810,i think you got my intention. do his good plays outweigh the bad ones? if you think/know so how to measure it? to me it seems like the bucs could maintain a lot more drives and score more points if not for his boneheaded throws. 13/33 targeting desean seems kinda odd.
ClevTA,for one nobody knows how the qbs will fall in this draft so its impossible to say they arent bad enough to draft one of those guys. nobody knew mahomes watson lamar teddy etc were going to fall too. also u can trade up u arent stuck with your draft position.
ClevTA,only a wall would respond with the only thing that matters is scoring and clock doesnt matter. that means u have literally never watched an nfl gm before. how could u possibly not think clock matters? u do realize u are allowed to do both score  bleed clock. its very simple
spanky,i disagree.  we have lots of pieces and we earn. its just hard to follow a service releasing so many plays. its a pain in the ass and a chore to do all the work and put in plays every day. and on top of all that work youre losing money.
spanky,"you can't keep asking to have a call when its clear there's no interest. stop yearning for approval.
majority of cats on here hate me but best believe every bookmaker takes notice when i bet. respect is earned over time. if the work is strong it will eventually speak for itself."
spanky,"a dollar in 1999 is worth about $1.50 today.

you would think sports betting limits would have increasedor at least stayed the same in 20 years.

the sad reality is limits overall have gone down.

5 and 10 dime outs were standard back then. now they are hard to come by."
spanky,"well said. there is no easy path.  

compare it to cooking. you can try it yourself but youll never create top quality food. instead give the ingredients to a chef sit back and let him expertly prepare your meal. 

give me your outs sit back and watch the $$$ roll in."
spanky,"so how do you achieve + closing line value? 

1.)team analysis
2.)market analysis

majority of my betting is #2. #2 has the worlds best cappers indirectly working for me. i never have to keep my model fresh or risk losing my edge.  i am also able to expertly bet multiple sports"
spanky,"ive seen rufus debate issues in person and agree to disagree.  
he gives everyone the benefit of the doubt. hes even asking for touts long term records to prove himself wrong about the tout industry. looking for the good in others rather than the bad is a good quality to have"
spanky,every offshore book i play in has limits clearly displayed for sidetotalml per sport. us books should be required to do the same and stick to them! theres a max sign on every table game why not in the sportsbook!? deposit amounts and who i give most business depends on limits.
spanky,great listen. no hard feelings   disagreement is cool but the word dumb was a bit extreme.  your apprenticeship ban is lifted.  one day when we meet i hope to validate all the nice things you hear about me and for you to discredit all the crap i hear about you. jkjk
spanky,got a chance to meet kristian nylen ceo of kambi. real nice guy. i relayed my concerns about being limited to 10 bucks on nfl sunday and being kicked out of draftkings.  he listen and we exchanged business cards. hopefully things can get better not just for me but for everyone.
spanky,moving on air will never go away.  if an injury flashes i cant blame a bookmaker for moving on air.  what youre talking about is delayed confirmation where the bookmaker uses their sharp customers as a line service and doesnt even write a bet. i 100 percent  agree that is bullshit
spanky,touts use subscription money as a safety net for their own gambling.  the best bettors in the world do not tout because no safety net is required.  one is better off educating themselves than relying on someone who has nothing to lose.  -110 is hard. -110 plus tout fee is harder.
spanky,when i was coming up in the business i made alot of money (on multiple occasions) betting against the 76ers when iverson was shooting craps all night at the taj mahal in ac till 8am.  there are many intangibles not reflected in numbers.  you just have to know where to look...
spanky,happy chinese new year to all my asian friends! you all are what make gambling what it is today.  special thank you to all my asain betting partners who have supplied me with a consistent stream of outs to help my business prosper!  gong hei fat choy! gong xi fa cai!
spanky,with the hard rock ac opening their sportsbook i'm thinking about heading over there this weekend or next.  this is the only sportsbook left in atlantic city that will book my action.  will they turn out to be the sole bookmaker in ac or join the other dressmakers? we shall see
spanky,lol it happens once a year rob. this is not a recurring event..  i ate this black and blue burger at bobbys burger palace and i think the blue cheese was either left out or was from the 90s.  it tasted funky but all blue cheese tastes funky... paid the price
spanky,watching that entire jak pit sequence at the end was the most unbelievable turn in raw emotion i have ever seen in my life. grown men jumping up for joy one minute and then cursing the next minute. guys who were crying before are now dancing. the entertainment value is priceless!
PlusEVAnalytics,has your view on closing line value changed? its strengthened mikes argument that closing line value is not important because of the disparity between his closing line value and his results. prefers to use actual game results normalized for randomness like free throw percent  and judge by margin in expected points.
PlusEVAnalytics,i think whats driving a lot of the controversy around ncaa rankings is a poorly defined question. what are these rankings attempting to do? its clearly not identify the best teams otherwise a 1pt overtime win and a 1pt overtime loss would count almost exactly the same. so what is it?
aluckyaday,if the results are replicated for the next 20 years i.e. a record of 660-560-60 the chances of a random monkey having that record or better would be 0.26 percent . still not fantastic but about 1 in 400 is a bit better than 1 in 4 monkeys beating the computer!
aluckyaday,if you presented to the public the account history of someone who is 10000 up by luck and someone who is 10000 down but bets with positive expectation and asked them to choose which one was the winning punter that had been banned by the bookmaker would they get it right?
aluckyaday,without inbuilt delays it becomes a technology race. who has access to the data fastest (not always pictures in courtsiding tennis its a guy in the stadium) and who can process them the fastest. that is a big risk for the books when a simple delay eliminates most of the problem.
aluckyaday,its how they get the squares though. us books have been protected in the past with limited places squares can bet. to get them now you have to compete with the softs offering free bets loss leader prices and promotions. almost impossible if you are going to book sharps as well.
aluckyaday,i think these bets can be categorized in two. bets for entertainment and bets from vulnerable people. the issue is there is a fine line between the 2 which can easily crossed. i  daily fantasy sports  think the industry has yet found the balance  between encouraging 1 and discouraging the other.
aluckyaday,the problem with doing it that way is you need a much larger history to be sure its not just down to luck. depending on the price range you are betting at it could be 1000s if not 10s of 1000s of bets.  has written quite extensively on this as well
aluckyaday,but in reality it does not work like that. people have dreams of playing in the nfl. they have no chance of getting there and they know that. they play the game because they enjoy it. same with sports betting. soft books cater to their needs. sharp books cater for pros.
aluckyaday,not had time to build up a recreational base yet. i doubt the current profile will look anything like it does now in a years time. will be interesting to see if the tax take grows in line with handle. how do they tax smaller bets?  percent  of hold or handle?
aluckyaday,the next thing to do would be to look at uk consumer law to see if the terms and conditions are fair. this is subjective and would have to be decided by the judge. what would the consumer understand by the term related contingencies? i'll leave that one to the judge!
aluckyaday,your view or do you have data? some recreational will get caught in the cross fire but that does not mean it is not the right strategy. they have the data billions of bets millions of accounts. pretty sure they know how to run their business better than you or me!
aluckyaday,they have been doing it for a long time in europe. they have plenty of data. i  daily fantasy sports  really see it as predatory. you just have to accept them for what they are entertainment companies not bookmakers. they serve the recreational market very well giving people what they want.
aluckyaday,missed a lot of the chat not really my kind of bet. find the concept interesting though but if something sounds too good to be true.... the guarantee is based on bookmaker odds. can you actually get them? if they are successful i would think slippage would become a big problem.
aluckyaday,you have to get the person to admit they have problem for self exclusion to work. limits are good but again they require the player to set them themselves so are not ideal. difficult to find a solution that protects but is not so intrusive it deters players without a problem!
aluckyaday,this is quite a good example of an issue with exchanges. they work much better in 2 way markets. exchanges require liquidity i.e. price makers. recreationals tend not to do this. but in a 2 way market a price taker on one side is automatically a price maker on the other.
aluckyaday,nowhere near as much as it used to do admittedly early betfair liquidity is pants. restrictions are one reason but not the only one. are saying if pinnacle put up an arb with a soft it would not get taken? that the soft would just be taken as a value bet?
aluckyaday,if you think that you did not read it! exchanges are not what the betting public want. they might be a great idea but if recreational punters  daily fantasy sports  like what they offer they will not be a commercial success. bookmakers/exchanges can only exist in a world where punters lose.
aluckyaday,long time since my a level physics but.... force required to keep an object moving = kinetic friction * normal force. normal force = m*g. so proportional to mass. because the distance of a race is large compared to the winning margin a small effect over a long distance is enough
aluckyaday,yes but i would think (guessing) the majority that bet on horse racing are casual bettors (more than 30 percent  anyway!) betting on a saturday and big meetings rather than the ones that bet most day. need a friendly book to give you real figures. what percentage bet horses most days?
aluckyaday,very true. in the bigger picture i think sp is still very important to the recreational punter who can get bog. i have seen many times at smaller meetings prices of horses backed early in the day that then drift contract again late on course without the same late exchange move.
EdMillerPoker,"i agree with this and i do perceive some pervasive industry blind spots about how to piece this all together

many industry folk are quick to dismiss good ideas that are either foreign to them or that they perceive are bad ideas due to seeing them poorly implemented once or twice"
EdMillerPoker,"again this is beside my point. not worth arguing it bc you won't convince americans. no american will read that william hill rugby story and think ""oh fair play correlated parlay go ahead and chop it  it is  just like a $1 car""

almost zero americans even those in the industry."
EdMillerPoker,this creates substantial adverse selection bias. because you get nearly 100 percent  of the bets you try to place that are bad for you (misclicks bad logic whatever) but a much smaller percentage of the bets you try to place that are good for you (you found a good number etc).
EdMillerPoker,fundamentally making picks and sweating them should not be expensive. there should be higher risk options for ppl who want to be more serious and try to really win something but the casuals should basically get to click as much as they want and have net cost fit in a budget.
EdMillerPoker,very unlikely they would maximize for things like hold percent . more likely they would look instead at handle and engagement and treat the gambling part as a way to add value to the media properties. this is a better industry model for everyone but it requires everyone to be smarter.
EdMillerPoker,yes the streaming delays are crazy at the moment. if you watch on tv its about an 18 second delay which is bad but with a timeout product if you open the markets when the game goes to commercial on your screen youll see what you want for a couple minutes.
EdMillerPoker,found out recently that my chess coach when i was a kid alfred carlin died last year. he was a special man. from what i know he taught himself to play as a kid and from that point he shared the game with anyone he could in new orleans for decades
EdMillerPoker,nm x2 they have parlays listed in a totally counterintuitive way on this thing so who knows. tried to add up all the bankrolls on the scoreboard but couldn't figure out how to paste it into excel in a way that wasn't stupid so really im just very bad at this

LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  think this fact bolsters your case. you seem to be treating it as high uncertainty about replay i look at it more as a stronger bias toward the call standing reducing the incentive to challenge.

JoeyKnish22,not trying to be a prick here but for a couple guys that pride themselves on accuracy you mention fields for heisman and allude to him being the front runner (not remotely the case). just if ppl are taking this podcast info as actionable it was not the most nuanced discussion.
JoeyKnish22,"lsu was identified last week as a play on future and against the spread wise before a big game.

LockyLockerson,"as part of the #1 seed comes ""wins."" the mvp's team averages about 61 wins/season.  61.  only westbrook has an mvp playing for a team that didn't win at least 50 (or have that winning pct in a lockout shortened season).  so again the list of teams is very very short."
LockyLockerson,"i wouldn't tell you to ever place a bet based on this trend but i just think this shows how different market opinion is on stanford than usual.

david shaw's been the coach for 8+ years he has only been a home underdog 4(!) times.  stanford has won all 4 outright."
LockyLockerson,"ok  let us  pick thru some week 1 games that have been bet into oblivion in some ways already.  widely available things i still like:

DannyParkins,khalil mack is a better player and it was a historic move in terms of both draft capital and dollars for a defensive player. mitch trubisky will be the move that likely defines paces tenure. but in terms of value ill be very surprised if ryan pace ever surpasses eddie jackson.
DannyParkins,you know one morning host lives on the north shore and the other lives in indiana and i live in the city right? not sure why any of that should matter though. what dont i get about the listening base of the city? open to honest dialogue here if you are.

Gingfacekillah,for the nba its frequently much tighter but i'd encourage you to take a look. certain spots can be ev+ if you pick them carefully. european basketball is somewhere in between  college basketball  and nba. i'd suggest starting with  college basketball  with this to get used to seeing the pattern first.
Gingfacekillah,"one takeaway in this victory is that the market spent a lot of time kicking tires on this spread between 2 2.5 and 3 all for naught.  not particularly efficient. 

it is well worth the time and effort to make your own forecasts / lines. books handicap bettors more than teams."
Gingfacekillah,what would be even more interesting is if those same 6 teams were: 1) the largest fan bases 2) the most profitable fan bases in $ value or 3) received the most $$ on wagers. last year for ex the higher value market won 70 percent  of nfl playoff games. interesting.
logan_matthews9,thought this was very good.  has a great story that is relatable and very useful for any up and comer - hit weak markets while you build your bankroll. no need to jump in trying to beat nfl. first time listening to the podcast but thought the whole crew was good
logan_matthews9,im not a pro - nor will i ever be with my day job - but grinding a profit gambling and spending 16 hours a day doing it are not mutually exclusive like some touts want you to believe. heres a short checklist to get as close to profitable as possible:
logan_matthews9,"it is  worse than not ""quite right"" - both ramos and stewart are dual nationals. that they would have some sort of bias towards mls/""pure americans"" is fucking ludicrous. berhalter spent eight of the past 25 years in mls and the rest in europe. he's wrongly typecast as an mls guy"
logan_matthews9,i dont get this - hes maybe the fifth best rb in the pool at the moment and hes coming off a call up to the u20s where he played a cycle up... i dont think us needs to do more than that to keep a player of his age/caliber satisfied

PikachuBets,it is absolutely delusional to say that going to college is not the de facto expectation of kids growing up today with pressure from family friends teachers the whole bit.  i do not know  where you grew up or who your friends are but your n=20 or whatever doesnt reflect reality.

adamchernoff,people mistake isolation for solitude. solitude is slots (different topic). isolation is the connection between you and your bet. what do you hear what do you see? because the tv's are all in the same spot and elevated you can sit and not move for hours and hear the main game.
adamchernoff,not too concerned about the qb spot. colts this year as a team rank bottom third of the league in most major categories in comparison tables. five wins by a combined 20 points as well. bettors love how smart the team works but overall 5-6 poor performances of 7 this year.
adamchernoff,i have yet to see a consensus report that is not fabricated show the liability and handle of straight bets in comparison to parlays teasers and any secondary wager types. in my experience often times more than 50 percent  of the total handle was from non straight bets. some us states...
adamchernoff,so in short. not much in terms of monday night football  results. it would have to be extreme or feature a key injury. but more movement would be likely off of a extreme cin result vs an extreme pit result just because of how the market will shape up next week.
adamchernoff,self scouting myself over the past twelve years of betting/booking nfl but also looking back at how things have changed betting the nfl today is far more about bettor vs bettor than bettor vs bookmaker. i used to look at a full card of sixteen games each week and shave it...
adamchernoff,not even close. mobile apps/plans and options too. pricing is very different too. here in vancouver i pay $195 a month for basic cable with sunday ticket and 500gb of home internet. wife and i pay $280 for two phones and share 8gb of mobile data. cant compare to us rates.
adamchernoff,despite the 1h under win this is the part of the write-up i value. the betting market is always clamouring over mcvay but when it matters he and goff (especially) have a long long way to go. even with the extra week it was a weak and poor game plan throughout.
adamchernoff,i didnt delete it i just muted your tweets so i dont have to see them. had saints -2.5 in my large teaser of the week which covered in addition to -8 for half of the stake. thanks for taking the time to listen. good luck next season with your team.
adamchernoff,"please whatever you do today do not make a wager on a team because ""they need to win to stay alive"" or ""they need it more"". 

not only is guessing on the motivation of 53 highly paid athletes foolish but any useful information is without a doubt priced into the market."
kellyinvegas,i cap all of my games. if the number moves with my side im happy (reverse line move). a) i got the best of the number. b) the public is probably on the other side. i never need to keep it interesting in my life. have plenty of excitement as is
ToddFuhrman,ha nascar was a rough season to say the least and own that.  hockey is where i have an edge and will continue to bet that way; you'll never see me bet differently than i would in real life just riding out the rough patch and some dicey early season reads
TheCousinSal,"merry xmas degenerates! my best bets:

- pats (-140)

- white to lead in rec. yds. (10/1)

- gary russell special: james develin will score a  touchdown  (+375) 

- gronk to get arrested tonight for public urination inside a waffle house (3/1)

- i will lose every bet listed above (-850)"
12Xpert,"there will always be ""fresh meat"" hence  it is  a great concept for the betconnect owners  it is  just i'm not particularly convinced that  it is  of sustainable value for non pros. initially it might be for pros but if the non pros get banned and become non pros then what?"
12Xpert,sorry jeff but  that is  just crap. if you hate his politics deconstruct them. i imagine his children wouldn't like seeing this.  it is  this sort of shit endlessly filling social media that slow divides a nation. why  daily fantasy sports  you give him a hug instead of wishing he died.
12Xpert,i didn't exclude anything. i picked a date. i neither chose to exclude nor chose to include. i just picked a before date and then looked to see how those who were still there are done in the intervening period and compared it to how they had done before that date.
12Xpert,as for liquidity it has nothing to do with anything. go to a casino. bets by players will not be random. they'll be using all sorts of nonsense money management. will also be causally related to income risk tolerance and addiction. but  that is  nothing to do with the game maths.
12Xpert,that depends on the performances. we are back to p-values again. ultimately you will never know for sure if a tipster is skilled or even was skilled and is no more. i think you need to apply a scatter gun approach in looking for numerous signals that are indicative of skill.
12Xpert,oceans absorb a lot of co2 but over hundreds/thousands of years will put a lot back into the atmosphere. in theory that might hold the planet in a much longer interglacial. might there be another return to ice age? maybe i suppose at least if it happens it would be delayed.
12Xpert,0-0 after extra time the uk would have to keep retaking its penalties every time the score one on the grounds that they hadn't scored it the right way so had to do it again until they missed and then it was the right way. final score 3-0 to the eu.
12Xpert,just a lot of nonsense. why would anyone pay such fees. based on the historical records of the 103 tipsters you could copy now you pre-cost expected roi is about 1 percent . about half have been profitable half not. you know where i'm going with this  daily fantasy sports  you.
12Xpert,but you still haven't answer my original question which i think  did for you. he said since buying this system became an option  it is  failed. so what i want to know is whether all bets before that were available in real time or whether  it is  all just back testing

JambosPicks,the beautiful part of this is we post all our records. good and bad. if you care about the 17 week package that record is on our site.  if others care about our history that record is on the site as well.  that is what being fully transparent is all about.
mschwimer,several things wrong with this.  you say you asked for the report and we didn't provide it? we have provided the cohnreznik report to everyone who has asked for it.  please show any evidence that you reached out and we did not provide it.  or please take that false claim down.
mschwimer,not sidestepping. will answer that question at length and in great detail. it requires a conversation with a leading expert in the field. i believe jeff is perfect for that. because a lot of people have a lot of respect for jeff. when jeff agrees with me maybe they will listen.
mschwimer,i only ask because i would personally love to have a conversation with them. if they really want to talk about it i am happy give them a piece of my mind. what these guys are doing is beyond awful imo. a reason you dont want to name them? just curious.
mschwimer,thank you. it does not. reason is because we want to be the opposite of touts. dont want to be in a situation where we are -7 units and last game of the week we get accused of making a 8 unit play to catch up. everything 1 unit for us.
RufusPeabody,congrats to all my dc brethren! i used to be a bitter orioles fan but after seeing what the nats fan base has been through in the playoffs this decade i found myself rooting for them -- because more nats interest = more masn money for the o's obviously ;)
RufusPeabody,"summary of bruce allen press conference. 

reporter: what's your accountability for the last 10 years?

ba: we're all in this together. we all want what's best. i brought in the best players. the coaches all work so hard. check their time sheets. no one wants to win more than me."
RufusPeabody,but ultimately michael and i had different goals. i told him then as i've told him now that there were fundamental issues with the pick-selling model that could not be avoided especially if you want to scale. i gave advice on how to limit those as best i could. (3/x)
RufusPeabody,"dear mr. hill

thank you for the lovely note; your reaching out means a lot. id be glad to confirm my email address if youd be so kind as to allow me back at  family gatherings. give my best to the rest of the family.

your (twice removed) cousin
rufus"
RufusPeabody,i know i'm a broken record on the tout thing. i know touts won't go away. my hope is that the needle moves in the right direction for consumers. that transparency will beget more transparency and become an expectation.and that scammers will stand out like a sore thumb to everyone
RufusPeabody,seth i ran a gazillion sims sampling from a range of diff offered odds with expected edges uniformly dist'd from 1-15 percent . in one set edges were known. in another they were mean of a distribution which i sampled from. with fully kelly there is really no difference long-term.
jeffma,the main difference and why i deeply respect preston is that i know he has a winning process and makes his living from actually betting. for me that is the difference. he is a real successful long term bettor. if his stuff on chalk and or daily wager suck over...
jeffma,i havent followed their picks. this really isnt an argument about who is a better handicapper. for those that bet all that matters is your p/l and no one but the bettor knows that. my question is does their info make people money? in most cases that answer is no.
SportsCheetah,i was surprised looking at things this morning just how bad (league-average) tor has been with lowry and ibaka on the floor this season. both back from injuries now but the two worst net ratings on the team. a hou dd win without harden shooting a jumper would be awesome.
SportsCheetah,the best bets collectively have been bad the last week and a half or so. it happens. to be fair i dont think anybody else that gives analysis claims to be a professional (but something we should try to get more of on the show in the future for sure).
capjack2000,"yes  that is  a common gotcha. another ploy is to advertise a redeposit bonus but the bonus amount must be  your avg wager. 

if you've been limited your avg wager is very small so your offered bonus becomes very small. 

haven't seen stuff like that in legal markets yet though."
capjack2000,"yes i play 2h in nba and  college basketball . you need to understand how the 2h line is made to approach those markets. 

wh will take over caesars via their deal with eldorado after the merger. 

its time for wh to loosen their approach and embrace the larger liquidity."
capjack2000,"yikes...ok need to clear some things up here and it may take more than 1 tweet:

nevada  all us states: a cash transaction greater than $10k warrants a ctr (currency transaction report).  it is  a fincen requirement. no tax withheld and no w2g issued unless it is 300x your wager."
capjack2000,"il sports betting resembles pa in that  it is  part of a much larger gaming expansion. 

the bad news: no state has been slower to market than pa (which approved sports pre-paspa ruling). 

the good news: there's more public pressure in il to get going than i saw in pa."
capjack2000,"if you are a $20 bettor now but you want to work harder think smarter bet better you won't be welcome.  it is  not the way us markets (any us market) operate. it is unfair to the aspiring bettor.

encouraging glass ceilings is discouraging the growth of us sportsbetting. 

3/3"
capjack2000,"update? 

not sure what you're looking for. if you're a marketer you'll realize that sites sell advertising for profit and  it is  easier when you have a set demographic. hence the seo. if knowing this invalidates my opinion on the industry then i'm not sure what else to tell you."
capjack2000,*if* it happens...and who is to say ny won't screw it up even then. look at pa. 2nd largest gaming jurisdiction in the us to nv. they passed sports betting in october 2017. last month they did $44.5m in handle; nj did $372m. legalizing it doesn't insure a viable market.
capjack2000,nobody is disputing that you can make a large cash wager in a book. however between ctr's and sar's any book would prefer you wire in the money. the fishy part of this guy's story is that he went to the bank and they just handed over $85k to him.
dinkinc,god bless america.  not canada france or spain.  we dont want you in our country. we know that youre just a pain .. from the mountains to the valleys white christians are the best . were not racist or xenophobic but others fail the test #trumpsongs.  waiting at the dentist
dinkinc,she said yes and was an awesome guest.. after that we became friends... then close friends...she never missed another pwg show and became a part of our regular crew.. being a lifelong wrestling fan she decided to give wrestling a try as her storied mma career was winding down 2/3
dinkinc,amazing.... i know the product will not disappoint and that you are much sharper so what happened to wcw will not happen to you....  my only suggestion would be to limit the hardcore matches as they are more likely to burn out than the high quality wresting ones. very exciting
dinkinc,it is  me .... i realized if i leave i could not raise money for the  horses and that is really the best thing i do with my life.. i also decided to stay true to myself on twitter and not let the disappointments run me off or change me
robpizzola,i  daily fantasy sports  work in news media. i bet on sports for a living. i can't get a real bet at 5dimes because they  daily fantasy sports  want my action. have a nice life... hope you sleep well at night knowing that you're scamming people out of hard-earned money.
robpizzola,jerry has been a friend of mine my entire life. he is not the brightest guy in the world but his passion is unmatched and he is a perfect example of what we should all aspire to be from a work ethic perspective. thanks for giving him a shout out.
robpizzola,probably should also point out the limitations with scoring chances and high-danger scoring chances. not all of them are created equal. if vegas is generating scoring chances that are 1.5x more likely to net them a goal which they did in l2 vs cgy you need to account for that.
RASPicks,thanks to those who have responded so far to the earlier job posting. we'll reach out no later than 5 p.m. et on friday to potential candidate(s). if you didn't sell yourself in initial email but want to try again feel free. you've got time. we'll read all of them.
RASPicks,there really are people who pad records with bo/cris openers props soft futures etc. where it would be difficult to get down 1-2 dimes or less even if you had hundreds of outs.  that is not us and has never been.  to portray us as such is disingenuous or naive.
RASPicks,"most know that 99 percent  of touts present zero value but reasons most people should not buy picks:
1) almost no one wins long term and unless you win yourself it is difficult to identify an actual winner.
2) requires time money management bankroll outs to justify cost of service."
suuma810,"#nfl betting tip

early in the week preferably earlier you should know at which price you would bet the  sunday night football  game. when you aren't interested by noon kickoff you shouldn't bet on it later on.  daily fantasy sports  let afternoon results dictate your betting behaviour in the evening."
suuma810,"you win a football game by scoring and teams who win in the playoffs score an average of 28.9 ppg while outscoring the other team by an average 14.6 - 8.5 in the first half and 13.9 - 8.8 in the second.

care about scoring not about holding the ball."
ClevTA,the way i look at it is dorsey wasnt terrible or anything he made some good moves and made some bad ones. if he insisted on keeping freddie another year thats a huge red flag. and in that case he wasnt so great as gm that he couldnt be replaced
ClevTA,wait u are starting laird? yuck hes awful. if u have obj or landry at wr id start baker. same with allen at wr for rivers. absent of all of that id go fitz bc he gets rush yards and no adams for jets. and find a new rb lol
ClevTA,"nfl picks:
- enjoy your coffee tomorrow with minshew bombs. too many cluster injuries for hou
- brace yourself with jameis
- haskins: 12 drives 2  field goal s 4 int 4.2 ypp  15 percent  1st d/play is so bad its substantially worse than the worst off in the nfl"
ClevTA,hey i need some help deciphering your boxscore on airyards. last night's gm the browns had a success rate on runs on early downs at 33 percent . late down runs were 40 percent . overall all runs were 32 percent . i need help how this is possible. thx
ClevTA,u are going to back ne and it will be 35-10 in the 4th q and u will have to sweat out fitzmagic late against hoyer running out the clock with branden bolden in 90 degree heat. i am staying clear from this gm but will watch for the entertainment
CizzlingSports,"two things u seem to be glossing over here: 1) sub would net $1100 ($2000-$900)  2) sub would have to buy three 4-week packages just to get even...

which cost additional $2700...

on top of the $3284  that is  already lost (assuming u pay two $300 guarantees of course)

spanky,"when i was coming up in the business the gambling forums helped me a lot with questions. 

since many of the same questions keep getting asked in my dm box id be happy to answer any questions on this thread.

hopefully i can help out.

wiseass-hater questions will be ignored."
spanky,the opening number today is stronger than its ever been. you cant beat the closing line if it never moves off the opening line.  as bettors we have the disadvantage of paying vig; but we also have the huge advantage of getting to pick and choose.  passing is a must.
spanky,this is the biggest problem every pro sports bettor faces. the winning becomes trivial. the ability to get down and not get chased is the ultimate obstacle. compare this to bj card counting.  counting is easy. the challenge is finding a game and milking it for as long as possible
spanky,i never directly take money from bettors.  however given this is a zero sum game i use technical analysis and line movement as a guide to make many of my bets.  i have more outs than anyone i have the best information and the fastest technology. originating is way overvalued.
spanky,for most of you this is a nonissue. i however have thousands of accounts and can not manually bet them all.  i designed software back in 2003 to bet multiple outs simultaneously. its ironic how in 2019 we all rely on technology yet 2nd tier bookmakers discourage its use (2/2)
spanky,youre 100 percent  right. i tell it like it is and give honest reviews. im not on anyones payroll... if im treated fairly ill give props. if im ostracized and treated like shit ill let it be known... for now i think  is awesome and i dont anticipate that changing
spanky,the sad part is i was born and raised in jersey city nj.  woulda been cool to bring things full circle and enter the  sports betting contest in the town i grew up in.  ahh and so it goes.   onwards and upwards.  good luck to all entrants and have fun!
spanky,for me minimizing risk is the secret sauce. when i bet mayweather to beat mcgregor i wasnt happy because i won my bet... i was happy because i didnt lose my bet....  despite your edge laying heavy juice is rarely the best long term strategy since your risk is higher.
spanky,nice one.what i meant to say was todays losers could very well be tommorows winners. i myself was a losing player before figuring it all out.  the crappy part is once you figure it out the winning becomes the easy part. finding bookmakers who will book you becomes the challenge
spanky,heres a video i forgot to post midday where my college football was cut from 20k to 10k. this of course is all before i was ultimately knocked down to 2k on college football. they say a guy named jeff made the call. im assuming that jeff is jeff davis
spanky,15 years ago there were many well respected lines managers making 6 figure salaries.  now most sportsbooks are on auto pilot copying lines from a handful of shops.  there are very few real bookmakers left who take a bet and move on action. the art of bookmaking is lost.  sad.
spanky,agreed that 10 percent  for 5 months is great but the vast majority of futures players are holding far less than 10 percent  and the vast majority of them dont have unlimited bankrolls.  most of my betting is done on credit and during football season its more precious than blood.
DocBettor,"this was down to +103 and +1 -110 at one point but then rockets money came in after the official announcements about davis and rondo being out. since i didn't feel like i had enough on the #lakeshow:

lakers moneyline +137
lakers +3.5 -107

i'm a bigger fan than   tonight"
PlusEVAnalytics,if youre a recreational bettor bet for fun not for profit. if you want action on a game and you dont want to make your own pick literally flip a coin. or even better take moneyline favs point spread dogs and unders. and never ever ever pay for picks. ever!
aluckyaday,"only if you give both sides of the story. why people are restricted. what effect that has on markets and promotions. how those markets would change if books were forced to accept bets. what effect that would have on recreational players and ""sharps"" who can only win at soft books"
aluckyaday,personally if i was using joseph's method i would not be removing the margin in a proportional way. because clvs are small small errors can have a large effect. i would assume all the margin is on one side. a worse case scenario and then see how the p looks.
aluckyaday,very difficult to tell when you are betting at bigger prices. luck hides the true picture. how have you done on the head to heads? should be less variance in the lower price bets. if the profit on those has shown the same decline there may be something in it
aluckyaday,it is done in the world tour all the time. even when it is not after a crash. it was discussed at length in the vuelta commentary this year. how can it be fair to disqualify an under 23 rider when their peers do it routinely at a higher level?
aluckyaday,you would hope there is space for both. but it did not really work out like that in the uk! soft book marketing/profits won the day. i have not seen much advertising yet when watching us sports channels. guessing my streams are not from nj? or are there advertising restrictions?
aluckyaday,re the future. sports betting is not financial trading. the underlying reason for sports betting is to make money for the bookmaker. it is not to convert a non liquid market in to a liquid one. book profitability is what will drive the future direction not the need for liquidity.
aluckyaday,for a bookmaker integrity of the market is not the issue they can restrict anyone who is faster than them. its having enough time for punters bet before they have to close the market. faster streaming will help with that but won't solve the issues of exchange in running betting
aluckyaday,isn't taking away choice from member states everything you are against in the eu  we elect our representatives to make these decisions for us. that is why we  daily fantasy sports  have referendums on everything. i blame the uk government for not protecting the uks interests not the eu itself.
aluckyaday,totally agree about not enough bets. but i believe people that have closing line value are winning because pinnacle are allowing them to do so. if pinnacle wanted to beat them they could. the very best can win without clv. they are the ones pinney spend money trying to beat.
aluckyaday,depends what the uk does regards tax and regulation. those funding brexit are banking on a low regulation low taxation state. probably the only way the uk will be able to compete for business. but if you live in the uk and want workers rights and public services your screwed!
aluckyaday,how much do uk softs restrict if you only bet 1x2? all my restrictions have been because of racing bets football is only ever recreational for me. i guess the softs here do not have access to the hugh team in red asian recreational bets to offset any sharp liabilities.
aluckyaday,i think spanky's methods are all about betting lines that are out of date have not changed fast enough on news etc. maybe that has worked in the us for the past 20 years where gambling had probably not changed that much. welcome to the european way of doing things!
joeytunes2,"by ""adjusting the odds"" in their favour (paying out amounts using odds that are less than what they determined to be the true odds) or by having a point spread bookmakers aim to guarantee a profit by achieving a 'balanced book' either by getting an equal number of bets for"
joeytunes2,ok. so why dont i sell picks.. simple i dont want 25$ i want outs and crying bookies and my partners to have extra money for nothing. thats what i want. # feed me  you see the work. ask your uncle neighbor butcher. pssh u know anyone who takes action
joeyisaks,"translation russian:

EdMillerPoker,"we're building each product and working out the kinks before we move on to the next one. so far so good. the response in september to the launch of our nfl and  college football  products was absolutely overwhelming.

within a couple weeks people were widely scraping us and moving markets."
EdMillerPoker,"seen the topic of in-play scalping come up a lot lately. just wanted to deliver a warning.

 it is  entirely possible if you see a +130/-110 scalp in-play that  it is  not +ev to bet either side.  that is  due to execution risk.

operators protect their in-play using delay/reject tactics"
EdMillerPoker,"periodic reminder that most sports betting ip is not very good and actual longterm value is near zero while a little bit of it is very valuable.

and that very very few people can tell the difference.

and that many acquisitions in the space will be people buying the garbage."
EdMillerPoker,"wanted to signal boost this great insight.

some corners of the sportsbook industry tend to think of themselves as adversaries to the players with their job to beat bettors as badly as possible every week.

we think the right idea is to offer value to both sides of the counter."
EdMillerPoker,"and this allows them to undercut the entire market by offering lower holds.

its industry dogma that customers dont care about hold and i agree theres some truth to that.

but then again the guys currently at the head of the pack also hang the lowest holds.

not a coincidence."
EdMillerPoker,because we aren't building a carnival game. we're trying to build a fair game that lasts. we know that the real success is when in-play betting enhances the fan experience. when people watch the game because they can bet on it and they bet on it because  it is  fun.
EdMillerPoker,i'm launching a company called deck prism sports   with partners and our goal is to be a lines provider to sportsbooks. in other words during a game when you open your sports betting app and see a betting line we want to be an originator of that line in real-time.
EdMillerPoker,people love to feel like theyre getting a deal or figured out a hack or whatever to get a little extra something other people miss. loyalty programs should clearly feature these little nooks and crannies (to a limit) bc the whole point of a loyalty program is to feel good
EdMillerPoker,"you 100 percent  can offer in-play betting without a delay and several books already do.

""if it is a free roll then why  daily fantasy sports  you get a licence and become a bookmaker yourself?""

without going into too many details this is more or less what i am doing."
nonrandomalpha,"""so why is the run game fading while the pass game rises? one factor being since 2014 an emphasis on defensive holding and illegal contact was implemented after the legion of boom in seattle held the best passing offense in nfl history to just 8 points in the super bowl."""
nonrandomalpha,well of course ucf can only handle playing an sec team a  maximum of once a year and its needs to be in january so they have all season to prepare while the sec gets worn down all season. in actuality this is the only way its a fair matchup.
LeeSharpeNFL,"a player getting cut doesn't mean they were a bad pick. you have more information when you cut them than when you pick them.

going off results subjects you to bias based on variance (and the draft has a lot of variance).

process predicts future results better than part results."
LeeSharpeNFL,books try to model where the market will be on a game. usually they're right (within a tolerance) and only move the line a little. sometimes when they get too much (for their risk tolerance) action on one side they correct and adjust the line. they're not perfect modelers either.
LeeSharpeNFL,"change and bug fix in my wp chart code:

(1) changed column name for team logos to reflect a change to my file to support another project

(2) sometimes nflscrapr shows na for wpa and my code to adjust it had a bug which is now fixed.

LeeSharpeNFL,"my wp chart script errors sometimes so currently automation is disabled. 

i'm working late so called my partner and talked them through how to find rstudio find the right script run it and read output to me.

they're not a math or code person but got there. i was impressed!"
LeeSharpeNFL,"sadly for life reasons i had to bow out of working on the big data bowl but i was analyzing it the rb's speed and acceleration *were* strong predictors so i guess that element matters.

but then again i assume coaches/scouts are already filtering out players who can't run fast."

JoeyKnish22,not just saying this cause they let me on the show weekly (for some reason). but theres not a sports gambling show with better guests and better content out there. and its not remotely close tbh. im an avid listener. if you are too  plz rate/sub keep the suits happy.
JoeyKnish22,is there no libey in this state. is there no freedom. i had a dream to one day place a legal spos bet in my own state. and we will not stop until we are free at last free at last by god let me fucking bet free at last
JoeyKnish22,not to sound like a prick here. and you know way more about this than i ever will. but the thought process is once the live models become good enough where you cant beat them liquidity goes way up and theyll become very popular just with the masses in general?
JoeyKnish22,"for what  it is  worth  that brings my preseason heisman bets to 3:

TheKostos,in the case of to the voters made it clear that its just as much about personal agenda as it is about you know the actual on-field product. credibility lost. i dont care if teammates/media didnt like him. i watched the games. 1st ballot hof. waited until year 3. pathetic.
LockyLockerson,"you might see a lot of players and think ""well maybe...."" but as predictable as every nba season is you'd be so wise to only target teams that can be the #1 seed at the end.  which is probably 2 teams in the east and maybe 5 in the west."
LockyLockerson,imagine saying a sport is in trouble and providing no evidence.  cfp title game was a blowout but during first half ratings were great.  new years games up in ratings when nothing is up ever.  more minutes spent viewing and discussing games than ever on all platforms.  just go away.
EliHershkovich,not saying edwards should've been a lottery pick but back-end guys like naz little and jordan poole struggled as well.  it is  about the full body of work and potential which he proved on the biggest stage. give me a guard or wing that dominated de'andre hunter like he did.

DannyParkins,"answer of course is there is none. 

same with mitchs 5th year option. does anyone honestly believe ryan pace hasnt already made up his mind?

but saying it now when theres some doubt could help in negotiations with mitch or other qbs. dont tip your hand before you have to."
DannyParkins,i do. i just dont get mad about the lies because theyre necessary. what competitive advantage does it give you to say we need to find a tight end in the draft or free agency because trey burton and adam shaheen have been failures and arent guaranteed a roster spot?
DannyParkins,ill get into the details on  and i dont know how many people disagree with this but its absolutely in the bears best interest for mitch to justify the 5th year option and end up being the qb of the future. will he? not sure. but thats best case scenario.
DannyParkins,we dont know what the resumes of the other 4 playoff teams would be though so thats impossible to say. there wont be 5 undefeated power conference teams. so youre saying youd take multiple 1 loss power 5 teams over clemson going for a 30 game win streak? come on.
DannyParkins,dude we haven't patted russell on the back once today assuming you're talking about us. please be honest if you're gonna subtweet the show. i said i hope he doesnt get an ovation was surprised they stuck by him and that he still isnt forthcoming in his answers. be. honest.

Gingfacekillah,"as a rating system elo will still ""work"" for  college football  but understand that my win percent  to point spread conversion in this model is based off of nfl data. you'd need to make some adjustments. i'd encourage you to tinker with it though and see what you can find."
Gingfacekillah,absolutely. there will be a paperback available as well at the time of release in august. the book will include lots of screenshots so people can follow along so i would think that digital might be easier to use in conjunction with the models  for what  it is  worth .
Gingfacekillah,this gave me an idea. what if we solved this with maximum likelihood? we tested the earnings of betting every outcome and used mle to adjust the estimated vig until the profit expectation was as close to zero as possible? im going to try this with solver just for fun.

PikachuBets,obv no one would give direct payment info but heres emails with one org. other one i checked with over the phone. both payments were made yesterday. i checked last friday and they had nothing. even berry admitted he thought it seemed silly to concede i.e. he didnt wanna pay
PikachuBets,"i think it is even more interesting that you tweeted a blog post asked people to ""tell you what they think"" but have not yet responded to a honest question inquiring about a comment you made about market value in the post. could you answer or clarify ""great contrarian value""?"

adamchernoff,"from the quick podcast story this morning. nine years ago today this was the ""casino"" where i started my first sportsbook job (if you can call it that) in the maraval district in port of spain. quite the shock for my dumb 18 year old self with enormous lavish expectations."
adamchernoff,what i am getting at is everything within all of the great sports books in las vegas follows the land based model which is tailored to speed isolation and continuity. the focus is put to prep the customers and in turn training staff becomes easy and the experience is seamless.
adamchernoff,on the surface level the cardinals appear to be deserving. arizona was +1.1 yards per play and +3.3 yards per rush. even with the -0.6 yards per pass differential these numbers do not suggest a 10 point difference. the play by play tells a different story. in a neutral game...
adamchernoff,it can easy to begin over reacting to line moves and tempting to bet immediately on them trying to beat the market. instead of doing this watch the prices and try to understand why it happened? was it info? cross check with rotoworld. were the limits bumped? check with books...
adamchernoff,kc presents when they play their best is top 3 in the nfl. they have struggled with three matchups because an enormous weakness has been exposed (again). however that matchup requires a specific game state and run of results early in a game to be exposed. in my opinion the...
adamchernoff,can easily add brown sugar instead of honey for sweetness. ribs are fun. ask to remove the membrane (or do it yourself). trim the ends. put on a good rub. keep the temp consistent 225-275  dont look. wait till you cant smear. wrap with bath. remove glaze put back. enjoy.
adamchernoff,"as a bettor i have found the best way to overcome the anchor is to think ""if i knew ten would be leading by 17 [at halftime in play] what price would i make them?"" instead of ""the adjusted spread is ten +13.5 a full 17 points worse than close""."
adamchernoff,you're right. i was generalizing but it depends. for example in a mid/high tier atp event with isner playing karlovic on hard ou touchdown oor the market will be far more efficient in reacting and pricing in what is coming. any hold will move a minimal amount off a 40-x.
adamchernoff,in a coin toss the probability is always 50/50. therefore if all bookmakers were offering coin toss odds any bet a bettor could make at greater than positive expected value / 2.00 would have a positive expected value (+ev) which suggests long term profitability if the bet is made consistently.
adamchernoff,agree however underdog bias - from the bookmaker - is a very real thing. starting to see more and more sports unevenly install margins on the dog where favs are slightly closer to true price. most frequently occurs on extremes though greater than 65 percent  and less than 35 percent
adamchernoff,trying to get the extreme high and low is very difficult to do unless youre directly influencing the numbers. i think too much focus is put on them (yellow) and not enough attention is put on the middle (green). its all about anticipating up and right or down and left.

buddy: f**k that sticking w/golf"
12Xpert,whilst i agree it will be the case that 80 percent  of losses will come from 20 percent  of customers (and this is recursive) this does not not imply that the bookmakers  daily fantasy sports  want leisure punters not does it imply that they want compulsive gamblers to keep gambling.
12Xpert,and by ordering all the 39 percent  bet together hopefully this gives an opportunity for more losing sequences to occur. but i'm afraid it doesn't. the outcomes are basically the same. so it seems it won't matter what distribution or order your exp rois are in only the average matters.
12Xpert,"no  it is  not 50/50 as i've explained in my book and articles but evidently you are either too stupid to understand anything that i say or too determined just to troll endlessly on this feed and interpret me as ""betting = exactly coin tossing"" for your own self gratification."
12Xpert,that is  kind of stupid on their part because i'd have thought you're far more likely to increase turnover if they offer you 2 percent  and make more profit from you. suggest to your account manager that you would certainly be increasing turnover by more than a factor of 5/2.
12Xpert,just to reiterate with so bets just a low yield and highish average odds we have really no idea if you have anything that you ultimately intend to sell for money. and  that is  taken  two years. pro tipsters need to have decent bet volume. without it they are pointless.
12Xpert,there doesnt need to be a border. its just rule-obsessed politicians who put projects ahead of people. boris has said there wont be a border from the uks perspective. no reason why there cant be a transition period with goods moving as now until a free trade deal is done.
12Xpert,he's going to outperform nearly all those who think that they can outperform him. there are people who say they bet for a living. most of those will go bust because they never actually had skills better than the pinny trader who's access to the most sophisticated models and data.

JambosPicks,i believe he is referring to you picking and choosing what weeks to count.  if you looked at our record from when we started selling picks schwim is correct.  if you want to arbitrarily decide to start counting our record in week 2 of selling picks then you are correct.
JambosPicks,thank you for the note that you believe we will pay if we lose. in terms of our success that is your opinion and its fair. we recommend you dont pay for a package but follow us so over time you can see for yourself. registering is free for everyone.
mschwimer,all suggestions noted. will talk to counsel. anything that we do not change that you suggested i will make sure i have a reason for not including it. again thank you very much for the help. predicting outcomes of games is our greatest strength. ts and cs are clearly not!
mschwimer,i agree completely! it is not a sustainable model at all. but it takes a lot of time for people to believe. probably a year or 2. when that happens lines will move and we wont be able to give advantages to our subs so we will shut it down.
mschwimer,yikes. connor you clearly have no idea how this works.  is the host of the show. period. he does not decide who comes on the show and certainly does not have anything to do with twitter handle decisions. also im done texting during the nba finals. series is too good.
RufusPeabody,bob: how much have the pats overperformed your expectation (based on your math models) coming off a loss? and i'm sure you could look at a more granular level in terms of over-performance in ypp play success epa... if  it is  something fundamental to pats why not model it?
RufusPeabody,"im not much better! i am a sports fan but most of what i talk about will be boring numbers.

im different from spanky in that a fundamental understanding of the sport is necessary for me to create the models i use. have to know what to look for."
RufusPeabody,took $300 initially on rsws but they said they'd bump me to 1k. when i tried my limits were still only $500. they raised my limits to 1k/bet but they had to manually raise them for each bet i wanted. they took to win 2.5k on r2 3-balls (golf)...
RufusPeabody,the friendly woman behind the counter who handled my deposit told me that people get upset at her every day about the policy. to her credit she made sure i knew before i deposited. but how many of the people upset about the policy are trying to launder money?
RufusPeabody,the twitter tout who's had a good first three weeks doesn't disclose the 14 other twitter accounts where he gives out different picks. he markets the one that got hot! consumers are at a huge information disadvantage when buying picks. be cognizant of what you  daily fantasy sports  know!
RufusPeabody,"jambos cares about the number of people who register.  that is  what they're claiming as their ""subscriber"" base. they also know very few people ever unregister for sites. if you  daily fantasy sports  want to be a part of jambos marketing campaign i highly recommend unsubscribing too! the end."
RufusPeabody,i know i have focused on the negative too much on here. i need to do a better job of highlighting the positives.  is incredible! their hold on multiway markets is far and away the best in the industry. 10k limits on props. and (unfortunately) some real sharp lines.
jeffma,you continue to prove my point with your flawed results based reasoning. just say in my opinion they should have kicked the  field goal  and calling zimmer braindead for making the decision was a knee jerk emotional decision because i had the vikings -3 and we can be done
SportsCheetah,alright thats why i made it a point to say i didnt bet the jets so it was clear. i dont know what they put on the graphics beforehand but i can try to work with that crew to be more uniform on a pass text or something similar.
SportsCheetah,it reminded me of stuff ive considered and given up. going out to a movie on a friday night with my wife for example. it took some time but im okay now giving up x percent  expected roi in-game betting hoops on a friday night slate to do that.
SportsCheetah,i can check later but a tie in this case for sf with a 1.5-game lead in the division increases their win probability pretty substantially. so would a 2.5-game lead though. probably just have to go for it without stopping the clock 3 times which they failed to do.
SportsCheetah,if it were him  it is  worth noting that tcu is 123rd in the country in explosiveness on defense against the pass... and that his target ratio in comparison to the rest of the wr group for the pokes is crazy high. it could be worth more than that.
SportsCheetah,yup good to be cautious. from our side/a new perspective on it is bettors are putting thousands of dollars into the betting market every week  so generally not going to be complaining about the inability to bet against ttu because of a bye week if the info isnt trustworthy.

capjack2000,"today's betting public is not price sensitive. they  daily fantasy sports  recognize the value of reduced juice. sharps do however.

capjack2000,"time for good news:

 is the best i've seen in nj at speed of withdrawals. each time the money is in my bank account less than 24h after requested (sometimes  12h).

capjack2000,"if they're going to be talking about props this much they really should talk about the vig. 

for those not in the philly area sixers simulcast some games on a betcast where the announcers strictly talk about betting implications of the current game.  it is  a work in progress."
capjack2000,"i left this out of the thread but fortunately these laws  daily fantasy sports  affect professional gamblers. their wins and losses are calculated ""above line"" on schedule c. 

filing as a professional is a whole other threshold and introduces se tax but for guys like us it is necessary."
capjack2000,"i could live on a diet of stories like this. previously to hear content like this you had to know which dive bar in vegas everyone was gathering at that week or you had to string them together on gill's podcast. 

so thank you twitter for times like these..."
capjack2000,just nj and de so far. pa goes live 7/15. njs online casinos have higher revenue than sports and it has grown significantly since sports started which signifies a crossover audience. shared wallets make it easy for one to win at sports and lose it back at the casino.

robpizzola,in doing some self-reflection i've realized that i tend to criticize others more often than praise others. i have tried diligently to change my attitude and to focus on positives rather than negatives.  it is  not always easy but i think i have made some strides in that regard.
RASPicks,we did 3 cancels during the release.  i believe one of them did move a tiny bit but it wasn't an intended play so it had no impact on the release.  none of the actual plays moved at all before the go from what i could see on screen.
VegasRefund,"cant feel great about gurley at 7/1 given his recent performance and usage.. the recency bias of cj anderson has eliminated any potential value. the last rb to win the mvp award was terrell davis in 1998.

ProfessorShine,losing picks isnt the issue. transparency is.   a customer should be able to easily view past performance over a large sample at wa lines.  it is easy to manipulate results.   this is why  has respect.  ras can have a bad year but at least he doesnt delete his plays
suuma810,"the potential starting offensive line for the #saints this week:

lg andrus peat
c cameron tom
rg larry warford
 ryan ramczyk

pit defense ranks 2nd in adjusted sack rate  2nd in qb hits produced. might be the key matchup."
suuma810,i get why people like the points with the home side here but i think the saints will cause too many matchup problems and i  daily fantasy sports  think the bengals will get them off the field. cin bottom-5 vs the run no can run away with a lead.
suuma810,"from weeks 3-6 #broncos edge rushers bradley chubb  von miller were on the field for only 70 percent  of the defensive snaps.  that is  criminal. jj watt coming off injury was 90 percent  on the field this season. 

over the past three weeks chubb  miller combined for 9.0 sacks."
ClevTA,maybe im in the minority but i have zero problems running the clock down there. odds are really low u score a  touchdown  with 10 seconds and one play with no tos from the 19. your risk is much much greater for a sack int or tackle in play.
ClevTA,seattle is 7-2 with only a +18 point diff. they have faced the 5th easiest sked in the nfl so far. based on pythagorean expectation they should have 5 wins right now. russ is my mvp right now bc the rest of that team esp the d is garbage
ClevTA,thursday night football  preview is up. i guess now u can ignore the coleman stuff since all 3 sf rbs are playing. sorry didn't take an against the spread side tonight. would love to take an in division dd home dog but its just an atrocious matchup for az.
ClevTA,nobody says not to run the ball. all ive ever asked and the data backs this up is to not be super predictable esp on first down. thats all. do things where the defense expects something diff. keep them off balance. thats what makes rams ne  no so great
ClevTA,for sure. when freddie took over last year they used 12 a ton and they were #1 in the nfl in success rate. obv with obj now i knew theyd go 11 more but thats just too much. if higgins is out id def would expect much less 11
CizzlingSports,which part of the above is hearsay? or we could start w/what information you have that could lead any reasonable person to conclude kelly offers value to the topic of betting. and if your parameters and protocols  daily fantasy sports  require reasonable diligence well then u got me there.

bookmaking 101 says go to -5.5 or -6 or some form of this depending on customer profile

bookmaking 102 says keep it -5 if youre confident on your number 

 copies the world to -4.5! complete monkey copy cat incompetence"
spanky,"""the more you expand your shopping search the better deals you will find""

line shopping is so trivial but yet so overlooked by so many aspiring bettors. 
it is easily the most important lesson one could ever learn not just from this book but in a sports betting education."
spanky,it aint about how much money.  i coulda retired yesterday.  i went to school studied finance and computer science. i started betting sports on the side. started making more money betting than at my regular job and the rest is history. i didnt choose this life it chose me.
spanky,there are two main ways to make money in sports gambling. you either 1.) extract money from bookmakers (pro bettor) or 2.) extract money from fellow bettors (touting).  option 2 is easy and guaranteed. option 1 is very hard and not guaranteed. my morals will always chose option 1
spanky,"i get a lot of advice questions for guys wanting to become semi-pro or even pro bettor.  

learn computer programming.  it is such a big thingnot just in sports bettingbut in every industry. data is everywhere and knowing how to process it all in a timely manner is essential."
spanky,in the per head era we are in there are mostly ticket writing offices prevalent.  therefore hitting the same office on the same line doesnt affect the same bookmaker.  if i have multiple accounts with the same bookmaker i never hit the same line with more than one account...
spanky,a few minutes after kickoff  called me and told me he was gonna bet his whole balance on under which would have won him the tourney.  you cut me off after i won and wouldnt even let me enter the tournament and now your inferior technology cost my buddy.
spanky,my buddy  just reminded me of a great bookmaker outta new york named fernando.  i was too young to see him book in ny but he ran hollywood sportsbook down in cr for years.  he was such a great bookmaker and an even better man.  i miss him dearly.
spanky,hey  1) i'll never be a tout 2) i have neither desire nor charisma to be a media darling 3) i heavily influence the college markets 4) i've been in this racket for almost 20 years- probably around the same time  was entering high school. thanks for the love
spanky,(2/2) nevada gaming should be made aware of this unscrupulous abuse of power to reject bets at will. this auto mover solution is for bookmakers who want to write business and not simply use sharp players as a line service. problem is there are very few real bookmakers left.
spanky,im driving in the uk and notice these cameras along the highway every mile or so.  i come to find out they monitor your average speed and will automatically issue a ticket even if you are 1 mile over the speed limit!  makes me thankful to live in america!
PlusEVAnalytics,so what youre really measuring with closing line value is how much the market is acting on the same information as you are but later. if the types of angles youre playing would cause that to be true then great - closing line value works perfectly for you. (2/x)
aluckyaday,why would they lie about having winning punters on their books? why would a book not want to keep a punter that hit a ten team acca with their first bet? its not the financial returns that are important re restrictions. its what/how/when you bet that gets your restricted.
aluckyaday,"its not what my sims show but i'm making assumptions about how people are using them. ""random"" lucky bets can be +ev but only under certain criteria. it would depend on how the bets are distributed across that criteria. people are probably smarter than i'm giving them credit for"
aluckyaday,yep. a point i keep trying to get home to the americans that keep proposing it over there. the sharp book market is global. if you want to open a sharp book then you are going to have to be better than pinnacle at it which wont be easy!
aluckyaday,although being no expert i would think they would be significantly less. i.e. the true odds of the double would be significantly less than the product of the two singles. therefor the bets are related and should be settled as two singles according to the terms and conditions 4/x
aluckyaday,tell that to 365. i think their shareholders are very happy. you are mis-representing things. $1 is not their limit on nfl sides. its the limit for bettors that they believe will not be long term profitable. the restriction may have nothing to do with their previous nfl bets.
aluckyaday,it is much more fun to go to work on a monday morning to say i hit the total qb yards first touchdown scorer and highest scoring quarter but missed the big pay day by 1 rushing yard rather than i lost my point spread bet by a point!
aluckyaday,i doubt he is an expert in the underlying causes of gambling addition. as he has said himself he is a campaigner. as such he should be able to back up what he is saying. all i'm asking for is the evidence he has used to make his decisions.
aluckyaday,"financial market makers also take positions but that is another story! as i said semantics ""the market"" implies only 1 market price. for a sports line there is not 1 market price. there are several prices dependent on the tcs of the market they are traded being traded on."
aluckyaday,i think that depends on your size and whether you can bully the others. if you are big enough you can be localist. not sure the eu is globalist they have just realised that to compete with the large localists usa and china you have to become bigger yourself!
aluckyaday,i could say allowing sharp punters to bet in the same market is unfair on the recreational punters. the recreational punters get what they want from the soft books. ease of use and a huge range of markets and offers. these would not be available in an unrestricted market.
aluckyaday,but can he react as quick as the bots? as soon as you go online you open yourself up to arbers and the like. that is a big reason why most european books have to limit accounts. just because he is old school won't stop the new school thieves!
aluckyaday,"i think american pros may find that as more books adopt a european model he will find it more and more difficult to make his plays that target public biases. the value will be there for recreational players but not for ""pros"" as books restrict rather than move lines."
aluckyaday,as for having an edge over pinnacles own models. in the event that you can beat their models and not just public biases marco blume has already said they  daily fantasy sports  stop until they fully understand where your edge comes from. guess that could be called reverse engineering
aluckyaday,assuming the price data is accurate the way i would do it would be to collect live data myself using the pinney api for matches with the same start time at consistent time before kickoff.  if i then saw a margin differential between matches i'd be convinced until then....
aluckyaday,in homage to      and a recent thread on data mining i've decided to do some myself. i've looked at how much profit my luckies make on each day of the month. the 15th of the month is the best it has returned a spectacular roi of 215 percent ....
theFirmAISports,heres with 1000 bets. 14.1 percent  chance of losing. i think we all understand the law of large numbers and the more bets you get down at a higher edge the better... but theres still a ton of randomness that can screw you over (even in the long run)
joeytunes2,i have to say i dont give enough credit to  was one of the first guys in the game to develop his own program and perfect it. he spent 15 years building it. maybe only one or two people in  the game were ahead of him. billy being one.
joeytunes2,"tell you right now. i understand where your coming from. we got bullied by  ohio st. lsu. if you wanna call the cam championship game bulled that would be another. i dont believe in 10 years ago data. i know

EdMillerPoker,"i think this is basically how humanity breaks down:

a small  percent  of people are wired to build push boundaries explore

a small  percent  of people are driven to try to lead the apparatuses of organization use of force and war

everyone else doesn't really want either of these"
EdMillerPoker,"ha no i always appreciate people who send me errors.

those guys usually go on to offer me a how-could-i-day-no deal of just give me a bankroll and a bunch of free lessons and ill give you a cut of whatever i win

glad you like the course :)"
EdMillerPoker,"in-play betting tip:

if a sportsbook always suspends in-play betting midway thru the 4th quarter its a tacit admission that their model produces garbage at the end of every game.

if its garbage at the end of the game tho then that means there are errors throughout the game."
EdMillerPoker,"daily fantasy sports  want to belabor the point but if i thought he was going to stick to pick selling i wouldn't be in this thread.

but he's said repeatedly he has no intention to do that and he's been pretty clear about what he does intend to do."
EdMillerPoker,imo  daily fantasy sports  stop with the breakfast sandwiches. stop eating meat at the other meals first and  daily fantasy sports  worry about breakfast for now. then the more you get used to it eventually you might try subbing something out for the bacon in the sandwich. or not.
EdMillerPoker,yes you have way more kidney tissue than you need which is why an nfl player can have a chronic progressive kidney disease like fsgs and not even know it. the percentage of intact tissue handles the load until it gets below a threshold and then kidney failure starts.
EdMillerPoker,there is a point where this behavior from operators bleeds into bad faith behavior on their part and that is the point where regulators should step in and make and enforce rules. there's a squishy middle in there and  it is  where operators can fairly compete with one another.
GolcondaFund,"a lot of pay check to pay check people are set to lose money savings jobs and thus struggle to cover their base needs.

nonrandomalpha,you going to a game and cheering for the team also accomplishes nothing. so should you not do it? ofc thats silly. he wants to burn the jersey to express frustration which helps release pent up tensions. thats the purpose thats the personal accomplishment for him. let him be
nonrandomalpha,taylor lewan arguably the titans' best offensive lineman is eligible to return this week after serving his 4 game suspension. he was reportedly one of the first ones in the building on monday am. this is a meaningful tailwind for henry + mariota that is flying under the radar
LeeSharpeNFL,"discovered an annoying bug that i introduced this year but only manifests itself between week 17 and the wildcard. these are revised values after that fix.

this puts me pretty close to the market overall except the market prefers sf to no. my model liking no more surprised me."
LeeSharpeNFL,"you have completion probability right? why not look at the max(catch probability of the nearest receiver to a given defender in coverage) at every frame across a play?

then you can track that across plays. good dbs will keep this value small. in theory. it may not be stable."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my model likes the bills today but i'm concerned about their defensive strength being vs. the pass and far less vs. the run.

against any team *other* than the ravens  that is  what you would want.... but perhaps not vs. the ravens (and my model isn't accounting for this)."
LeeSharpeNFL,"trubisky and mariota as likely options for bears 2020 starter is.... uninspiring to say the least but the bears  daily fantasy sports  have great options.

would prefer a foles trade over either i think.

but any of these options are at best a bridge not the long term answer."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""who decides which behaviors perpetuate these negative beliefs?""

obviously they are individuals who  daily fantasy sports  speak with one voice but people of color know a lot more than me a white person. so if they tell me i'm saying something that does that i listen apologize and change."
LeeSharpeNFL,"people have no interest in being polite. and my block button has no patience for them.

yesterday someone replied to me saying ""can't believe you put x above y this is why you're a sportswriter without a blue checkmark.""

(the joke is on them i am not a sportswriter.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"the ""double doink"" game depressed me i think more than most bears fans. i knew we were on an unsustainable high and a ""one season wonder"". 

losing a playoff game as 7 point favorites knowing your next season is likely gonna be mediocre is frustrating.

gl  enjoy the ride."
whale_capper,jeff sackmann shocked the world with a study that serving first in the deciding set offered no advantage based on the data so i think that would trickle down to other sets and especially tbs... as a bettor though it always feels better and live lines are usually shaded
whale_capper,he's 25 already t10 in the league in real plus-minus he's played  60 games now two seasons in a row you can build a team around him in a multitude of ways plus i like his attitude... if he gets in better physical shape he is an mvp-type player
AndyMSFW,at the moment almost all the game are non-conference.  there are a few leagues that have some scheduled early but for the most part conference play starts when the new year does.  once we get to january everything should be a conf. game until we start putting em brackets.
AndyMSFW,going to try to be a little more dog-content heavy going forward.  twitter analytics tell me that more of you like dogs than sports.  i would love the 1 percent  of you who  daily fantasy sports  like sports to say hi though; love to know what you're all about.

AndyMSFW,that said i touched base with all the guys that i know can steer me back on track.  did the podcast with  hit the dms with the  and  of the world.  even tried to contact  (left a msg). i think we have a game plan to fuck up detroit.
AndyMSFW,"rbc canadian open!
promised myself i'd bet the earlier numbers this week so here we are on a tuesday night!  it'll be interesting to see if anything moves like last week either way.  dustin johnson is the favorite so it seemed fitting to work in a picture of paulina:"
AndyMSFW,"great question! no.
i'm still running everything independently i actually though my volume would be higher since i'd be hedging left and right.  which leads me to:  the green bay play is not a hedge even though i have some wright state outright.  the model wanted to play them."
JoeyKnish22,this is a 3 way live goal line. i believe (would need to double check) wolves have to lose by one or win outright for you to cash. for example if the game finishes in a draw 1-1 you lose. where as my 2 way live line would win.
JoeyKnish22,"have baylor and hawaii futures from this thread. will share what im doing   hedge strategy with baylor tomorrow. 

hawaii is a hope/ pray not hedging anything pregame at the steep moneyline will look live if possible. frankly i didnt put enough on 50/1 to lay this boise moneyline pregame."
JoeyKnish22,"i cant believe im going to do this. after flaunting the haskins fade all last week. i said it was a cross off last night. i lied. not betting a lot will likely regret it. 

but.....lions should not be laying 3.5 with these injuries. i took some skins +3.5"
JoeyKnish22,i have gad (generalized anxiety disorder). earlier this year had a real rough bout of anxiety while traveling. felt like i was losing my mind so i sought help. got on some anti-anxiety meds and regularly therapy sessions. within a few weeks was feeling like my old self again.
JoeyKnish22,last season (for those shorter time followers) i used to try and hijack one game from his weekly threads and pick against him. dont think we had a game all season at open where we directly bet opposite sides until now. this is for all the offseason bragging rights!!!
JoeyKnish22,if you go across the big 4 euro leagues they are the only team in that price range that even remotely has a realistic chance to make a run at the league. i really like a couple of the moves theyve made this offseason regardless of greizmann likely leaving.
TheKostos,alex bregman is a fraud and clown and cheating scumbag. jose altuve is a fraud and clown and cheating scumbag. justin verlander wants to open his mouth about everything under the sun but is nowhere to be found. this is a team of liars cheaters and scumbags. fuck them
TheKostos,my laptop is a few months old and it can barely operate. and  it is  every single website these days you're right not just sports. they take like 30 seconds to fully load before you can scroll.  it is  like  it is  the late 90s again on dial up

LockyLockerson,"if you end up watching this tonight there's a part during kobe's insane shot-making in the 4th where the broadcast goes to break on a shot of snoop dogg celebrating in the crowd and  who is calling the game has a really understated ""for shizzle.""  i laugh every time."
DannyParkins,ill continue to maintain amidst all the noise about boylen which is of course valid the biggest problem for the bulls is their abysmal point guard play. it makes the product so tough to watch compared to the rest of the league which is so deep at the position.
DannyParkins,lol. i said watson shouldve been the number 1 pick. hes my favorite college player ever. mahomes won mvp. deshaun just threw for 437 with 5  touchdown s. trubisky has been awful. the players are driving the narrative. i thought mitch would take a leap so far he hasnt.
DannyParkins,yes did you understand it? originally a troll that has evolved into real life use by some of the worst people including the new zeland shooter. youd suggest just ignoring that context after the cubs and nbc released a statement to all media or should people learn about it?
DannyParkins,there's so many fact errors in just one tweet and obviously you're just a troll who isn't actually interested in an honest discussion of a complex issue but i'll start with my parents arent lawyers and theres clearly some evidence or a da wouldn't say a crime was committed.
DannyParkins,the draft is before the all star break and after the draft he doesnt have a pick attached. i dont know if/when hell sign but one big fa reliever doesnt solve the problems with a pen thats given up 17 runs in 17 innings. again what dont i understand?
DannyParkins,size of the fanbase? maybe slightly. but so many games are already on cable. its not like theyre hard to find. think of it like this: would you rather share a large pizza with nbc and other teams or would you rather have a whole medium pizza to yourself?
DannyParkins,i dont discount politics being an issue for ratings and said its a factor. as is cord cutting. also not sure what poll from 2016 youre referring to but you know he lost the popular vote right? so id love to see a stat on your 55 percent  claim.

logan_matthews9,"some thoughts on the zimmerman trade:

1) lafc was bringing back almost everybody so why break up the group?
2) they are so much better than everyone else that it probably doesn't matter

below chart is before the trade. lafc had the highest percentage of returning value in mls"
logan_matthews9,i had a job interview recently where i was asked about the next step in soccer analytics and i proposed what i believe is both an ambitious and achievable goal of creating a value-added statistic that can match what war did for baseball (and the like across other sports)
logan_matthews9,"starting with matchups:

poston 1.83 vs todd
grillo 2.00 vs palmer
perez 1.67 vs imahira
stuard 2.00 vs putname
simpson 2.04 vs reed
snedeker 1.80 vs noren

tried to avoid hitting people i might want in the outright/top x markets like last week. too much edge on simpson though"
logan_matthews9,by my count this event has had a consistently improving field the last three years and this is another great one. by the nature of its qualification its a very top heavy field - about 11 people with  5 percent  chance of winning but 19 with  2 percent .
logan_matthews9,dude your just trolling him about kemba. hes a great (not elite) player who might fit better than kyrie. celtics arent a contender today but they could with big strides from tatum/brown. sixers are fine too but are less fine if butler walks. neither is in a great spot
logan_matthews9,personally im pulling for capela. imo hes the best defender of the three and hes also the best at the cs biggest weaknesses for like the past decade - rebounding. hes 25 closer than vuc to the js. and his contract is way better than what vuc will get
PikachuBets,congrats. your private family life will really help out all of your customers when you make your next huge bumbling mistake. up next: whoops! we need to double check with our top 10 accounting firm why our records are 69.69 percent  off of what someone else has tracked privately

PikachuBets,no i am hypothesizing (with high confidence) that he is one of the largest fattest attention whores on gambling twitter. has been since day 1. its obvious bc no pro bettor interacts with his fanboys to the extent he does. how many periscopes are we at now and counting?

adamchernoff,holy smokes! big canadianflashback here. my grandma had a big desk full of craft supplies and paper. i remember calling her during the christmas and explaining how to record the show on the vcr then racing to her house after school to make whatever he did. special show here...
adamchernoff,devalues the importance of different odds we just take it and hope the offences blow the doors off the defence. i hope this helps some folks put a number on their bet and think about how leads or deficits often provide an advantage or disadvantage when betting nfl totals.
adamchernoff,in nfl you often get hemmed in by keys too due to the fixed scoring. in many cases if you try to move too much to get balance you create the opportunity for a bigger liability coming back the other way than you had before the move all together.
adamchernoff,"example from the simple handicap football workbook for upcoming buf at nyg using the data sources included with  the workbook. 

i will have to figure out how to do better videos soon but i will continue to post these today and tomorrow as more copies of the book arrive."
adamchernoff,"confidence ratings allow for an up-sell opportunity but are also the easiest way to explain an edge without ever having one (more in a second) and public percentages - which are the worst piece of info online - make bettors feel great and allow sellers to push ""inside"" info."
adamchernoff,it is a good stat find but i feel with almost all turnover stats there are other big driving factors that make up for the difference which makes me question the correlation. just in this example alone each team but oakland had a dramatic roster change the improvement year.
adamchernoff,"uruguay -400 / 1.25 (0.80)
draw +500 / 6.00 (0.166)
japan +1400 / 15.00 (0.066)

to find probabilities just do 1/decimal odds.

using the same formula above lets calculate expected value of a $100 bet on japan. 

0.066 * $1400 - 0.966 * $100 = -$4.20 or -4.20 percent"
adamchernoff,trust me despite the dozens of x sportsbook lost the most money ever on tiger winning no sportsbook is upset about their customers having accounts at record highs. by the time its all given back by players in 2 weeks the return on promotion is massive. handle trumps revenue.
Ccon8181,bro i was like  what the fuck !!! how does this guy have a job. he marked him for a 3 yard gain after being tackled at line of scrimmage... the head ref with the emphatic 1st down signal on that 4th down stop is still all time though.
Ccon8181,im still in shock how the #raptors blew that last night.. siakum was forcing shots and missing all night... van fleet missed a bunch of looks and quinn cook lead gsw?! kawhi with 5 turnovers and mia shooting minus going to the free throw line. damn that was brutal!!

ToddFuhrman,sequence of plays that caused it to go over yes but not as bad by the box score with such a low total and a few  field goal 's kicked inside the 10; result truly could have been a coin flip but as an under better you deserved better

- losers pay out winners profit in actual money"
12Xpert,well  let us  see if they manage to mean regress. if not it might be time to rethink some of the xg modelling. after all for betting purposes xg is just an arms race. one model will overtake another and then get overtaken by another and on and on.
12Xpert,"i  daily fantasy sports  spit on people who have proved themselves to be capable of delivering persistent +ev. almost all people who call themselves ""tipsters"" aren't able to do that so i reserve the right to show people this reality. if you have a problem with that too bad."
12Xpert,i see. the bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. in this example i suppose binomial says m1 and m2 have about the same likelihood. priors are therefore important and bayes weakness is where they are hard to define.
12Xpert,"regarding first question i've not actually tested it.
regarding second question yes if it is real it is small.
regarding third question yes  it is  possible. bookmakers account for punter stupidity all the time. e.g. punters bet 60 to 40 on overs but prices  daily fantasy sports  reflect that."
12Xpert,"a useful read on the psychology and quantification of losing runs. however i think they've got their maths slightly wrong. 

""a service with a 49 percent  strike-rate has a 50/50 chance of hitting 10 losers on the bounce over a 650 bet period.""

i think it should be 850."
12Xpert,"daily fantasy sports  stop there jeff.  let us  look at the tens of millions at risk of diabetes stroke and heart failure egged on by crap food advertising.

if you'd like to join in with my threads about moral prohibition and the evolutionary motivations behind gambling then please follow."
12Xpert,well never know how much was down to greed and how much was simply regression to the mean. as for tipsters and punters its so hard to know whether you never really had what it takes once you lost it or whether the market just caught up with you.
12Xpert,"here we go again. the words 'monopoly' and ""footballdataco' (please that is not me) seem to go hand in hand. in 2004 the ecj ruled against them copyrighting fixture lists. this will end up back there. i suspect they are quite keen for boris to get brexit done beforehand."
12Xpert,but no one really knows how people and businesses will respond to wto rules.  it is  completely untested for such a major economy. i might be they respond positively to the decrease in uncertainty over the nature of brexit. once we know what we're dealing with people move on.
12Xpert,yes if we're not simply talking about the lucky ones they exist but in my view fewer than 1 percent  (possibly far fewer than that). is ssss you are reading? if so get to the end and then see if you have anything else you want to ask me.
12Xpert,in your opinion. and there is always a next time. if you  daily fantasy sports  suffer consequences you learn nothing.  that is  why there'll be another major financial crash because bankers weren't punished at least not in the uk. capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses (taleb).
12Xpert,main take is  daily fantasy sports  follow systems that are only based on trawling large volumes of data applying arbitrary criteria until you find something that would have made a profit. people are easily fooled into thinking their criteria can't be arbitrary. profits  daily fantasy sports  justify the criteria
12Xpert,i've debunked your value. you've been offered the opportunity to explain why i'm wrong why you're not just charting and data mining and back testing data to find patterns. you haven't bothered. i might be wrong but you won't say why. you won't offer the theory and test it.
12Xpert,as this is precisely the problem. you need to have an a priori reasons for expecting something to happen then test the data to see if that thing actually happens the way you said it would. technical analysis and charting doesn't do that  that is  why  it is  flawed.

mschwimer,1/2 big news! jambos set up an escrow account with capital one. they will independently verify that we have enough funds to cover our total liability updated weekly as our liabilities change and we will post a bank letter from capital one to our website under the faqs section.
mschwimer,i hope you guys are ready. im about to step this whole game up. got our general counsel to come in hot on twitter tomorrow to answer all legal questions!  unlike me he has tons of experience in the space. previously was gc at mgm. this will be fun.
mschwimer,i love it. if anyone should be skeptical its the gambling twitter world. im right with them. skepticism is great!  but when iv answered every single question and proved beyond any doubt we are legit then what? unless im missing something. is there an issue i have not answered?
RufusPeabody,would love feedback from those of you interested in this! for this to work we'll need a lot of people to donate their time. do you have technical expertise (i.e. helping build a website) you could volunteer? is there anything i missed? what do you think is important?
RufusPeabody,utah is the  #5 team using only current season play but with a pac12 schedule  nonconf schedule of byu n ill and idaho st hard to imagine them leapfrogging bama. how much will committee value p5 conf championship? we are bearish giving 1-loss utah a 22 percent  chance.
RufusPeabody,furthermore it makes it difficult to evaluate a tout's predictions. do their picks actually do better with bigger edges? and to gauge that properly (since there can be noise in small samples) you need to know their purported edges on games they didn't release plays on as well.
RufusPeabody,having worked by myself for so long the idea of working with a group of talented analysts was exciting. i really liked a lot of the guys who worked there. working with their brilliant head of analytics (who left shortly after) was a huge draw to me. (2/x)
RufusPeabody,of course there are. but also know that my dms are flooded with messages from touts and guess what? they all claim to be the 1 percent  that are an exception to the rule. for your average bettor trying to find those true exceptions is a fools errand.
RufusPeabody,interesting leaderboard: kang (mkt price ~100/1 pre-event) with 4-shot lead. still 36 holes to play but only 2 players who i priced better than 95/1 within 8 strokes of the lead -- and 2 closest chasers (duncan/every) were  400/1 pre-tourney. 70 percent  chance either kang or koepka win
RufusPeabody,if a tout's picks lose long-term they're still paid. even if they refund subscription fees they're free rolling  the customer loses. if a customer can't get down at the release price it doesn't directly hurt the tout. the seller's record is based on the price they sent out.
SportsCheetah,interesting there's probably going to be very nice ou to make the playoff price around this week in that case. chances of all 4 winning according to the current market is ~39 percent  and then there is the ~33 percent  of the time oregon just beats utah anyway.
SportsCheetah,"she bet falcons -3.5 too. i'm not tracking anything from her but would have said she definitely has picked more faves than dogs over the season. she also has been touting dallas +6.5 all week so ""square"" dog that prob is beating close  for what  it is  worth"
SportsCheetah,happy to go h2h in a contest with you for any amount of your choosing. im sure we can find a third party we both know or we can use a book in vegas to hold funds. let me know hoops or football whatever you want to do.
SportsCheetah,phi o54 -110 - sixers -160 to win division (big) o54 +1000 to win it all etc. all in my portfolio. supposed to lose jimmy and turned him into horford + richardson. thybulle most impactful rookie/6th man/dpoy dark horse. joel lost 25 lbs. simmons made a preseason 3.
SportsCheetah,min o35.5 -102 - prob my least favorite decision yet. is okogie/wiggins/culver/bates-diop/covington a viable lineup? we may find out. they have a lot of the same guy + teague + kat. best drtg in nba last season when cov was healthy. maybe culver was the missing piece? \_()_/
capjack2000,"age for  daily fantasy sports  play is 18. the  daily fantasy sports  companies *still* claim that wagering money on players' performance is not gambling. 

convenient stance when it enables exclusive access to the 18-20 demographic. might as well level the playing field for all sports wagering operators. #18forall"
capjack2000,"i'm not being paid or compensated to write any of this. i just like to highlight good things. 

you can use it to spot arbs (there's always some) or just value shop.  it is  pretty comprehensive. 

the site uses affiliate links to monetize their hard work. 

other states..."
capjack2000,"i could probably easily write a book on the tax/business implications of being a pro gambler.

for instance i'm able to contribute over 25 percent  of my gross income to my solo401k plan. this reduces taxable income. here's a blog post i wrote about it 2  years ago:"
capjack2000,if you exceed a $5k win that is at 300:1 odds or greater the book can take withholding that youd get back at tax time assuming you werent a winner on the year. if you have any cash transaction $10k you have to provide id for a ctr.
capjack2000,"one of the biggest myths that people believe is that there is a law in nv that says you must have id on you at all times in a casino. 

100 out of 100 security guards believe  it is  true.  

ask them to cite that law...it doesn't exist."
capjack2000,"they've changed it from bonus money to a free bet where your stake gets subtracted from a winning wager. it essentially cuts the positive expected value of this promotion in half...halfway through the season-long promotion. 

the dge would probably say they have the right to change the terms...but..."
capjack2000,"only if they exceed the $600 win and 300:1 threshold laid out by the irs. so if someone hits an insane parlay or a jackpot parlay card or something like that. 

i'm not aware of any other state that applies a withholding to normal wagers of any amount."
capjack2000,"non-us citizens or those without an itin proving they are from a country with a tax treaty with the us do get federal withholding. however in this case it is an or state regulation and applies to everyone. 

hopefully they are beginning to see how misguided it is."
capjack2000,"15-20  years ago when i was first starting out in sports betting i used to read stanford wong's forum sharpsportsbetting. i even bought picks from there.  

anyway one year there was a tout yosh who was slowly losing over the season. as the season was winding down he..."
capjack2000,ok the daily wager on espn was....decent imo. so far above and beyond lock it in that there's no comparison. i wish it was a little less pick-centric. early segments felt too busy. later segments had better pace and analysis. plenty of room for improvement but decent start.
dinkinc,smackdown review..... vince hates work-rate... always push celebs and big guys... he does let is undercard workers be lumberjacks so they get a better payday.. great job by becky bailing out the rock when he forgot his lines.  poor kofi back to comedy status . solid ladder match
robpizzola,i shared this with  in 2015 and can now think of many more disagreements i have with the flow chart. i wont share his responses bc they were shared in confidence but they were level-headed fair rebuttals. regardless i dont think things are as clear cut as this.
VegasRefund,i went to the 2006 nfl draft and it was one of my most memorable sports experiences to date. highly recommend for any avid fan its a borderline bucket list type of event (and very affordable). just going once is enough sequel wouldnt live up to the hype.
VegasRefund,jalen hurts is a confirmed good dude.. im genuinely happy for him and the opportunity this potentially presents him. he might not have the arm talent of the qbs before him.. but if anyone can offset that with everything else he brings to the table its lincoln riley.
suuma810,"ich habe brigens auch nie behauptet dass dies ab sofort die neue zahl ist um blocker und rusher zu bewerten. aber ich finde es hochinteressant und es ist ein schritt in die richtige richtung.

ClevTA,7-2 in bowl picks on the action app. on iowa st oklahoma and over osu/clemson. feel like im on an island but i think the shock of both teams having to face the athletes  skill on offense will lead to lots of points early at least. bucks 36-33
ClevTA,"i sent zac my projected spreads a few games ago and hit buff pitt  miami on the nail so heres what i project the rest of the season:
browns +3.5 at pit
browns -9.5 vs cinci
browns pk at az
browns +3.5 v baltimore 
browns -4.5 at cinci"
ClevTA,browns opponents so far are combined 36-17. their remaining opponents record is 21-45-1. theyve played the two best 3 of the top 7 and 5 of the top 11 dvoa tms. crazy hard. what if the browns schedule was flipped and they started with the back half first?
ClevTA,i think he when he says fade everybody he means fade all public sides. if all u did was blindly fade the public u would prob end up right around 50 percent  which is fine since u will never get killed but u will never actually win either
CizzlingSports,".addendum - this is only the record of plays  sells to his $99/year subscribers on sun nights.

this is not a record of any tv playz periscope playz podcast plays etc. because  that is  dumb and also i'm sure his subs love he's releasing other plays randomly smh"
spanky,"keeping it real is important to me.  

i've learned so much over the last 20 years both by making mistakes and listening to others who have paved the way.  

giving back to the sports betting community has become more fulfilling than i thought.

thanks for the kind words"
spanky,"once you accept that your opinion is  garbage you can then focus on beating slow outs.

i admittedly know nothing about players teams etc.. i barely understand the rules.

attack the bookies when theyre weak.  laying -110 gives you the right to choose what and when to bet."
spanky,this hits the nail on the head. call me old school but that shit wouldnt fly had paul oneil been on that team.  lose with dignity. walk off the field with your head hung. dont stand there like a jackass smiling in front of your teammates and fans.
spanky,"if you treat your bookmaker like a gentleman then your bookmaker will reciprocate. the bookie-bettor relationship does not need to adversarial.  i make it a point to be very friendly with many of my bookmakers.

however if i get kicked out and beard back in i become merciless."
spanky,i 100 percent  believe she is tossed. shell readily admit shes not the sharpest of the sharp but getting tossed from  doesnt require you to be extremely sharp. i just cant believe they wouldnt bite the bullet for her given she has a big voice on social media.
spanky,"thanks to everyone that came out yesterday   

 never ceases to amaze me how much he knows about the business. 

i hope you all enjoyed a taste of a behind the scenes view of how we earn.  betting sports professionally aint easy but i love every minutes of it"
spanky,pay attention us bookmakers.  a guaranteed limit sheet is a basic necessity. you go into  and ask for a limit sheet they tell you there are no limits or it all depends. thats bs. a bookmaker can always offer the customer more but should guarantee the house limit!
spanky,"""the idea that there are people so bad at betting that fading them  betting the opposite of what theyre on  provides value is preposterous""  providing value vs making money is where i misunderstood you.  is it bad luck or extreme lack of skill. bm chart would help solve"
spanky,agreed for one sole instance. over the course of time the power of reverse engineering is beyond your wildest dreams. you consciously try not to say much but your subconscious may inadvertently take over. there's many things to talk about. golf shouldn't be one of them. jmo pal
spanky,i appreciate the kind words but this is an entertainment show. rufus and i are not entertainers. we are professional sports bettors with nothing to sell. watching me work would probably put people to sleep.  would be fun to watch after you put a few drinks in him
spanky,thanks for the kind words. better to ask a bookmaker as im just a bettor. for very high profile games like the sb equal action is desired. for the other 99 percent  of games bookmakers strive to be sharp side heavy. usually if sharps win then bookmakers win.
spanky,has been booking my action for about ten days.  im very pleased with the experience... they have very sharp people behind the scenes and the management has been a pleasure to deal with. theyre not afraid to book a bet... one of the best in nj. highly recommend!
spanky,every interaction i have every book i read etc.. there are gems. some are more challenging to find than others but the quest for knowledge should never stop. dont be quick to discredit someone fully based on one or even several poor qualities especially if they are successful
spanky,sorry twitter land for ranting and raving... being banned from all these joints is very frustrating.  i worked so damn hard to get to the level im at and instead of being given a pat on the back im given a kick in the ass.  it really sucks.
spanky,99.9  percent  of bookmakers out there.. i guess were gonna have to start moving on action with donbest being down. what does moving on action mean? it means we adjust our numbers on bets we book instead of bets that other bookmakers book. that sounds like hard work!
spanky,to anyone out there that voted do the world a favor and please dont complain if the results dont go your way.  hearing people bitch about politics is nauseating.  go live your life. if you believe politicians really care about you i have a bridge to sell you.
spanky,hope my video did its part to shed light to the gambling population. glad  wrote the article on how winners are treated.  hopefully someone can find a solution to benefit everyone involved.  ill be tweeting a lot less as the busy season is upon us. good luck everyone
PlusEVAnalytics,"im interested in a professional conversation. you and i have already had one. i promise to keep it open minded and respectful.
topics:
1 explain the tease through zero
2 bankroll requirements 
3 high volume of bets how to square that with market efficiency
4 anything u want?"
PlusEVAnalytics,au contraire my friend its much more than semantics. its everything. welcome to the world of parameter uncertainty! imagine youre evaluating a game and you only know half the rules. one observation can help a lot! same game same rules in game 2 but you have more knowledge.
PlusEVAnalytics,possibly - cant say for sure because i dont know how you are defining momentum factor. to me its less about momentum and more about unquantifiable factors (how much sleep each player got the night before their state of mind etc) that manifest in point to point correlation.
PlusEVAnalytics,"probability that player wins a given point = a/(a+b) where a and b are each players power rating. are a and b:
- constant throughout the match?
- decaying as the match progresses according to each players stamina?
- posteriors that update as fn of points previously played?"
PlusEVAnalytics,what i could never solve was this...youd think that everyone would just try to get to the finish line in the shortest possible time but there are some in-race strategic elements involved probably because of the constraint that one horse can occupy any given space at given time
PlusEVAnalytics,any adjustments to kelly for epistemic uncertainty are ad-hoc (bet half k because im not sure how accurate my edges are) but there is a better way using bayesian posterior distributions to find the optimal k fraction you should use. any interest in an article on this subject?
aluckyaday,"i know that but the recreational betting public  daily fantasy sports . ""winning"" (or what i like to term recreational sharp) punters are using the term to get recreational punters on their side for something that if were changed would be detrimental to recreational punters. i dislike that."
aluckyaday,that is not how modern bookmaking works. they make more money booking only recreationals. why run a model that is less profitable? its not that they are not talented. it is just that talent is no longer needed. add it to the list of professions tech has changed.
aluckyaday,maybe a large information asymmetry investors on one side and whoever was selling moneyline as the answer to everything on the other. i doubt they were the first and won't be the last to fall for the lure of moneyline is the answer now what is the question?
aluckyaday,much better but if you want to attract investment you need to add more features. anything that can be visualized tends not to pass the bullshit test. adding cheese consumption per capita and deaths by bed sheet tanglisation in the managers own country should improve things no deal
aluckyaday,that would be my thoughts too. just be interesting to show if the simulation bares this out. although i would think the bookies would have lower than fair win odds in the non mvg half to compensate for the value given on the place part of the bet.
aluckyaday,do you know the process that discovered the mistake? if it were done at settlement then surely all other correlated parlays would be detected there too. i guess the issue for bm is no one would turn up to collect on losing tickets. online refunds should be automatic.
aluckyaday,i doubt that is going to happen as there is not majority in parliament for it and they are sovereign after all . doubt the  eu will make a decision based on a short lived executive. extension for referendum or general election (whichever parliament decides) will be granted.
aluckyaday,they  daily fantasy sports  win in financial terms but that is not what they are buying. recreational betting is a totally different product and market. they are buying dopamine which enhances the enjoyment of watching a game. its entertainment just like going to the cinema or bowling alley.
aluckyaday,why do uk politicians find it so hard to understand that #brexit as promised is impossible. there is a paradox. you can have any 2 but not all three of leave the customs union/single market no uk/irish border maintain the union. imho anyone who says otherwise is lying.
aluckyaday,not simple though. basically the leave message is britain is great we  daily fantasy sports  need others. whereas remains message is britain needs to be part of europe to prosper. whatever the evidence the second option is unlikely to change the mind of those who believe the first!
aluckyaday,exactly that is why there is not much point in having referendums in the uk. what you are asking for is a fundamental change in how democracy has been implemented in the uk for hundreds of years. lets have a referendum to see if it can be changed
aluckyaday,yes. i think there have been a few stories around manipulating cashout. they are worth watching as you can sometimes cash out for your stake and rebet with a different book where the price has drifted or cashout for a profit and rebet elsewhere at a bigger price.
aluckyaday,why would they bother betting on an exchange at all if there is no square money to be won? it will be interesting to see how  gets on trying to get squares to bet on an exchange. some people are going to get very rich if he succeeds.
aluckyaday,the market cap comes from the sports books of paddy power and betfair plus dk in the us not the exchange. i monitor the betfair exchange every day (horse racing) and the early liquidity has declined significantly over the last 5 years. have you read the whole article?
aluckyaday,maybe the reason why we have not discovered intelligent life elsewhere when a life form has the technology to contact others they also have the tech to destroy themselves! ask the actuary what is the chance of 2 independent life forms surviving long enough to contact each other?
aluckyaday,sorry for the delay my notifications have been messed up! poor for who? not for the books. its a well tested formula in europe. not poor for recreational punters either who a betting for a dopamine hit rather than to make money. its only poor for +ev punters
aluckyaday,i know they do that for the running order but what about the order they announce the votes. betfair remains open during this period (seems a bit weird to me as some people know the results then again some will know the jury votes after the rehearsal anyway!).
aluckyaday,getting very short would be shocked if you could not trade out for a profit at some point. do you know if the order the votes are announced is fixed? past few years i've got the impression there has been manipulation of the order to make it exciting.
theFirmAISports,haha i knew i was forgetting the retrograde effect! but yeah nfl is all small sample size and i never claimed our models were perfect. for this model keeping the day in lowered the error slightly in backtesting and cross validation but i know that != future scores.
theFirmAISports,"college football  games - picks with probability of success:

your gonna crack all the algorithms  
spend more time in the gym and less worrying how much better my life is"
joeyisaks,lauren sorry to break the news but you work for a company that is basically just as big a scam as dave / both give nonsensical advice with no chance to win and charge / and yes i get it you guys charge minimal will be your reply
EdMillerPoker,seems like survival bias. one poss mechanism: a person who makes it to 65 with 2 risk alleles and no ckd has probably avoided certain second hit infections that may perhaps increase a lifetime cancer risk or otherwise weaken the bodys ability to handle illness in later life
EdMillerPoker,yes in many ways its similar to the poker books in terms of readability and audience. main difference is in poker you then go play $1-$2 and hopefully win. theres no $1-$2 in sports betting its more like you have to start out playing against the $10-$20 players.
EdMillerPoker,and it seems clear to me that a single company of the scale of amazon could feasibly meet the entire worldwide demand for sports gambling entertainment. theres really no room for hedge funds or the like which are really a pimple on the ass of global economic activity
EdMillerPoker,at some point you need war economic collapse etc to happen in other countries so that buying your paper continues to look good compared to alternatives. i have no idea what the time horizon is for this but i would assume the bernies should be concerned about this

nonrandomalpha,i never go hog wild or buy all at once no matter the situation. given such a steep and swift drawdown ill be nibbling end of week into friday close. not trying to call a bottom but were closer than we were at the beginning of the week.
nonrandomalpha,thats why using units in general is asinine. pls help change this culture. all bets should be expressed as  percent  of bankroll. do you think portfolio managers keep track of win/loss record on stock trades? ofc not. its about winning big when right and losing small when wrong.
nonrandomalpha,we can agree that uf needs to have higher standards for athletes. however im confident if ucf had the ability to recruit 5 star nfl caliber murderers then it would. the moral choice is not a hard one for ucf because it doesnt have opportunities to make them.
nonrandomalpha,too early to make these kinds of declarative statements. preseason is bizarro world that is inclined to deceive. i remember as a kid matt flynn putting up hall of fame caliber preseason performances creating a lot of buzz. of course he flamed out after getting a starting gig.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i did s(ydstogo)  s(yardline_100) and binned wp (0.2 0.8 middle).

gonna add those two along with another price i like...

streelman t20 +150
taylor t20  +275

AndyMSFW,"#fifawwc update!
went 7-4 with a half win through the group stage for +1.99x.  
all 4 futures are alive and cannot meet before the semis
group winner parlay hit at +154
kerr is tied for most goals 
no one took their shirt off yet

on to the knockouts!"
AndyMSFW,yeah  it is  a bit vague.  not sure if she's referring to the fact that nba players take a bigger percentage of revenue or if she's taking a shot at the wnba and owners.  either way they need stronger union leadership and some way to find some leverage.
JoeyKnish22,youre looking at it too narrowly/selfishly. reduced juiced doesnt sell. books arent gonna reduce profitability just to do it. a $25 free bet would get more ppl in the door than -105 lines. until that changes on a massive scale theres no incentive for it to become standard
JoeyKnish22,lost more money on horse racing this year than any other sport including the most excruciating beat of my life on the kentucky derby. now ive got picks for every race. thanks bear ill dm my address so you can send some canned goods if it goes poorly.
TheKostos,not sure if i'll take leipzig but i'm definitely not betting spurs. no kane/son. like the under if anything have to imagine mou will play conservative. have feeling this is nagelsmann's moment to shine and rbl wins the overall tie. just not sure of an outright win today.
LockyLockerson,"oh it could totally be a thing.  again the spreadsheet is a tool not a set of orders.  a ton of things aren't going to be baked in but  it is  sort of a baseline to work off of then ask ""why is the number moving that way?"""
LockyLockerson,also if a player isn't headed in that direction (with the exception of nash and there are very obvious reasons why that was different) he isn't just going to start heading in that direction quickly at like age 28.  nba players start really peaking at like year 5-ish.
LockyLockerson,"south carolina has alabama on deck and is breaking in a new qb.  they won by a billion.

this is where you say ""well no but they wanted hilinski to get his confidence!""

to which i respond ""so which narratives override the lookahead? is there a chart somewhere?"""
LockyLockerson,"a new venture begins tonight!

i'll be co-hosting #youbetteryoubet 6p-10p et with  you can watch on  with the rdc app. after the show ends it becomes a podcast on demand for you. 

this is where i will be doing almost all my  college football /nfl talk this season."
LockyLockerson,basically road teams started winning more and more and more the last 4 years.  i have no idea why this would happen but i just think  it is  interesting.  just as a random aside hfa seems to be worth 1.5 points-ish if you take all 10 years together.
LockyLockerson,good news is theyll have the benefit of fewer tough games because of conference and their stat profile has a chance to get crazy inflated because of competition which means overvalued. bad news is their seed usually maxes out lower than big teams. a fun story to follow.
EliHershkovich,"you jumped in when  it is  interspersed throughout this nd lovefest.

buckeyes lose an elite dc in grinch (stated above) while already suceptible to explosive rushing plays. expecting an adjustment period for fields too. not sure why  it is  all rainbows for ryan day in year no. 1."
DannyParkins,i just dont do press conference rage like so many seem to love in football. they all lie. good coaches and gms from winning organizations. bad coaches and gms from losing ones. what they say doesnt matter. its a salary capped sport with deadlines. judge the bears actions.
DannyParkins,obama used to say dont let great be the enemy of good. this seems to be an extension of that idea when it comes to our current discourse especially online. he doesnt excuse bad behavior or say you can never be called out but its pretty practical imo.
DannyParkins,because the vast majority of the time the ratings on this station like any local sports station or frankly station in general are going to be minimal so what you can charge for advertising is minimal. the money comes from the subscription fees monthly being bundled with cable.
chadmillman,"welp that didn't take long. 

congrats to everyone in nj who took advantage of our no-brainer promo to win $100 with mgm: will lamar jackson gain six yards rushing (more yards than there were seasons of the wire)? 

more to come tomorrow and again for cfp title game."
Gingfacekillah,i think the fo saw what many fans also noticed: drummond's stat production is impressive but necessitates a certain style of play the league is moving away from and entails a high degree of possession churning. det was paying a high opportunity cost to get those pts/rebs/ast #'s
Gingfacekillah,"nba tip: avoid teams out of the playoff picture post all-star break. two competing factors are going to throw your predictions off:
1) teams tanking by restricting player minutes and
2) the league evening out wins so that even worst teams get ~20 wins. 

look at previous years:"
Gingfacekillah,"can i ask your opinion on a modelling question? do you think an nba model that doesn't forecast at the player level is unusable? injuries and individual scoring seem to have largest impact in the nba (not to mention the ""musical chairs"" action at the trade deadline). thoughts?"
Gingfacekillah,its true. ive had a number of meetings with phds in stats at the local university. even ones that have done research on uefa modeling etc. they dont care much for the profit potential. they model something say isnt that interesting and then go on to something else.
logan_matthews9,1) they acknowledge that customers are having trouble getting the odds posted but they just throw up a warning and continue selling. in the faq at one point it said specifically if you cant get the lines they offer dont buy the service. weird that wasnt mentioned here...
logan_matthews9,"being in jax that is almost assuredly true

tre herdon got exposed last week but denver didnt attack him enough. i expect carolina will. in the past good rbs were contained by telvin smith whos no longer playing. falls on leon jacobs/quincy williams who arent at that level"
logan_matthews9,if the market ends inefficiently then yes closing line value is not important. i think theres certainly value but yes the last line isnt necessarily the best indicator. i would recommend tracking it however as it would be another indicator of a good model over the long term
logan_matthews9,i know you base it off league averages but those daily changes are almost insignificant this deep into the season. and unless a team is on a back to back their numbers wont change at all (and b2b teams wont have lines posted before their first game anyways)
PikachuBets,do you really not get it? its really not difficult. the guy who made this must be a drop dead fucking lifetime loser who is rich. like he definitely bets huge amounts and just torches money. if you consistently win they wont even book 500 let alone 150k
PikachuBets,"lol  what the fuck . 2 scenarios:

1. playing dumb. financial ""typos"" were trying to freeroll to see if anyone would notice. if not use tos to screw them

2. company so fucking inept they can't get incredibly important financial numbers correct

both conclusions? avoid like the plague"
PikachuBets,ras doesnt give a shit about his tout service lol. its pennies for his revenue and profit. he only maintains it for like 5 percent  of his volume if even that. cant believe how much time you spend writing this horseshit you sincerely believe to be fact. lol
PikachuBets,define your temporal boundaries for wins. lifetime wins? nobody here is talking about lifetime wins. spanky is talking about short-term w/l. those come and go. in the long term everyone with a ++ record has to have made +ev bets which in turn means they have captured +clv.
PikachuBets,"b4 someone's triggered by my saying he's clueless (""but he's winning!"") let me point out that this is a guy who is ""very hesitant"" to bet  college basketball  until february but he thinks he can be convinced that maybe there is value in dec/jan. what a fucking joke"

adamchernoff,"i didn't get the memo and took my podcast ""bye week"" last monday. this seemed to be the one though. three of the shows i listen and watch have skipped their usual monday/tuesday episode or had replacement hosts. how will we know what to think about week 12?"
adamchernoff,well said. i think a lot of the handicapping stops at the qb for most which makes 17 all the way down to 14 quite reasonable. but as you mentioned a lot more going on with the game than that. mia potentially without their entire starting secondary too.

adamchernoff,mauro icardi not being named to the squad is insanity. backline is a huge worry. sampaoli struggled to break down iceland/nigeria in 2018 now scaloni will face three equally compact/physical defences in the group stage. for me this team is a complete coin flip. 9/2 is too short.
adamchernoff,"the simple handicap open forum - #006

im glad us laws are loosening but these products are a joke."
adamchernoff,full take on the full episode. long story short the path to both teams offensive success and best matchup monday is to run. if the different practice week/altitude/press requirement slow the game at all - which it does in other sports 63.5 becomes high to keep pace with.
Ccon8181,wow that rarely ever thrown flag against the #saints at the end of the half kept the over from hitting 1st half and the game on pace for the over. live over under now 43 below open of 44.5 that was then bet up to 49  #indvsno #mnfxespn
Ccon8181,i know hes shot well especially verse garbage teams like boston college wake ect. but anyone can see hes a liability verse any sort of talent. even in a zone they cant hide it. shooters just rise up in his face. plus huge downgrade from howard and battle.
Ccon8181,hard to decide who i want to lose this # thursday night football  game. the #browns have burned me way too often over the last 2 years. while the #jets (geno smith) are responsible for my all time worst bad best. glad to have sat this out #clevsnyj
ToddFuhrman,won't speak for payne here but it was the wrong side.  tampa had a few chances to make plays but unfortunately didn't.  biggest play of the game came down 7 and couldn't get off the field on 3rd and 10; led to backbreaking 91 yard saints death march
ToddFuhrman,ha we joke about it all the time but  core mission from day 1 was to make better bettors rather than just try and pick games on the podcast so hopefully you've learned something from us over the years (and developed a new found love for lara bars)
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to betting sports one of the best analogies i ever heard was  it is  a lot like old school baseball playing station to station; stringing together singles is essential to rallies whereas swinging for the fences every day only leads to strikeouts and bankroll erosion
ToddFuhrman,as they should be and the donald sterlings of the world have no place. i definitely hear your points i guess my frustration is if you want to lead change and its def needed is this where we should be fighting the battle? feel efforts better focused elsewhere
ToddFuhrman,it aint that simple because top guys are going to get paid off the books. lets not kid ourselves acting like the top d-1 athletes arent getting paid handsomely already is just naievete.  yet to see someone propose a pay for play model that works for ncaa sports
12Xpert,no i dont. gambling is a product like alcohol holidays and ice cream. all cause harm. all also provide much pleasure to many people. people pick and choose their moral battles almost all of it is virtue signalling because they can so easily be shown to be hypocrites.
12Xpert,brexit seems better to some marxism to others. but  let us  be clear. brexit won't stop immigration. it won't even change the levels.  that is  all bullshit. but social engineering and wealth redistribution can't be paid for by the top 5 percent .  that is  all bullshit too.
12Xpert,i'm not so much questioning the accuracy of the predictions rather the conspiracist nonsense that the world is run by tories/jews/free masons. i get really sick of listening to people bleat it. sadly  it is  infected the corbyn labour party and  that is  why he's being called out.
12Xpert,besides some bookmakers already do run two different markets. one time i was told by one particularly irrelevant soft brand that i wan't allowed an advertised price but they would give me a shorter one which was shorter than the new price they shortened the original one to.
12Xpert,it is  just never going to happen in a domestic league. barcelona were 4.58 v celta. they'd just won la liga and were about to play liverpool so meaningless and they lost. real madrid were 3.69 away against barca they lost. juve 3.14 away v napoli. they won.
12Xpert,and since then the surface temperatures have been increasing now about 1 degree celsius above global average pre-industrial value. doesn't sound much but to give some perspective the earth was only about 5c cooler as an average in the last ice age northern uk was under 2km ice
12Xpert,while tipsters like you exist punters will never learn anything. maybe you're right their too lazy to bother. but  daily fantasy sports  pretend you're somehow holier than thou because i'm affiliate scum and you offer winners. nearly all of your like are f....g useless and are tossing coins.
12Xpert,but difference with wocs and maxi's draws stuff as i understand his systems to be is that wocs was developed with a priori thinking (pinnacle prices are wise) which could then be tested with data. trawling data until you find combinations of things that are profitable is not.

mschwimer,now that is simply not true. roughly 1000 and been going at it for more than 6 months. literally not a single word from any of them that this was an issue. and we had  on it. if anyone would have an issue it would be him haha.
mschwimer,this has nothing to do with being on either side of the bet. i had no action at all on either side. its about doing the right thing vs. doing the easy thing. vegas books do it the easy way. nj books do it the right way imo
mschwimer,"correct for vegas books. nj books are different. fanduel graded the over and the cardinals as winners. it is in their rules. google fanduel baseball betting rules and you will see. 

really needs to be an industry standard on this and fanduel is by far the most logical."
mschwimer,this has been a fascinating discussion. i believe fanduels ruling is by far the most logical and makes the most sense. however it is clear that is not the industry standard. i will go with the middle of the road answer and just make both plays no action.

RufusPeabody,"not blogging  nfl plays this year. why?  it is  one input to my betting but not the only one. it doesn't feel right to give out a ""model play"" on for example the bengals while i'm not betting it myself because of my other inputs (player-level stuff)."
RufusPeabody,from what i saw in a small subset of their picks they were not getting much of any closing line value relative to market price at release (despite a profitable run in  college basketball  at the time). similar issue with lack of closing line value in baseball.
RufusPeabody,consensus among panelists is us sports betting will have a handle of $150-$250 billion in the next 10 years. though yass is hopeful if trading costs go down (wed need an exchange model here) we could see a trillion dollars. i for one am rooting for that.
SportsCheetah,we discussed our general approach during bowl season and discuss variance and other quantifiable (or not) factors among other things for the first 30 mins. then we break down each bowl through christmas in depth. its long but hit that 1.5x or 2x and fire it up.
capjack2000,"i'll play devil's advocate here and say that a higher hold on alt totals is warranted because of the higher variance and lower liquidity of numbers as they get further away from market median.

oh fanduel btw."
capjack2000,"i watched their last attempt at it last spring. it wasn't impressive. i'll watch again tonight. last season the commentators weren't sharp bettors by any stretch. they would say things like "" that is  a rebound for simmons the line on him getting a triple-double was +1200."""

dinkinc,my favorite tjf song...they are doing their accoustic set at vinyl in the hard rock tonight { thursday ]. anyone going and taking a picture with ritzy will get my first week of hockey plays free they are no longer purchasable.. think they come on at 8:00
dinkinc,sorry.  i was alive when the miracle mets won. the first round of the nba playoffs is a joke and no one tanks an entire season in baseball. plus players dont decide who plays where.  the royals played the giants in the world series pretty recently too
dinkinc,the line was always great. one of the them  mckinnon  is a top 5 player and the other two are top 25.  the depth was a major problem but they are better now. the defense is geared to play offensively. they have peaked at the right time
robpizzola,joey knish is a close friend of mine so we can make these jokes with each other. i let him live in my basement (which i built with 20 btc because i'm a cuck) when times were tough for him due to his horrible college football wagers.
robpizzola,i'm honestly surprised that mcdavid got nominated. frankly i'd give him the hart because there is no player more valuable to their team than he is even if his team is a complete and utter disgrace. i'm just shocked they gave a nomination to a non-playoff guy.
RASPicks,the  percent  of our portfolio that we release on service has been on the decline for years. it is down to 10 percent  or so currently.  we have gotten away from most of our full game plays on service not because of an inability to beat them.
RASPicks,focal point of 2018 ras college basketball service will be 2nd half plays.  we have hit 57.1 percent  on 2nd half plays over the past 3 seasons (434 plays).  this service isn't for everyone you must have ample outs time resources.  order page is now live at
VegasRefund,"second play of the game. rams scored a def. touchdown off of a steelers botched snap.

last year their defense played the easiest schedule in the #nfl by expected points added  dvoa.

suuma810,and going back to the op the question is whether you bank on a surprising leap at age 31 which would justify the market price tag or you start looking at a potential successor who will be significantly cheaper. i wouldnt fault the vikes for doing that.
suuma810,"the #seahawks  team total is a juicy 20.5 at pinnacle. they were held to 20 or less three times:

spanky,prop bets are hung by bookies to attract customers to bet normal stuff (nfl/nba).  exclusively betting props will get you limited or banned fast. to all aspiring pros: for longevity bet real stuff even if your edge is negative. the bookie-bettor relationship is a two way street.

aluckyaday,no it is not bonkers. you have to prove they have discriminated against your in an illegal way they  daily fantasy sports  have to tell you they are doing it! discrimination cases alway have to go to court or be settled out of court by mutual consent.
aluckyaday,the vig on each side of the bet is not always the same. you can say what it is on the whole market but not on each side. the fav/longshot bias is well know but there may be other reasons why books favour one side of another.
aluckyaday,i believe will also restrict you if you take prices that can be arbed at the time you take them even if you  daily fantasy sports  ultimately beat the close. a couple of data protection requests for trader notes on accounts i've had closed said as much.
aluckyaday,tbh traditionally my views are more tory than labour (admittedly becoming more socialist in my old age ) but like john major michael heseltine  ken clarke i could not bring myself to vote for what the tory party currently represents. i'd be ashamed to vote for them.
aluckyaday,even if the bet placement software running on the users device reacts to those suspensions in real time (it wont some bets will still be rejected) it is still frustrating to the customer as the market suspensions are out of line with the pictures they are watching.
aluckyaday,why should the government support racing rather than bookmakers? bookmakers will do what is best for their business not racing. racing seems to think it has a right to be treated preferentially. it needs to stand on its own four feet rather than expecting handouts from others.
aluckyaday,there is an interesting interview online somewhere with the head of one of these operations. cant remember which one possibly gvc. who explained that was their strategy. but they will pick and choose the states they want to operate in just like they do with european countries.
aluckyaday,interesting. guess that would catch the marginals the big +evs available on these offers tipping people over the restrictions line. although i would think most would only be restricted on these low limit bets. usually 10 percent  of max bet would be lower than their normal stakes?
aluckyaday,this is actually why i use the 2 measure. one looks at the closing price to see if i am beating it. the other looks at the chance of me getting a return if no edge exist in the price i took. that covers both above scenarios
aluckyaday,yeah. the edge comes more from the bet itself rather than the selections. its not really what ps are meant for but as i know there is an edge to the bet itself i just use the p-value to know i have enough data to play with.
aluckyaday,"updated figures with maximum drawdown assuming i have calculated it correctly.

singles profit 1066.71 roi 6.1 percent  max ddown 160.73
doubles profit 2423.07 roi 13.87 percent  max ddown 504.22
trebles profit 6050.30 roi 34.62 percent  max ddown 1412.45
acca profit 9968.29 roi 57.04 percent  max ddown 3162.61"
aluckyaday,a couple of examples. in the uk drones are flown over race courses streaming pictures faster than the books get them. in the us slow tennis umpires are targeted bets are placed after points before the books get the feed from the chair. its a worldwide business!
aluckyaday,i do think at some point a compromise will be reached. if it were me i'd implement a two level reduction factor. one for more efficient markets and one for recreational ones. allowing recreational sharps to stake more on the efficient markets. can i patent that please
aluckyaday,i guess they could say we void them all. we can't help it if they do not return to collect their refund. just out of interest what happens in the us to funds for bets voided but not returned? obviously online this is easier to deal with.
aluckyaday,but it is unlikely we will be able to put it right on the same terms maintaining the opt outs from the lisbon treaty we have been granted. a referendum that would be unlikely to stand if binding is no basis for making such a momentous decision.
aluckyaday,self exclusion has not really worked in the uk. more emphasis is being put on books to identify those at risk and proactively interact with them. how will the us react when you get the first cases of people stealing from their employers to fund their addiction?
aluckyaday,i assume that is what jason is attempting. time will tell if it succeeds but they are up against the marketing budgets of the softs to acquire customers. difficult to offer the range of bets and multiples that the softs do as well. and the loss leaders....
aluckyaday,yes i guess managing a points spread for a vegas book is a little different to managing 25000 bets per minute that sg's openbet software managed for this years grand national. online recreational betting is a completely different beast. might take some time to get used to...
aluckyaday,i would not say it means nothing in cycling. there are some big movements which can be driven by insider knowledge on team strategy for the day. have you actually tested your theories that closing line means nothing in illiquid sports? or is it just an opinion?
aluckyaday,she was about 500 on betfair when he called and said that was his favorite. i'd be very happy to be on that. should have listened to him. will be interesting if the 2nd half of the jury agree with the first re my vote ordering theory
aluckyaday,human brains finds randomness very difficult to understand. there has to be a reason for everything. evolution did not have sports betting in mind when this trait evolved. more staying alive in a predator infected world. that random pattern in the grass looks like a tiger. run!!!
aluckyaday,just reading on sbr and it looks like pinnacle adjust the limits depending on how much of the position the broker is willing to take. if the broker is passing 100 percent  of the bet to pinnacle the limit will be 50 percent  of pinneys normal limit.

EdMillerPoker,"dont want to belabor this but theres already someone operating that has decided to post tiny limits on everything and require you to send the rest for approval.

this is probably designed so they can say everyone gets the house limits but you can ask for more."
EdMillerPoker,"a model or prediction that cannot outpredict a betting market in at least a predicable subset of cases has zero economic value. you just prefer the market's implied prediction.

churning out these lines at massive scale is also worth zero. a zillion times zero is still zero."
EdMillerPoker,i'm confused by your numbers but ignoring that he's not really taking $5k from the casino's bottom line because that $5k would be paid out to other customers who of course would be likely to play some of it back into the machines but only a percentage.
EdMillerPoker,this is a high quality book imo with a lot of value add but i'm hoping this will be *the* book on sports betting at least for a while.. so i'm priced more in line with mainstream books on this and hoping it reaches a broader audience.
EdMillerPoker,impossible to build an in-game product from it without a dedicated human on your end watching the game on tv to make sure the feed is right. and at that point might as well just have your human collect the data and to hell with the feed
EdMillerPoker,sports betting media that focuses on the characters in sports betting may work. sports betting media that weaves betting information into traditional sports media coverage 100 percent  will work. watching a betting ticker scroll by while touts drone on will not work as a 24/7 tv channel.
EdMillerPoker,"""the problem for casual fans is that theyre going to lose money even faster betting these propositions. squares dont become sharp when analysis becomes more difficult.""

for me  that is  the thesis of the article and i agree with it. esp true if overrounds are higher in-game."
EdMillerPoker,ha. indeed.  for what  it is  worth  i never looked into a patent or anything at the time bc its a bad game. in fact my whole point for bringing it up was to make a point about how bad a game  daily fantasy sports  gpps are.
GolcondaFund,"get the suspicion we have a 'who is not on steelers -4?' 
top 5 pick in super contest.
multiple best pick of week of entire slate.
2 games in a row without ab this offense has struggled.
how often do you confidently lay points with russel wilson"
GolcondaFund,"the war in iraq? thousands for a regime change money grab using the fear of 9/11 to galvanize support. not to mention the millions of middle eastern people people you  daily fantasy sports  seem to care about...

...sounds like a case of recency bias and political grandstanding."
nonrandomalpha,the federal reserve is more impactful on asset prices than a president and obama has zero  percent  interest rates over his entire two terms. the fed actually raised rates 8x during trumps single term and yet equities have still rallied demonstrating the efficacy of his fiscal policy
nonrandomalpha,working in many of these trades are also not accompanied by life changing money or generous retirement accounts - and are not inclined to allow you to retire in your 20s if at all. but tell me more about how much andrew luck sacrificed for us all.
LeeSharpeNFL,"#1 i assume everyone's treating sb as neutral.

#2 is anyone modeling this? i'm skeptical.

#3 is not really a thing. the probability of winning four straight games is very different from the probability of winning a fourth game given that you've already won three straight games."
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah it tries to ""divide credit"" on pass plays between the passer and the receiver. but it gives 100 percent  credit to rushers on running plays (including scrambles).

so the result is rushing plays get weighted more which distorts the true value of qbs by qbr. :("
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is an interesting thought.

if gb beats det and no beats car earlier in the day than sea cannot get a bye.

but they then can rest starters vs. sf and lose on purpose they can go to philly instead of hosting vikings. 

which is better?"
LeeSharpeNFL,"my sports betting team's supercontest record by year (2019 w17 pending):

LeeSharpeNFL,"it has happened before. in fact the only two players in nfl history with a reception at 40+ years old are jerry rice and brett favre the latter with only one and having thrown it himself.

fantasy scores it ""all upside"" they get passing and receiving credit."
LeeSharpeNFL,"week 17 games since 2008 between a team playing for a playoff berth and/or improved seeding vs. a team eliminated from the playoffs are 35-37-1 against the spread.

not the largest sample but evidence is either the market is already adjusting to motivation or it doesn't matter."
LeeSharpeNFL,"also note that nflscrapr treats the return team as the possession team on kickoffs (not that kicking team).

though i would do this analysis as combining all special team play types and renormalizing so they're positive if good for the team of the plot bar in question."
LeeSharpeNFL,"everything bears are doing tells me pace and nagy are not aligned on trubisky. feels like pace is telling nagy he must start trubisky. but nagy doesn't trust him so only calls short dumpoffs.

so trubisky can't be further evaluated because a real offense isn't being called."
LeeSharpeNFL,"kind of working on a hack to my season simulator after  asked if i could show ""bye probability leverage"" for upcoming games. i couldn't yet. hoping for next week though. this code was written a long time ago and is in desperate need of a refactor :p"
whale_capper,even if we do see a high level im interested in having 8/1 or better on thiem in my pocket especially if the market favors domi in the match odds... might see nadal open -400 bet down to -300 if they meet in the sf or final
AndyMSFW,"didn't bet anything tonight.  if the cowboys  daily fantasy sports  spend the night with their head up their b-hole they should win and cover but obviously  that is  no guarantee.  i know a couple of smart cats on the over so there's that.

see you at halftime!"
AndyMSFW,"match-ups went 5-2-1 
outrights 0-2
top 20s 0-3 

even at 0.25 the amount of the match-up plays the long shots are eating into the profits.  hitting one is sexy and match-ups are boring but it might be the way to go if you wanna grind it out."
AndyMSFW,"i  daily fantasy sports  watch much hockey but i liked the parts where that college kid scored and also in the other game where the guy got knocked the fuck out. 
grabbed some isles 10/1 today so i'm now a part of #hockeytwitter thanks for having me."
JoeyKnish22,issue is obviously at bama but a chance they could lose that game and still make the playoff at 11-1 even without an sec title. again its unlikely due to schedule. but i think youre getting the 3rd to 5th best team in the country at 33/1.
JoeyKnish22,norm brings it up. theres a couple offshores that have recently taken a no risk acceptance approach to new accounts that have any level of immediate returns/show a pulse and theyre about to get put on blasty blast. even if those returns are very moderate. getting absurd.
TheKostos,"appreciate this compliment because this is what we strive for. to entertain and inform like we're sitting at the bar having a beer and talking about the spreads.

our guests are just fantastic. i learn so much every day hosting the show. and  it is  a blast."
TheKostos,"i know  it is  chalky but i like barca at napoli and for all narrative which is always fun.

messi is in superb form and after two consecutive #ucl collapses think they'll be laser focused under quique. 

looking for a big performance from griezmann who's been underwhelming."
TheKostos,for those who are currently unaware (you won't be for much longer) erling haaland is a 19-year-old norwegian striker who is stupid good. he's dominated the bundesliga since joining dortmund. feels like he's on the cusp of worldwide fame and this ucl campaign could get him there
LockyLockerson,"breaking news/injuries players missing for the first time (like pg last night etc.) won't really be factored because this is the first data point we have of that player being out.  market hasn't assessed that previously.  i tried to include what was not factored in under ""notes."""
LockyLockerson,this doesn't mean to fade the other side either necessarily. just there's most likely no angle. this is a good example i can think of where bettors only remember a theme/trend/whatever when it wins and they ignore all the losses.  so those were some losses this week.
LockyLockerson,atl mia: the largest spread because apparently dan quinn thru 10 games has lost a lot of people money in the preseason.  could care less maybe he decided to try more this year. you and me dan.  falcons +4.5 to win 1x and +180 for 1x more.
DannyParkins,doug marrone has extensive background with tight ends and offensive line head coaching experience and won at syracuse with a greg robinson qb won in buffalo and won in jacksonville with blake bortles. id be interested in adding him to matt nagys staff. plus has saints ties.
DannyParkins,i just finished the 2d half of the bulls game after a  show dinner... what the hell was that defensive plan in the 4th quaer? hey jim theyre trying to switch dunn off cp3. my god. that was insane. theyve actually been good defensively. what a loss.
DannyParkins,so the white sox clearly wanted wheeler and clearly wanted their fans to know they tried to get him. i'm just not sure  it is  good business or pr to make it known publicly you made the biggest offer and couldn't get someone to take your money.
DannyParkins,bears havent faced a lot of adversity in-season since nagy became coach. cody parkey incident ended the year and everyone left town. now his starting qb who people were already losing confidence in is hurt  roquan smith has a mystery personal issue. big test for young coach.
DannyParkins,sure titles dont have asterisks. the 2015 warriors dont apologize for love and kyries injuries. the 90s rockets dont apologize for mj being retired. the list goes on. but all titles are not created equal in nba history and beating this banged up warriors squad would qualify.
DannyParkins,sure its gorgeous and memorial day and all but ive got some serious jet lag and i havent watched the thrones finale and avoided like 98 percent  of all spoilers. my expectations for the episode are low but ill still be bummed its over. here goes nothin...
DannyParkins,4th or lower for me. he showed some progress and most coaches arent huge difference makers in the nba anyway and the porter trade showed theyre far from a marquee fa so stands to reason theyre far from a marquee coach without getting big time lottery luck.
DannyParkins,it is  already like that. kentucky is on tv more has better facilities better celebs at midnight madness a coach with more connections and yes better opportunities for corruption/money for players. coach cal clean? come on.  daily fantasy sports  be naive. players should get what they're worth
DannyParkins,yea its just a sport where good offense beats good defense but that doesnt mean they dont play defense which people use as a knock to dismiss the sport altogether. if its warriors/bucks in the finals itll be an impossible argument but facts dont seem to matter.
DannyParkins,hey chicago the  is an incredible place and its important that kids get a chance to see this piece of american history. also my man carrington is doing great work who deserves support. if you could help out id really appreciate it lets lock this goal up.
chadmillman,"i'm a giver ask anyone  

 knows that too. which is why it asked me to give you a $500 risk free bet for the breeders cup. 

14 races. make a bet worth up to $500 and lose get the cash back. but you won't you're a winner!."
Gingfacekillah,as you go through a course keep your objective in the back of your mind [eg. calculating a total etc]. make notes when you see something that might apply to your sports betting goal. then test it out. make some mistakes. just keep going. steady incremental progress.
Gingfacekillah,not really. when you factor in the intermittent bursts of online defamation to boot i wouldn't recommend it. that being said i wrote the book that i would've wanted when i started betting and i've received a lot of very positive feedback. so  that is  pretty cool.
Gingfacekillah,i hope you find the book to be a useful resource on your journey with sports modelling. also if you enjoy the book and have a chance i would very much appreciate hearing your feedback - please consider leaving a review on amazon. thanks for the support!
Gingfacekillah,we can't know for sure but this game is about pricing uncertainty. i'd seriously consider firing on this - but i'll wait to see if the market irrationally drives the line in our favour - since recency bias is the rationale behind this in the first place.
Gingfacekillah,"the other factor is that league revenues suffer if outcome of games is a foregone conclusion so we get:

- players play hard to preserve value but
- teams tank to get draft picks but
- league boosts tanking teams to ~0.250 with percent  to preserve revenues."
Gingfacekillah,good question. my take is that players are motivated to perform and win. lowering their percentages reduces their contract value so its not really in their interest to do so. tanking benefits the team via picks so its usually a top down decision. hence the min. restrictions.
Gingfacekillah,some modelling work on the nba today with xgboost and rf. found some interesting features. xgb test predicting at 68 percent  rf test predicting at 92.9 percent . rf test is breaking the theoretical prediction ceiling for nba so i assume something is wrong. train test tweak.
Gingfacekillah,thanks!  tweaked some of the tuning parameters: eta 0.001 gamma 5.23 max depth 10 this was about the best it would do. have to go back and look at underlying models and their feature selection and find a boost for rsq. had similar results for pointspread regression.
Gingfacekillah,he can apologize for every public art decision in the last 5 years while he's at it. if anybody can watch calgary's city council at work and think they give two hoots about the taxpayers in this city they're not paying attention. ditto for small business owners.
logan_matthews9,i think from a modeling perspective you could focus on the variables that have the greatest impact for that course. weather would be useful sure but if youve got 15+ years of data with probably 400+ rounds per year i think weather is going to be noisy
logan_matthews9,"full slate for today (in order of confidence):

PikachuBets,also stop fucking putting statistical terms in air quotes like a dyslexic retard who thinks that makes it less legit as a math concept when it just shows us that your expertise does not come from math. ps nobody actually reads your column so dont flatter yourself
PikachuBets,bro get a clue. after school prep academies most prominently the asian ones dominate the shsat testing market and have done so for over a decade. even white kids attend these in queens and brooklyn. theyre not ridic expensive at all but its not all internet lmfao
PikachuBets,fair. but cmon a star player staying in school isnt getting more education. hes taking the easiest shit like in unc grading scandal. diploma milling these kids doesnt provide an education. i think they should stay in school too but being poor is tough on these kids/families
adamchernoff,i think its something that gets overlooked. something the wife notices too. its more and more difficult to be able to be successful taking advantage of prices but still be present in every day life. super fine line to not be mentally occupied for the entire day.
adamchernoff,"well there is ""sharp"" money on both sides of many of these games so yes. 

none of this should make anyone change their process or approach but it does bring into question the strength of moves on sunday evening a week prior and sunday morning game day."
adamchernoff,no disagreement there. but thats tough throwing into cover 3 with less than 30 secs left from your 11 looking to pick up 60 yards. they get the ball back to start the 2h too. cant get on him for that - which is usual to say.
adamchernoff,every price point how can you group everything together and paint the bettors in the market into just two categories. the game crosses an enormous range of outcomes and at each point the handicap and edge changes. ignoring that is completely foolish. to end this perhaps the...
adamchernoff,"a lot of bets right now being placed at halftime based on the ""adjusted"" full game line. if you are using that as an indication of value you are likely misreading the situation and making a poor bet. this episode explains why as will the thread below:"
adamchernoff,of my goodness! it blew me away. toured around a number of places and couldn't believe it. never tasted anything like it coming from where i come from. have tried to make it back here but have never quite been able to replicate it as it tasted.
adamchernoff,"international tournaments - especially this copa america - have a ton of uncertainty early. that was a 17 percent  move 14 percent  of which occurred during the match and only 3 percent  during ""market hours"". market pricing is never great early but adjustments occur extremely quick  accurately."
adamchernoff,the park adjusted hits produces a final projected hits number. a regression is run on all games dating back to 2005 (34000 game sample size) to determine the most likely number of runs scored based on projected hits. both teams are combined to produce total expected runs.
adamchernoff,"most bettors in the market are going to cite ""age"" as the main reason to oppose uruguay (muslera godin caceres lodeiro suarez stuani cavanni all 30+). but in a tournament full of turnover the experience of this side under tabarez and all the continuity is very valuable."
adamchernoff,for the record ive got zero issue with this happening at a recreational level (although i never will do it). anyone golfing is better than anyone not golfing. whatever it takes to get out there and have fun. ive just got an issue with pros doing it.
adamchernoff,dont think you need a slogan. just do a subtle rebrand as propswap exchange. add little tools that show how much people saved live chart market prices  start an odds ladder. play off the exchange buzzword slowly growing in us. be a market place not a marketplace.
adamchernoff,starting to see a lot of baseball is my best season tweets which means we are getting very close to two months into the baseball season when many go broke betting baseball and football is my best season tweets begin...which means its getting closer to football season.
Ccon8181,true rick ive heard pros say there is an edge in preseason. my model uses simulation and its impossible to simulate results with so much unknown. so i effectively have no edge in preseason. looking forward to the start of the real season though.  enjoy your weekend
Ccon8181,big time disappointed going 1-1 yesterday and not hitting the under. flight to san diego wanted to be bringing more cash with me but solid month n a half nonetheless. decent y touchdown . hope to cash at least one more finals bet. big things to come.
Ccon8181,no doubt embid is worry value but have been saying it ball sticks to him. with embid out reddick was $ and the ball moved... plus embid didnt feel like playing today?? he was hoping sixers lose so everyone would miss him attention hor. sit it out
Ccon8181,kicking the  field goal  there gives the vikings a slightly greater opportunity to win the game. even by your own numbers. maybe you defending the decision to go for it is a knee jerk reaction to you having to over in that contest. leave it at that
ToddFuhrman,i have plenty of views of the behavior of athletes but when it comes to sports betting every player out there has a value and  that is  it; if we only bet on good guys wouldn't have a bankroll left (as jaded as all of this sounds)
ToddFuhrman,i respect that completely; bettors always discuss market inefficiency that inevitably exists with more teams but most folks are limited by the amount of time they have to effectively know 100's of teams in  college football / college basketball  if  it is  not their full time pursuit
ToddFuhrman,cant imagine what its like for these kids with cameras in their homes waiting to get drafted; imagine if that happened to all of us out of college waiting for the phone to ring on our first job...my reel would have been 6+ mos of nothing happening
12Xpert,pinnacle closing. remember when you use level stakes you won't necessary get things summing to zero (or to the equivalent of the margin). in fact had you bet either all home or aways so far both would be in profit 0.21 and 37.9 respectively. draws are -8.61.
12Xpert,it might seem unrigorous to me and you but these brands particularly those answerable to shareholders are in the business of maximising profit. hence they will run a tight ship and do things properly. if traders were found to be making poor decisions well what would happen?
12Xpert,"this to understand what ""winner"" means.
it means a bettor with profitable expectation expected value positive alpha etc not profits. as i keep reiterating to be a successful bettor you need to forget about the results and look at the methods of how you achieve expected value"
12Xpert,it will have been a tweet and i would guess it would have been to show that betfair racing starting prices would be efficient. you're probably thinking of the bookmaker favourite-longshot bias which ensure punters have a much smaller  percent  loss at shorter odds than longer odds.
12Xpert,obviously a lot of last chapter is out of date now but the broader science is still valid. i think the strength of it lies in contextualising contemporary (and man-made) climate change within a wider natural climate system that responds over many different timescales. chps 2  5.
12Xpert,presumably also most of the pros won't really be that skilled. i mean  it is  not particularly hard to get banned by recreational bookmakers. so non pros will simply be following those wise enough to beat soft books and soon they will find themselves banned too right?
12Xpert,certainly something worth thinking about but on what grounds do you think it should be considered? not just what you see but something more fundamental about the nature of betting outcomes. besides 1 in 10 years is still really only 1 in 500 weeks if betting weekly.
12Xpert,the trouble is that betfair is likely equally efficient to pinnacle so when they hold higher prices my belief is that  it is  more probable the pinnacle price is more inefficient. and vice versa. would love it if someone has tested this and could report on it.
12Xpert,"ah right. so when money is nudging  that is  bad being as it is inevitably subversive but when jc and other 'well-meaning' politicians are nudging  that is  good?

this also rather assume that people are too stupid to realise the are being nudged. obviously you're an exception."
12Xpert,that is  what they wanted. no other country will want to face it. ultimately it is a doomed project unless it federalises and becomes a single county with single fiscal policy defence strategy etc. etc. see what the germans say when they are faces with that reality.
12Xpert,i hope  it is  clear to the var refs too. i suspect it won't be but if they all argue it is clear despite contentious decisions i suspect they will sill be arguing precisely what it was that was clear to them. time will tell as always.
12Xpert,i mixture of greed and overconfidence greases the wheels of touting. almost none do anything other than chance. almost all and the customers who throw money at them believe that can't be true. when i show them the data cognitive dissonance takes root from which denial blossoms
12Xpert,good for you for staying strong. all of us suffer mental disorders in different ways including saying stupid things on tv to garner attention. but lets celebrate the debate that springs from different opinions and recognise that people have reasons for why they say what they say
12Xpert,oh this firm has no morality at all. they ruined the business of many affiliates who spent years promoting their brand in the space of 4 weeks claiming bad affiliates presented too much liability but still continue to work with the very worst of those affiliates today..
12Xpert,"the book i wrote about the story was ""how to find a black cat in a coal cellar: the truth about sports tipsters"". very few of the tipsters were intentionally and knowingly cheating (e.g. changing results) but many were clueless about their own (lack of) forecasting abilities."
12Xpert,indeed  that is  basically what i do visually here just without the stats. but still the problem is you are using samples  1 to compare expected with actual. if you do this for individual bets your outcomes are either 0 or 1 and that gets us nowhere.

mschwimer,podcast best bet in nfl record now 8-5-1 after 4 straight winning plays.  always fun to get hot in a tiny sample.  click the link if you want to know what our game of the week is this week.  plus 7 props for the ravens/jets game tonight!
mschwimer,question to all the vegas bettors out there.  for 11amet/8ampt start times for ncaa basketball games how do you get bets down on those games?  do certain books open early? do you put them in the night before? or are those games just never available to bet?
mschwimer,"correct. bernie madoff broke the law and is in jail. 

the deal is on our website for all to see. our guarantee is right there! if we break that then we are in breach. period. also false advertising. we would be breaking the law on multiple levels."
mschwimer,"no. if you are +1 unit you are profitable even after paying our fees!

this would all be so much easier if you would go to the website and read our detailed pdf on how this entire thing works. if we are negative units you get 10k"
mschwimer,we realize all of this. yes. we have enough to fund more than 2k packages right now. if we need to raise more we will. but i highly doubt it because people like to chirp. but they dont like to put their money where their mouth is.
mschwimer,so do we have a deal. you spend 300k on 100 packages. we put $1m in an escrow of your choice. after 17 weeks if we are down units vs. betcris line you get the $1m. if not we get the $1m.  do we have a deal?
mschwimer,baseball is a great test case for isa. several companies are in it now. most do a really good job. but we have 1 bad apple that makes us all look bad. regulation is 100 percent  required so the bad actors do not get into the space.
RufusPeabody,i once ran (on the street not the sidewalk) the 7 miles of las vegas blvd from mandalay bay to the fremont st experience parking garage at 4am wearing a suit  dress shoes  i only stopped once to get a slurpee at the 7-11 on charleston.
RufusPeabody,good point about the tj. he's also not cheap anymore. projected arb salary of $5.7 mill (per  this year and probably closer to $10 mill next year. won't be part of a contending o's team regardless. question is would value increase if they dealt him midseason.
RufusPeabody,"there are sharp bettors on the other side who disagree with the play. 

when the tout releases the picks you didn't know which subset will be profitable at the release price and which wouldn't but after the market reacts you have new information to consider. (5/6)"
RufusPeabody,this is not a model for predicting how good the teams are; this is a model that predicts how the  college football  playoff committee ranks the teams. it doesn't make much sense doing it after 5 weeks but i was curious what it would look like.
RufusPeabody,here's the point i was trying to make on the podcast: for every game you have winning bettors that will be on both sides at the same number. if the market number is -4 flat you'll have some winning bettors laying -4 and some taking +4.
RufusPeabody,i applaud you for the transparency. however i was talking about a monitor that does not take ads and does not require you to trust that a third party doesn't have a conflict of interest. something on the blockchain would make it impossible to fudge records.
SportsCheetah,for what  it is  worth i asked  what their  in-game price was immediately after the rams  touchdown  with 14:46 remaining in the 1q and he said they had it projected rams -10.5 with exactly 50 percent  probability of landing on either side of the 10.5 number.
SportsCheetah,"you sound like a ravens fan

this will be the positive swing imo:

the rams played zone coverage 66 percent  of the time this season 4th highest in the nfl.

the ravens played man 59 percent  of the time this season 5th highest in the nfl."
SportsCheetah,nothing wrong with covering local teams and podcasting. have to start the grind somewhere. i could be wrong about the info but like i said before its a trusted source. she just missed my point and also referred to me as faceless which is extremely ironic.
capjack2000,"i use ""vig"" to say theoretical balanced hold percentage. overround is a uk term imo but essentially the same thing. 

i always have a spreadsheet of sportsbetting calcs open so i typically post ""vig"" if i didn't i'd add together the implied probabilities and use overround."
capjack2000,"there's a vast difference between being able to code and being able to construct a remote control system that does not make calls to windows underlying rdp infrastructure (or ica) which would be detectable. 

much cheaper to hire a nj runner which is what most do."
capjack2000,"last night's simpsons episode featured commentary on the effect legalized online gambling has had on the mob; a food truck; and a $50000 wager on lehigh basketball. 

i had to double-check the closing credits for my name. 

once this baby hits frinkiac expect plenty of memes."
capjack2000,"similar. both offer wagering at casinos tracks otb and online/mobile.

in will have a lower licensing fee and lower tax rate which creates a lower barrier to entry for smaller companies. in allows betting on in-state college teams. in likely goes live during nfl this year."
capjack2000,i understand the entertainment value of gambling content. im not a fan of that when it teaches bad betting habits. lock it in is not as bad as say barstool. however they seem to have more joke writers than sports analysts...and neither seem to be well-paid.
capjack2000,this.  some could argue nj has already reached saturation on online casinos (we have one branded after a strip club!) but  it is  clear that even with online sportsbooks outnumbering bm books there's still room for growth. the single sports skin rule in pa is short-sighted.
dinkinc,a few weeks ago vegas played at nashville and they added a second to the clock before a faceoff with about 25 seconcds to go...vegas tied the game with .7 of a second left and won in ot...how can there be no consistancy with added time
dinkinc,it is a very stressful time of the year for so many people... fight through it and reach out for help... you can get better and when you do you can make a difference by being an example for someone else  daily fantasy sports  give up
robpizzola,very likely that i'll be doing a periscope at some point tonight leading up to thursday night football. i have a good friend's wedding on saturday night so need to be realistic with the possibility of a sunday morning periscope which is close to zero percent.
RASPicks,fading the public could be useful is the rare instances where square public money influences the market but this doesn't happen and/or isn't easily identifiable often enough in today's markets.  otherwise if we agree it doesn't work blindly how is it useful as a first filter?
RASPicks,it isn't just ras.  my team typically subscribes 4-5 different guys depending on time of year and that is not counting free people we keep tabs on.  most aren't even long term winners but we're able to find value in them for the reasons i mentioned.
VegasRefund,hit 50k today. seems like yesterday i started this up.. and would never have expected to get anything close to support ive received. i appreciate you all and truly enjoy this wild world of gambling twitter. cheers to all the things ahead and keeping it free.
VegasRefund,if tiger had drained that putt i might have cried.. regardless hes back. everyone has their own teams to root for across the country but tiger is one of the few that can get an entire nation rooting for him to the level that he does.
ProfessorShine,point spreads matter. if an angle identifies team x doing something situational it would help to see if the team is a fav 1-34-67+ or a dog at certain numbers.  a fav or dog less than 3 points is very different than 7+ dogs or favs.
suuma810,"the #jets were averaging 6.7 yards per dropback (11th)  3.4 yards per run (29th) since darnold is back. the bengals were allowing 8.5 yards per pass (32nd). at halftime cin had an 89 percent  chance of winning.

blame the execution not the lack of run calls."
suuma810,"the #eagles rank 9th in dvoa. d has been playing better lately. jeffery  johnson back soon. their remaining schedule:

mia
nyg 2x
dal (at home)
was

i wouldn't be surprised if they run the table. they got the tiebreaker over dallas (common games win vs. jets)."
suuma810,"#jets offseason:

-hired a ~questionable~ hc/oc/dc combo
-only got one new starter for a bad offensive line
-didnt sign/draft a center
-didnt upgrade cb  edge 
-paid big money to a rb the hc didnt want
-fired the gm after letting him maneuver free agency  the draft"
suuma810,wie gesagt ob er es wert ist knnen wir wie bei vielen qb-vertrgen diskutieren. aber an dem vertrag an sich sehe ich nichts verwerfliches. minimum drei jahre und $20-22m per war zu erwarten und sieht nach zwei jahren im ligaverhltnis ganz anders aus. agree to disagree
ClevTA,"my 2019:got engaged in july bought a new house in october  married in november. thinking more good news might be coming soon . 
also had the great privilege of working with  and crew.  hopefully i was able to provide valuable insight. cheers to a great 2020"
ClevTA,would like to know the last and how many power 5 teams won every single game in regular season and conference title game by double digits. i cant recall any. i know bama had done it last year before only beating georgia last year by 3.
ClevTA,i just dont recall any precedent in the past where a team goes on the road to a top 10-15 team wins ugly and drops. winning ugly by 1 at michigan has never been treated the same as beating northwestern by 1 for example. thats all
ClevTA,if u add up all those win probabilities if the spreads are close to actuality then the browns are projected to win 3.53 games from here on out.  so round up to 4 to be fair and u end up with 8-8 as most likely ending
CizzlingSports,based on mike's prior statements there's of course a non-trivial chance paying out $10k to a few subs in exchange for good press (see for example the settlement in the suit against his other company) is part of some longer con that doesn't involve selling picks
CizzlingSports,"started selling  college football  picks two seasons ago. he got worked in 2017-2018 losing -18.8 units. he then predictably claimed he only gambles ""for fun"" (after taking subscribers' money of course). he then sold picks again for 2018-2019 and got worked again - -11.9 units. lol"
CizzlingSports,"4 total games in which he threw more than 7 passes; 2  touchdown 's coming in 2015 under 5 minutes where mia was getting stomped by 28 (4:51) and 24 (0:05 lol) respectively immediately prior to each score.

historical shredding tho.

# worst of all time"
spanky,"exactly. a bookmaker who complains about steam is not writing on action. 

i know the worlds best and they all welcome steam trains planes helicopters bulldozers etc... a bookmaker is there to write bets. complaining on the type of bets he writes makes him a dressmaker."
spanky,"i enjoyed this.  sounds very promising.  it seems the only vital missing piece is market awareness and market timing.  
thinking that it takes all sharps instead of just one to move markets shows mike's lack of experience in this field. 
nonetheless i hope they overcome it."
spanky,i hope to see sport lines being traded like other financial instruments. the worlds greatest trading institutions are able to evaluate stocks and buy low and sell high. they will eventually do the same with sport lines. achieving liquidity is only possible with enough big players
spanky,everyone thought pinnacle/cris was nuts taking more online than they did on the phone.  every nevada shop does the exact opposite taking more over the counter vs the app.  why? because they dont have an auto line mover and are rightfully afraid of over exposure (5/6)
spanky,"two job postings:

1.) any java coders in the ny/nj area (no remote hires) seeking employment in the exciting field of professional sports betting hit me up. we are overwhelmed with work and need help keeping up. 

2.) we could also use an office assistant. contact"
spanky,"was on a roll until he referred to bettors as punters.  

ey years old vinny since when has a bookie from brooklyn compared a kicker on 4th down to betting?! 

come on vinny!!! dont fall into these european traps!  whats next?  you gonna call soccer football"
spanky,"two thoughts: 

please round off limits to the nearest hundred.  booking an extra 73.4 shouldnt be a grave risk.

these limits beg for manipulation. bet 26 bucks in flagged account the wrong way to move line hard. then come back the other way in unflagged account"
spanky,"grand opening has been awesome. 

 knows his stuff and is a super nice guy.

both  and  praised the old school legends who paved the way.  

a few years from now when this joint is #1 i can always say i was there since day 1. #honored"
spanky,also given that  has many of its race books partake in the pari-mutual pool they should be required to go above and beyond to inform their customers that this is non pari-mutual location. regular guy seems william hill sign he thinks its all the same everywhere.
spanky,a dressmaker is a bookmaker by name only -who spends his time making dresses or trying on dresses rather than managing his book to maximize revenue utilizing all information from all types of customers. the monkeys that consistently move on air disgrace this very noble profession
spanky,vd made half a million on selling a losing pick on the sb and went to eat a big steak dinner afterwards.  you apologize for giving out free advice and then write paragraphs explaining variance.  while everyone appreciates your kindness recognize you dont owe anyone anything.
spanky,lowering limits has become rare. its much easier for the joint to just kick the sharp player out.  i lose many accounts weekly with all my betting partners but the asians have this unbelievable ability to regenerate new accounts constantly. the asians run the gambling world.
spanky,i agree and apologize to any dressmakers that i have indirectly insulted.  i however completely disagree on your opinion of bookmakers.  a bookmaker is a very honorable craft that i deeply respect.  i have had the honor and privilege to meet some of the world's best.
spanky,every offshore book i play in grades games that affect all customers simultaneously. i know this because i have many different accounts at the same sports book with the same plays. on the other hand  software seems to grade players not games?!?  what the fuck !!
spanky,knowing when (not just what) to bet is very important.  for example while not a hard fast rule taking an nfl dog and/or under for sunday night or monday night is best done closer to kickoff as the public usually drives the favorite and total up.(4/4)
spanky,despite me not being able to bet in new jersey i still bet offshore.  when i no longer can bet offshore and provide for my family then i may consider your point.  until then i chose to extract money from bookmakers rather than my fellow bettors.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh for sure but obviously picking off soft markets is not their mo. if youre trying to build big complex models i could understand how those models could struggle in the early season when they have to choose between current year and prior year data etc.
aluckyaday,no they  daily fantasy sports . that is a fundamental misunderstanding of recreational bettors. they bet for the enjoyment. the excitement of having money on the game they are watching. this is the market the recreational books are serving. betting professionally is a completely different game
aluckyaday,they only have to do what uk law compels them to do. why do something that would be bad for business if you  daily fantasy sports  have too? if you  daily fantasy sports  like how they operate  daily fantasy sports  bet with them. its your choice.
aluckyaday,i think the difference is targeting and accountability. in a traditional news outlet you could only send the same lie to everybody. now you can send different lies to different people. the news outlets were  accountable for what they say. fake social media accounts are not.
aluckyaday,you are looking at things from a selfish point of view though. why not explain why they do it? how it benefits recreational punters? you are not their target market why should they keep you happy to the detriment of their best customers? its just  business.
aluckyaday,"i guess it is not only a question of how big the risk is but what the consequences are if they get it wrong. which is worse a jockey or horse being seriously injured or the ""wrong"" horse winning the race because the conditions have changed?"
aluckyaday,i guess it is because to become part of that coalition they dropped some of their major manifesto pledges. who says they won't do that again? i hate to say it but in our fptp system a vote for them is a vote for the unknown.
aluckyaday,being a donny lad i'd be interested to know whether your support for the boris deal is because you are representing the views of your constituents or because unlike your party you personally believe it is in the best interest of the people the party represent?
aluckyaday,the other issue some have with nish is his lack of clv. personally i'm ok with that as my views on closing line value tend to differ from the likes of  . i think joseph is slowly begrudgingly moving in my direction on that one .
aluckyaday,i should have said impossible to tell from historical data. the only option we have is to do what   is doing. monitor the selections of all the pros from a point going forward and see how that population compares to what you would expect by chance.
aluckyaday,deal or no deal you are going to be hearing about brexit for at least the next 10 years. everything good to happen will be because of it and everything bad to happen will be its fault too. sorry to be the bearer of bad new...
aluckyaday,oi that is my idea! the big issue would be how do you determine the closing line. sure lots of pinney traders would like to play your game  as marco blume put it i can't judge my traders on the closing line because they set it!
aluckyaday,very true. the question should be is this a one off a genuine shop mistake? or are they accepting them routinely? all tickets should be scanned when written so in theory rejected. but is the scanning system systematically accepting them and then just settling as singles?
aluckyaday,why? they are serving a market. a market that can not be provided by sharp books. the fact that you personally can not bet what you want with them is pretty much irrelevant. their model works and they will generate large tax revenue for the state.
aluckyaday,as  daily fantasy sports  have a constitution constitutional important issues are usually settled by precedent and the courts not referendum. in the uk there has only ever been 3 national referendum. two on the eu and one on the voting system. certainly not a regular occurrence.
aluckyaday,more useful than having nothing. without predictions planning can not be done. the planners are aware of the variance. you can get life insurance even though their is a large variance in life expectancy. without a prediction model for life expectancy that would not be possible.
aluckyaday,the us is only a small part of the global gambling market. it will not contribute that much to worldwide liquidity. americans seem to think sports gambling does not exist outside the us! you do know where to get a big bet down at the moment?
aluckyaday,but i can buy a 5000 bottle of wine in a restaurant.  it is  not the absolute amount that is the issue but affordability combined with the genetic or psychological dispositions of the gambler. some people lose 5000 on a single bet some over 1 million!
aluckyaday,yep. unless you can understand at least a-level (for our us friends probably freshman degree level ) math(s)  you  daily fantasy sports  have to have studies it just have the ability to learn it if required modeling (and successful pro gambling) is probably not for you.
aluckyaday,if you  daily fantasy sports  believe me maybe betfair's ex ceo will convince you. in his 2014 ceo review betfair's then ceo corcoran said; the exchange appeals greatly to many consumers but does not fully address the mass marke touchdown ue to perceived and real complexity.
aluckyaday,this is totally overlooked by people commentating on the game. that vast majority do not bet to win they are betting for the excitement. the vig is the price they pay to get it. books are selling dopamine and there is a huge market for it.
aluckyaday,"do you know if they delete records/tipsters? is not a distribution of t-scores is the best way to do it  rather than do each tipster individually collect all the tips calculate the t-scores for each tipster plot the distribution and marvel at the ""gaussianess"" of it"
aluckyaday,"single arbs are not really a problem. arbing is a whole industry. sharp books ""employ"" arbers to make +ev bets for themselves by capitalising on soft books loss leaders/mistakes. once american books open themselves up to this i doubt they will be so happy with arbers!"
aluckyaday,this is very often overlooked variance is the friend of a negative expected value bettor and the enemy of a +ev one. ask any lottery jackpot winner if they care that their bet was -ev! better say big rollovers excepted before some clever dick chimes in!
aluckyaday,i just get the impression they set the vote announcement order once the votes are known to increase the tension. did they not swap the order of the jury/public vote announcement as well the last couple of years? maybe i'm remembering things that did not happen!
theFirmAISports,"conference weekend
#nflplayoffs - picks with probability of success:

patriots +3 (57 percent ) win
saints -3 (53 percent ) lose

43-26-1 overall (62 percent  win rate)

i wont even complain about the horrible no call in the saints game... 

but patriots will win the superbowl"
joeytunes2,best way to go upon sportsbetting is to look at it by year not daily. you cant have a chase mentality. nor week mentality. biggest mistake is the sunday night bail out. curb the demons accept a losing week. knowing  it is  not going to last.
joeyisaks,some form of ubi is a necessary program for the automation generation and to prepare for all the jobs about to be lost the results would be great. im rich it doesnt effect me but i touchdown  help the poor which would help the economy huge
joeyisaks,in grand slams since 2014 quarters and onward there has only been 7 retirements in 140 matches . part of what makes the majors different and more impressive of a title is managing the physicality - no one wants best of 3 ben let it go!!!
joeyisaks,cowboys fans started driving it up right after bears game.. i also need to get good seats due to my old age/ poor eye vision. and im not really a fan of either team all those add up to just passing on going to the game
EdMillerPoker,i think hes good at twitter. he pushes back against every criticism with logic muddies the waters and will soon be pointing to  college basketball  picks and saying my record speaks for itself. hes going to be very convincing to ppl who dont know whats up.
EdMillerPoker,with due respect to the first movers in nj what youre seeing across the board so far is basically the demo product. the focus is on making front end look good but once you engage with it for a while you see whats not implemented yet.
EdMillerPoker,this is not a slam on anyone as  it is  hard (and expensive) to build good games. but imo  it is  reasonable for gambling industry and media to evaluate innovations (not just in sports but casino too) at least in part in the way i've described.
GolcondaFund,"gotta love the twitter experts trying to make sense of ravens loss by pointing out ""still young lj and look at those stats!"" when even mark ing. himself admitted they got handled.

why? 

ego lack of preparation not having plan b buying into media hype. #rememberthetitans"
GolcondaFund,"we do this for march madness too. verry helpful to lead out on the handicap.
sometimes a line is so off we think we are missing intel. but that is rare i'd guesstimate.
week 3 looks more accurate than week 2's shennanigans by a long shot."
nonrandomalpha,win probablity is a joke. this looks cool so nice job on that but i wish some of you guys with these talents would focus less on finding new ways to visualize this poor reflection of reality and more time developing a more accurate win probability.
nonrandomalpha,of course due to the intrinsic volatility high level of randomness and lack of control doing this for prolonged periods will inevitably fatigue you. similar to professional equity traders who are typically coked up in order to keep up and usually dont last beyond their 30s
nonrandomalpha,we took jets. looking at the pats game plan v dolphins was very watered down and was only 7-0 midway thru q2 and only 20-0 end q3. the dolphins historic ineptitude helped blow this out in the end. jets far more competent - even with injuries.
nonrandomalpha,"so many whiny ucf fans' hearts were broken this weekend but not when you live bet + capitalize on mispricings in the market. 

we been patient with live trades the past couple weekends but hit this while it was hot 

multi-sport total return strategy: +23.5 percent"
nonrandomalpha,geez you sneak out a win v a non-playoff worthy auburn who is disappointed + disinterested af to play freakin ucf in orlando and your entire decade is made? this speaks volumes to the relevance (or lack thereof) of your programs success the last 10 years.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah they say it comes from seeing favorites win playoffs games by more than expectation. i do wonder how much of that is ""splits happen"" i'm generally wary of narratives that playoff games are different from regular season games. (but i should probably examine my priors.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,i think i  daily fantasy sports  rest but i'm not sure. i plugged the games into my model and it showed sea is more likely to win minutes at sea than sea at phi but it wasn't by a ton.  it is  a close call imo.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i've not heard of anyone examining this on the individual level (agree pff likely the people to do it).

but it  it is  not strong enough to show up on the team outcome of plays then  it is  probably not worth talking about on the broadcast."
LeeSharpeNFL,"removing fumbles seems to help both offensive and defensive stability a little.... but hurts special team stability. maybe some recovery nonrandomization in that scenario? or more of a skill there?

total xepa predicts itself much better than expected points added when plays are weighted this way."
LeeSharpeNFL,"yup. the lack of awareness of one's privilege that someone has to have to make the ""why didn't they come forward immediately"" argument is astounding.

no idea whether garrett or rudolph is telling the truth but ""he didn't say it right away"" is a terrible argument."
LeeSharpeNFL,"buf has an interesting remaining schedule of both easy interesting and hard games.

in general my model expects more variance the market though i think there may be overcorrection in team ratings for it from stuff in the early weeks? this has been a bizarre season."
AndyMSFW,"just did the sunday rundown   with  and grabbed a couple early totals.
atl/arz o49.5 -110 (5dimes)
bal/cin u48 -105 (lowvig)

that over is likely gone but i'd still play up to like 51 on that for sure.  doesn't appear that the balto under is taking $$$"
AndyMSFW,"lots of show finales get savaged (cue "" daily fantasy sports  stop believing"").  i'm not sure i can think of very many satisfying endings even from some of the great shows of late.  that said breaking bad nailed it (and obviously newhart for the older crowd)."
AndyMSFW,everything.  the player's union is toothless since the threat of a strike for higher wages is laughable.  so  it is  come down to trying to guilt owners into paying more money than the market deems necessary.   it is  tough for the gals but them's the breaks.
JoeyKnish22,zach. im gonna be honest with ya. i have no idea lol. theres 2000x scenarios based on which games they win and which games the other wc teams might lose. somebody smarter than me might be able to calculate it. i just bet the 50/1 lol.
JoeyKnish22,maybe saying his price potentially presented value if x and y scenarios occur but it more came off as wow we should bet this cause isnt he the front runner. at this moment hes likely not even the best candidate to bet on his own team.
JoeyKnish22,"does it bother me that im spending hours a week trying to grind out a couple percent edge in college football while some pimple face gaming teenager makes a million a year to play dota before puberty?

why yes yes in fact it does bother me."
JoeyKnish22,theres a quite plausible scenario simmons can average a triple double (if his shooting really is improved) on a team with potential to have the best record in the nba. which makes a reasonably strong case for mvp consideration at 110-125/1 definitely worth the sprinkle imo.
TheKostos,i'm sorry i'm still stuck on the clapper saying he had cooper and cobb out for the 4th down play because they needed rest. lol.  it is  4th and (maybe) the season!! why are you paying these guys if they can't perform in the big moments????
TheKostos,my fav is in my biggest buy-in league 14 teams 8 make the playoffs i'm the 2 seed playing the 7 seed and our two teams scored the most points. like  that is  my reward for getting the 2 seed??  that is  fantasy football for ya!!!
TheKostos,the 1pms started as a tragedy and slowly evolved into comedy. literally every red zone cutaway was something negative. multiple instances of split screens where neither thing i needed to happen happened. i was furious until about 2:30 and then submitted to the chaos and laughed
TheKostos,"quick note on #thebachelor premiere:

loved it. loved inclusion of hannah b. hope she joins the house. will be fascinating watching her go from total babyface to hated heel and how she'll react to it. hugely interesting social experiment.

 it is  brilliant tv. 

kudos to abc."
LockyLockerson,"also just typed this in a dm to someone so figured it would help many.  the point of the sharing of the nba projections isn't always just like a robotic ""3 points off auto bet beep boop"" without critical thinking even a  little of it 1/"
LockyLockerson,"""florida has their conference opener against kentucky away next week classic sandwich game after the miami win super-flat""

florida won in a shutout 45-0 covering the pinnacle close of 44.5.  now ask yourself if they won 42-0 if you would really believe ""sandwich spot"" was why"
LockyLockerson,after games start tomorrow a lot of sites take a lot of bets off the board for the season.  futures come down and considering florida-miami is a game in week 0 the market will be different when it re-opens.   let us  get our finalized bets together!
EliHershkovich,"with everyone who's stayed in the draft louisville possibly a top 10? no chance. but agreed cards' conference is in for a dip. 

top two top-three seed. mack almost got to a final four and this group is 100 percent  talented enough to earn a trip."
DannyParkins,dude the expert handicappers ive asked on  say its gonna be 3 points or less most likely im saying thats wrong. its not some outlandish stance to say the team on the longest winning streak in the country and the defending champs is the best team.
DannyParkins,it blows my mind how many people are being willfully disingenuous when it comes to this nba and china story. most if not all of the critics dont really care about communism or human rights violations in china they just love yelling hypocrisy about the nba.
DannyParkins,the question as i see it with mitch for now is simple: was the denver gameplan an abberation because of circumstances (fangio altitude difficulty of winning in denver in september etc) or an admission from nagy that mitch cant execute the offense he wants to run?
DannyParkins,so theres the news ill be popping up on not only the gambling show but also filling in on other  shows as called for. its a really ambitious cool venture. give that account a follow and lets build this thing. nothing changes with  or sunday nights.
DannyParkins,the cubs still feel like the 3rd best team in the national league behind the dodgers and braves. fangraphs has them at 71 percent  to make the playoffs. if they get in as a division winner i'd guess they'll be like 10-12:1 to win it all.
DannyParkins,mentioned him on the show a couple times yesterday but wanted to shoutout  not only for his tireless work on getting legalized sports betting in illinois approved but also for being an invaluable resource to the media to help inform the public on whats going on.
DannyParkins,ok the reactions to this tweet are hilarious. spiegs is an emotional baseball romantic who very easily could have been crying about feeling overwhelmed. but what youre seeing in this picture is embarrassment upon hearing he called runners dead when they made outs on the bases.
Gingfacekillah,my biggest concern with  daily fantasy sports  (collusion notwithstanding) was always the knowledge asymmetry surrounding ownership  percent . a little disconcerting that the platform has this crucial piece of info and the pool is estimating it. made the whole thing susceptible to scandal from outset imo.
Gingfacekillah,in watching this game i saw mia play about as expected but tor 3pt shooting was red hot (21 3ps) and their minutes were a little jumbled up. mia had some difficulty finding open 3pt looks too and opted to play this game in the paint/post.
Gingfacekillah,pretty good rsq here. take a look at the feature selection for some ideas about repeatable skills that are within a team's control. also of note is that if you can predict point totals you can combine this with pythagorean expectation models of the [(pf^13)/(pf^13+pa^13)] sort.
Gingfacekillah,thanks! you're so right.  that is  what started this msc pursuit for me - i realized all rating systems are paired comparisons that use linear algebra matrices to derive their ratings. i realized i have to understand this process in order to formulate my own operations/equations.
Gingfacekillah,"""shin sees the flb as an asymmetric selection problem stemming from the presence of [sharps] who possess superior information. because of the presence of [sharps] books engineer a flb in order to pass the costs of losses arising from [sharp action] on to less informed bettors."""
Gingfacekillah,"recency weighting appears to be an important factor when modelling games. too much emphasis on the recent past skews the results but so does too little. a model must identify an accurate ""true mean"" but also self-adjust quickly enough from game to game to uncover value."
logan_matthews9,"lanto: talked about him last week but on him now. very consistent in the winds last time out im buying.

logan_matthews9,its not assumption - look at the top players who have left mls in the past few seasons. almiron tyler adams alphonso davies yedlin miazga jack harrison even go back to defoe geoff cameron. these guys made moves to mid-table and higher clubs in the epl/bundesliga

adamchernoff,pardon the hijacking of post. when you lifted your ham off of the grill on thanksgiving what adjective would you use to describe the texture of it? im hours in and have a jello-ish boob like heft. trying to decide on when to drop the glaze...
adamchernoff,hey david that sounds amazing. an australia trip is long over due! a lot of great folks down there and ive never heard anyone say a single bad word about going for a visit. will let you know for sure. going to send a dm shortly.
adamchernoff,spot on. lv has been working and perfecting the land based model for more than 40 years. that is really the base of my gripe with what i experienced in nj. the blueprint is there for all the emerging companies to follow but they are not.

adamchernoff,"in designing a gambling product experience location shop - anything - there are three main points that everything must revolve around.

speed
isolation

you will never ever find a gambling product that is successful which does not hit all three of these out of park."
adamchernoff,not sure if it was mentioned but rot numbers were created for casinos to speed up transactions at tellers and also for ease of training. in my experience its difficult to expect entry level tellers to know 500+ teams interpret bettors requests and create tickets quickly.
adamchernoff,i tried combining different stats numbers injury values individual player numbers and situations which took me way out of my depth and i think led to more inaccurate pricing and overfitting than it did provide any benefit or profit. i scrapped them and started to focus...
adamchernoff,sounds fantastic. i tried the bath yesterday. before wrapping i put butter honey pineapple and some rub into the magic bullet then poured it on. found it worked quite well. no stick/burn like sometimes happens with butter/sugar in the wrap if the temp creeps above 300.
adamchernoff,a sports betting market is the reflection of information and opinions (wagers). for example if in a very hypothetical scenario if 100 bettors had 100 pieces of information available to them over the course of betting a market 'should' adjust to reflect the info and wagers.
adamchernoff,"you read 60000 words of football stuff on a plane? did you fly from australia?

ToddFuhrman,georgia is a moot point in this discussion compared to bama; they win out they're getting in but losing at home to south carolina isn't a good look.  you mean that same irish team that was drummed by michigan and slipped by a mediocre vt side?
ToddFuhrman,"every time you lose a bet it creates an opportunity to learn.

whether  it is  identifying something useful about a player coach team market entry money management etc turn the negative into a positive and make yourself better rather than blaming external factors for the defeat"
ToddFuhrman,ha trust me its all about the long term in this game. any bettor that says he or she never has a losing day week or even a month is lying to you. we have to let  have his moment in the sun he earned it
12Xpert,of course you could show my sample is unrepresentative by publishing data from your own representative sample but somehow i suspect it won't be forthcoming. in fact my sample exhibits a weaker power distribution than the bwin data which presumably is population data but hey ho
12Xpert,that is probably true to a point. but if a book sees a punter taking prices that are best in market and then close shorter  it is  an immediate warning. compounded if they have information shared from other books that they have already restricted the customer.
12Xpert,for those who are too good for the recreational bookmakers there are always the exchanges. if you are unable to show profitable expected value at exchanges then the value you thought you had at bookmakers was simply because of their charity (in offering loss leading prices).
12Xpert,the  could write another article explaining the difference between recreational bookmaker and market maker bookmaker models. the latter is much harder to make work in a high tax regime which is why uk and euro bookmakers follow the former.  it is  not illegal to do so.
12Xpert,"daily fantasy sports  ask me ask them.

for what  it is  worth if you want better social care higher personal tax and national insurance allowances a properly funded nhs and free tv licences you either borrow more or you tax more or both.  that is  how."
12Xpert,if they win that narrative endlessly plugged by the opposition parties will be tested. i'm not fully convinced by it. boris' voting record on social issues is historically quite positive but people have more recently focused on the silly things he has said. time will tell.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  care if they are fucking gods. the fact that the top 20 could print money (assuming they could  might say otherwise) doesn't change the hypothesis that betting performances look very similar to a random distribution if the other 10000 are tossing coins.
12Xpert,yours is a much smaller sample and no futures events (might make a difference). i agree that log method always seems to lead to positive yields for 2-way markets (so probably over estimating strength of f-l bias) but in my sample other methods were bigger negatives.
12Xpert,maybe the puppet masters of the eu projects see the eu as a means of expanding the concept of nation to something bigger and a natural progression from tribe  chiefdom  village  town  city  nation and beyond as globalism drives the collective psyche to ever bigger in-groups.
12Xpert,"economists are notoriously bad at estimating error bounds. they are just human beings so  it is  hardly surprising and not their fault. but then lets not raise them up to the status of ""expert"".  it is  pretty much like me saying i'm an expert at roulette."
12Xpert,he's making no attempt to show how likely his record can happen by chance assuming his model does nothing. he makes no attempt to show whether it beats closing prices. indeed he even argues closing prices are completely irrelevant. this is not someone who's statistically savvy.
12Xpert,the reason he campaigned for remain is because labour wouldnt keep him as leader if he campaigned for leave. he prioritises the end of the tories above brexit hence his fencing sitting and ambivalence as a management strategy to prevent tom watson from growing a spine.
12Xpert,as a bayesian i'm inclined to ascribe a higher probability to the second of these opinions until such time as data becomes available to suggest that the first is much more likely proving that bookies were actually doing that rather than this being just anecdotal hearsay.
12Xpert,marco blume head of trading has said some things that point to a general business model but they  daily fantasy sports  reveal specifics like how many of their customers beat the closing line by more than the margin and how well that correlates with actual rois.
12Xpert,this is when  it is  appropriate: . your follow up results (a posteriori) are -4.5 percent  from 22772 bets and 153 systems. 91 of them are loss making the average t-score is -0.32). your systems are regressing to the mean because they are based on nothing.

mschwimer,i genuinely believe the astros aaa/aa combo team would not finish dead last  in the mlb if they were the 31st team in baseball. brought this up to a front office exec who said he thought they would finish better than marlins os and tigers. #astrodepth
mschwimer,i want everyone to be able to get legit advice. current subscription services dont have the same incentives as their customers. if we ever did do a subscription service i would make sure our financial incentives were in complete alignment. which has never been done before.
mschwimer,i havent. just started doing it this year. my career started on december 8th 2018. from then until now  has made 1611 recommendations and is up 190.48 units. so if you bet $100 on all our games you would be up almost 20k in 5 months.
RufusPeabody,added game  college basketball  totals have $250 limits. not hard to move those. i dont know if they are or arent moving lines. i just know mike thought somehow they could give out picks that had value without influencing prices which doesnt make logical sense
RufusPeabody,the tout industry will always be a scourge on the betting ecosystem. but i would like to try to move the needle towards more transparency. if more touts essentially bet on themselves winning i'd hope it would increase pressure on other's to do the same.
RufusPeabody,psa: just because someone posts a winning betting ticket does not mean its their own. some of these touts try to pass off other peoples legit winning tickets as their own. and everyone please stay away from this  guy. im reporting copyright infringement to twitter
SportsCheetah,if youve watched it all year and havent learned something new or used any information you get to better your betting process then we failed. claiming youre fading people that are .500 and crushing it isnt real though unless your guy is offering you +110.
SportsCheetah,now that said they are still the hornets and they still will be a bottom-feeder in the east. but game-to-game they may continue to outperform priors for the early start of the season and are likely a better team than i had projected going in.
SportsCheetah,chicago attempted 17 more  field goal s than charlotte and took 6 more fts. i'll see if we can dig up what percentage of the time a team with at least 17 more  field goal  attempts and 6 free throw attempts in a game loses.
capjack2000,"second he was playing poker. a player-banked game. he was gambling against other patrons at the table not against the house. i'd argue poker isn't even gambling. he won about $240 at poker over two 6 hour sessions.

capjack2000,"tn not having existing casinos is another big reason why our input is important. the usual bullies aren't on this block. 

you can bet the european companies have hired slick lobbyists to get their agenda approved...but at least there aren't existing stakeholders in the state."

capjack2000,"cant say im surprised we see it time and again. kambi will tell you the book sets how much margin they want. 

im guessing kambi suggests (scares) books into choosing the highest margin on their weekly calls. then the public backlash forces books to normalize."
capjack2000,"that is  not the point. personally i  daily fantasy sports  have a problem with books refunding wagers for whatever reason they want. 

but how plusev is going about this is just asking for trouble. there's a whole lotta jersey in spanky and...well...he's poking the bear."
capjack2000,"it is  infographic time!

if you want to see the potential damage of letting vendors run rampant over a jurisdiction. take a look at pennsylvania:

in a year or so this is how pa will look broken down by physical sportsbook. looks pretty competitive right?"
capjack2000,"exactly. if you're a recreational (or sharp) bettor the first step is to come to terms that beating the nfl is near impossible. 

next step is to trim the house edge as much as possible.

capjack2000,now that penn is skin-happy it seems like they would be in favor of spinning up the license in cherry hill. the move to the defendants being called strictly greenwood makes me wonder if the pennwood joint venture is fracturing (further than it already has).

ClevTA,i think u are confusing the two late possessions. it wasnt the first one it was the 2nd one where the browns failed. when it was 7-6 and its 3rd and 10 from their own 25. u have to run there after two straight incompletions
ClevTA,trust me im not saying giants are winning but just pointing out why the line isnt above 7. u cant lay that many points against any team on the road if u are the worst defense or towards the bottom is really the main point
ClevTA,wrote about it here but the only legit qbs dallas has faced is rodgers and cousins. ill count darnold in a loss too but against rodgers and cousins both adams and thielen were out and they still lost both at home. brady should have success
ClevTA,not sure these are comparable discussion points when theres usually a big nfl learning curve and salary cap implications with replacing a highly drafted qb vs just evaluating a college qb in the draft. not saying right or wrong but there are diff decision factors
ClevTA,huh? browns were -2.5 point favorites at the time of the tweet and i was wondering why they werent -4. the game closed -4. i was wrong about allen not having a chance but i got the spread right which is what i tweeted about
ClevTA,u realize the main reason sea goes 3 and out is bc schotty is ultra conservative right? sea is top 5 in success rate in 2m offense. i apologize if the 2 percent  league wide rate in 700+ drives wasnt enough of a sample size
ClevTA,luckily there is actual context. and i watched the gm live and the full replay. the ol wasnt great but it wasnt awful like some are suggesting. it was adequate enough to succeed. playcalling + holding the ball too long hurt as much as ol
CizzlingSports,do not forget context. mike mike thumped his chest that this report proves that jambos is untouchable. whether  it is  technically an audit attestation review etc. doesn't really matter. what matters is if it does what mike mike claimed which it plainly does not imo.

spanky,i make millions of dollars cuz i make people millions of dollars.  if he was so good why wouldnt he just bet and make the money himself?  if you resort to taking money from bettors youre obviously not able to take money from bookmakers. period.
spanky,i disagree here. a mexican drug cartel offers an inferior product. offshore sports books have 1.) experience handing all kinds of players 2.) have  the best oddsmakers and 3.) have far superior technology. thy are far better equipped booking us sports than any european company.
spanky,thanks billy. bookmaking is defined as accepting bets from members of the public as a business.... i never accepted bets from anyone.  either way judge accepted my plea to end the case which lasted two years. i had several attorneys including professor i nelson rose
spanky,while i agree the bet shouldnt be paid i also dont blame him for refusing the offer.  the generosity rating of tickets and $500 is subjective and we should have no room for subjectivity.  some written rule should be in place to protect all parties.

DocBettor,theres a viable middle ground e.g. 1-3 unit system and posting units with your official records. no one on #gamblingtwitters going to fully trust you or any tout from the start but theres a path to distinguishing yourself by maintaining transparency and keeping your word.

PlusEVAnalytics,so seriously guys how do we save the planet? activism gets headlines but changes nothing. regulation is ineffective when 200 countries share the same environment. the oceans are filling up with plastic trash. climate change is a huge unknown and its all downside. now what?
PlusEVAnalytics,you cant bring toothpaste on board because were afraid youll use it as a weapon. also your cell phone could interfere with navigation so well ask you nicely to pretty please turn it to airplane mode and not care if you actually do. makes sense?
PlusEVAnalytics,power imbalances that existed for factory workers in 1930 dont exist for bloggers in 2019. they can unionize but protections should be symmetrical - if i cant fire you for being bad at your job you cant quit because a competitor offered you more money.
PlusEVAnalytics,that article tests for one specific signal (favourite/longshot) and doesnt find it. thats great but it in no way proves that the market is efficient. i dont think its even possible to verify that a market is efficient it would be like proving a negative.
aluckyaday,i think this is the difference between the uk and spain maybe  can confirm this. in spanish law they are not allowed to discriminate in this way but each case has to go to court for a judge decide if discrimination has actually taken place.
aluckyaday,"the problem is spanky with the tech available today we all can be ""top chefs"". beating books by line shopping is childsplay any old bot can do it. and if you can't do it yourself you can rent a bot to do it for you..."
aluckyaday,you say that but what is important is the edge after vig which can be bigger in prop markets. the issue with betting with an edge in any softbook market is they will close you down and sharp books offer a lot less prop markets!
aluckyaday,hope i'm wrong but i doubt they will be anything but a glorified advert for sports betting. from a european point of view where we have seen the effect that gambling advertising has on vulnerable people i would think this is a very bad idea.
aluckyaday,they do accas for the same reasons bigger payoffs bigger rush. in an acca the vig on each is compounded so they pay more that way. i think matthew trenhaile mentioned in one of his podcasts that the cut for average recreational is about 3/1
aluckyaday,restrictions are nothing to do with bookmakers confidence. they are the most profitable way to operate in a recreational market. big bets are not the issue. adverse selection is. however much you moan it is not going to change. recreational books  for recreationals players only!
aluckyaday,i guess we will never see a breakdown of which staking levels their profits come from. i would think it is a very different profile for bm vs online/apps. if oregon publish the tax from the big winning bets we would get an idea .
aluckyaday,i guess the eu are acting on the behalf of the irish. its a big test for them. to show that the big countries will support the smaller ones. from the eu perspective if the irish are not happy with any deal it wont happen.
aluckyaday,"they did not say as you did ""anyone can get addicted to gambling its inherently addictive"". i really would like to see the peer reviewed evidence of this. as this seems to be the basis of your campaign you can show me the scientific evidence?"
aluckyaday,you are missing the point. the numbers are never going to get to a point where liquidity matches financial markets. the incentives to gamble (its zero sum less costs) are not the same as the need to convert long term debt to short term liquidity.
aluckyaday,i believe a cross party committee recommended that the 8th be revealed before the referendum was announced. they also drafted the new laws that defined exactly under what circumstances abortion would be allowed before the vote. if only the uk parliament had been so sensible!
aluckyaday,some people can not be taught! but apart from that individuals  daily fantasy sports  have the time to study and understand the implications and can be misled by biases in the media. that is why a representative democracy works much better than a direct one.
aluckyaday,with gary's bet? if that is the case they i would stick to place betting his selections. depends how much the dopamine hit of a big price winner is worth. i guess for a lot of people that is as important as the monetary returns!
aluckyaday,you have to remember simon that if they had to accept every customer prices would be very different. as most customers are losers forcing them to accept bets from everybody would be detrimental to the majority of players. there are 2 sides to every argument.
aluckyaday,there are a few of these sites already. remember europe as been at this game for a very long time! one of the biggest is  all selections verified against pinnacle prices. the problem of survivorship bias still exists in supermarkets though because losers stop tipping.
aluckyaday,yeah. the consistent time before ko overrides my first point . what i was trying to say is that closing prices aside joseph's data is a snapshot. so it is likely that the different kickoff times will have different margins when the snapshot is taken.

joeytunes2,"few nj apps have cut me severely bc i'm ""non recreational"" so i might not lose basically. in reality i walked away winner when in hindsight. they would have made money back the last month or so. i might have some more stories to come."
EdMillerPoker,i just think politics is 90 percent  people demanding more for themselves and people like them. dont think theres anything to be discounted about that. im just amused by all the mental gymnastics people go through to dress up that naked self-interest as anything else.

GolcondaFund,"""regardless of the findings"" demonstrates your pandering to partisanship not integrity with truth.

intellectual dishonesty is conflating one side of an argument to negate with impunity the other side.

GolcondaFund,"just like a bad pre-season game wouldn't dump on too soon.

nonrandomalpha,watching tua pick apart inferior competition with an elite all-sec supporting cast is not sufficient evidence to project hes the next andrew luck. odds are that hes not and will be a significant work in progress and surely not worth throwing away an entire season.
nonrandomalpha,also better in the sense that they do have well known handicappers that provide breakdowns and rationales - not that they produce winning picks...i honestly have no idea whether they do or not in aggregate - but its likely not - bc who does? except
LeeSharpeNFL,"for the most part positions are far more loosely defined in other sports compared to football.

the difference in what they do is much larger between a left tackle and a defensive back in football compared to say a forward and a guard in basketball."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""our first priority was the defensive line.""

ah the half of the ball that matters less and the less important part of that half.

 it is  not like russell wilson was there when carroll came in. carroll started in 2010 wilson was drafted in 2012."
LeeSharpeNFL,honestly the weirdest thing about this is that normally  it is  the black qbs whose talents are dismissed as products of situation and the white qbs who are assumed to be highly talented and the pleasant surprise of this is that  it is  the reverse.
LeeSharpeNFL,do you believe some players are better/worse at mentally handling the increased stakes of a playoff game vs. the regular season and that this would show up in their on-field production even after adjusting for the higher quality of opponent you expected in the playoffs?
LeeSharpeNFL,and aside from the error bars being large and overlapping this only analyzes rbs *as they affect the run game* (because  it is  from the big data bowl) but most analytical attempts to rank rbs are looking at their impact to the passing game primarily.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""everytime there's a kickoff return or a defender around the ball there's this hunger for the touchdown because you know  it is  the only way.  that is  a familiar place to me.""

this is very real. nobody expresses the bears fan experience as well as"
LeeSharpeNFL,"me: i'm a bears fan and i bet on them this week. wins are good and fun.

also me: trubisky being humiliated on a national stage seems important because i worry  it is  necessary for pace to finally accept that his draft selection was bad."
AndyMSFW,mostly high intensity pressure from  to get into the first round leader market.  but jordan met a couple criteria for me including price and the stuff you just mentioned.  now that you bring it up i'll be pretty mad if he wins the whole thing.
AndyMSFW,might be the end of the road for ncaa plays this year.  i'll keep running the numbers on any games that pop up over the next couple weeks and post anything that i find value in but nothing has hit the triggers for this week.
AndyMSFW,"recap: uncw lost by a lot 0-1 on the only play.

JoeyKnish22,will be in jersey for  #2 on 1/26. should be a good time and a great industry networking event. some great prizes couple sharp guys on the panel with me and ill probably be breaking down what color the super bowl gatorade is gonna be.
JoeyKnish22,another really good podcast from phil. the crowd this guy runs with not a huge fan of a recent uncle knish post (lol) but some excellent info in here. enjoyed it. very few ppl know how things actually work in sports betting. these guys do.
JoeyKnish22,this content not only worth a laugh. but this is a great pic to show you how easy it is to photoshop tickets. like the one crypto loser who photo shopped him betting 25k on the hot dog contest at dimes a few years ago.
JoeyKnish22,lol no its the knish invitational now. lindeman is hiding behind a counter somewhere praying i dont walk in. pick side and total for every game. 80 picks total. no key picks either. eliminates any confusion. we wanted as simple as possible (people are dumb)
JoeyKnish22,i havent done a great job of hyping this up. mostly because frank sucks at twitter. and providing record updates. but after a big cheetah comeback we got a photo finish in the wnba contest. if you invested in this at knishypph heres the latest.
JoeyKnish22,i havent personally written anything but i would agree its not easily quantifiable will mostly be unique to each person. im fine with 4-12 month holds in most cases if the edge is there. longer the hold the more edge id want in return etc.
TheKostos,i'm a chelsea fan but can't make a case for the blues today. bayern should be rampant. no kante is a big problem. stamford bridge form has been inconsistent/poor all season.  daily fantasy sports  care about beating spurs without kane/son this wknd. bayern/lewandowski different beast.
LockyLockerson,"lastly ""talent score"" was a basic metric introduced in the guide and it did pretty well in identifying teams that could have top-performing seasons.  your 4 playoff teams this year with talent score entering the year: lsu (1st) ohio state (7th) oklahoma (8th) clemson (11th)"
LockyLockerson,"i  daily fantasy sports  know why this amuses me.  washington-miami next week  they're a combined 0-9.  but!

miami has lost by less with each passing week (49/43/25/20)

washington has lost by more each passing week (5/10/16/21/26)

2 teams going in the same direction...at different speeds."
LockyLockerson,"thinking about making ""leans galore"" the title of my next project.  by the way if you did bet these first off you're a true degenerate and i love you.  but also be prepared to sweat all 3 because yikes.  

picks coming in a little bit."
LockyLockerson,just when i thought i was done the market just went to kc -4 over cincy in the first game.  too many points alert!  now we'll have a position on all 3 games.  cincy +4 to win 1x and cincy +166 for 1 more.  fin.
DannyParkins,amazing that my cousin david kaplans movie short term 12 gets this kind of recognition. he produced it and is mentioned in here and has done a ton of other things but this film is my favorite work of his hes done to this point.
DannyParkins,incase you missed it  me and my man  (one of the most under utilized people in chicago media btw) choppin it up for 75 minutes on my career path radio philosophies mini-controversies gambling and a whole lot more. tune in if you have the time:
DannyParkins,of course it did and it was great but im saying media has changed man everything is getting splintered and smaller. the cubs arent some special outlier that can do it the old way. also again theres no superstation available to them for all games.
DannyParkins,"have people seen the nfl offseason hypothetical on the front page of espn from  for the bears?
step 1: sign tom brady 4 year/$110 million
step 2: trade leonard floyd to giants for 6th round pick
step 3: trade trubisky to dolphins for josh rosen"
DannyParkins,the final word on  with  and  starts 1 hour from now. as the kids say get your popcorn ready. or set your dvr. i dunno what they say just please watch and try to comment on something other than my ravishing good looks for once.
chadmillman,why is that bad? digital media started w/bad model 20+  years ago chasing p-views w/diminishing returns since. users get clickbait lowest-common-denominator content  same stories that drive traffic. we want to play a more sustainable game. give it a try tell me if its worth it.
Gingfacekillah,it is  a good question. ultimately i'm not sure the paper tells us much  that is  new. as  mentioned  it is  really just speaking to aggregate market efficiency. that secondary bit about comparing expected to actual opinion as you mentioned was kind of interesting though.
Gingfacekillah,i picked up 4x16gb. it purrs on 2x16 in slots 2  4 but i get bsod when i run all 4 sticks. have turned axmp on/off adjusted ram timings hasn't quite worked out yet. i'll keep trying or worst case just run 2x16gb i guess.
Gingfacekillah,here's a supplemental visual guide for the mlb expected pitcher k's prop discussed in this podcast. this is a basic version with regression coefficients taken from fangraphs. this can be improved considerably but  that is  for you to discover on your own. happy edge hunting.

Gingfacekillah,"that is  a good question. a live betting line changing is generally a function of time winding down and new game state information. best you can do is compare to a model and forecast an expected value. no ""closing line"" in that scenario per se."
Gingfacekillah,thanks! win or lose  it is  very difficult. anyone who says otherwise is being disingenuous. especially with modelling - which is why many sharp bettors employ line grinding steam chasing etc. hopefully the book is able to point readers a step in right direction :)
Gingfacekillah,valid concerns. there are solutions to every problem though. many of the most useful stats are derivative stats in the nba rather than raw stats. most raw nba stats are descriptive rather than predictive which is why they produce such poor results on their own.
Gingfacekillah,that is the prevailing thought. if you use a weaker method of vig removal it could mislead you into thinking otherwise. many research papers use the equal split method and as such their evidence for or against certain market biases might need a second look.
Gingfacekillah,"very cool. most team s percent  regresses to around 10ish percent over a season so should a shot be worth 0.10? then focus on expected shots for and against using distribution fitting?

(xshots) * (xs percent  (+/- opponent xsv percent  differential from avg)= base xg?"
Gingfacekillah,"the most insidious part of this: ""feel intimidated"". this is the default strategy in schools and places of work - totally harmless words and phrases are construed to have made people ""feel unsafe"" and once you use that language harassment policy kicks in. absolutely terrifying."
logan_matthews9,ive argued with a lot of people today on this point - but this is it for me. we cant blame gb for trying things when he had five matches before naming his gold cup roster (and only two where he could call in everyone)

adamchernoff,"are a new bettor and wish to improve you will begin seeking for information (likely on google) and enter an info cycle that focuses on:

Ccon8181,so much spread drama with #virginia for those who had 14 14.5 early. glad they covered everything and we didnt have to suffer that ref debacle late with +15.5 taking away that touchdown away was pure garbage. but it gets there. good shit #cavaliers #orangebowl
Ccon8181,#msu in deep last two possessions and two turnovers up 6. if we had patented dantonio hed have run 3 times and settled for  field goal  like he did in regular season. they better buck up on defense. but i can see it coming. #msuvswf
Ccon8181,i reasoned it was worse for multiple reasons including but not limited to rogers. more so the vikings o-line and their inability to run making the 4th down play call predictable. run your model if adams makes that wide open catch with 2+ minutes left.

dude that bought this ticket for 4500 should have bet the buckeyes on his own at +275 and it would have paid significantly better than the 1.9x he's getting on his money"
ToddFuhrman,not at all still a lot to unpack just fascinating to see market sentiment towards a team that everyone ran to back last week at chicago.  nobody wanted the rams vs seattle either  it is  all about what have you done for me lately league
ToddFuhrman,no doubt about it; if the public lost every bet they wouldn't continue to gamble.  it always entertains me that people expect you to be right 90 percent  of the time and if you lose a prime time game should be grounds for industry ex-communication
ToddFuhrman,not at all so much of what's done is numbers based and the ravens market value had peaked a bit.  i was on the rams and own the loss but clearly a match-up they weren't ready for so i take the l and move forward
ToddFuhrman,well here's the issue that i always have...vegas power numbers are based on predictive and proactive numbers whereas the media polls are all about results and not indicative of future success ( that is  about as deep as i can get on a saturday btw)
ToddFuhrman,"i dont think this has anything to do with fromm honestly more his guys cant get open downfield. its allowing every opposing dc to key on the ground game making things extremely difficult on jake

however fields legs would be a welcomr element no doubt"

12Xpert,as always a little bit of transparancy from both sides of the argument would work wonders in explaining the status quo with respect to sports betting in the uk instead of denials from bookmakers and moral attacks on high earning ceos from those against gambling.
12Xpert,i imagine length of managerial tenure is quasi-pareto distributed and hence doing a simple linear regression like i did is not the appropriate method to form valid conclusions. however i still suspect that however we do it we'll still find them agreeing with our intuition.
12Xpert,if  it is  only faith you're bothered about then i'm told astrology and alchemy are worth following. taleb would probably add economists to that. religion is also worth a look. i believe john chapter 20 verse 27 has some things to say on the subject.
12Xpert,dopamine  serotonin. people get comfort in feeling in control (e.g. by predicting the future) even if that is all illusory which for almost everyone in betting/poker/financial day trading it is. similar to placebo. even when people told  it is  placebo they still take the pills.
12Xpert,...because the establishment calling voters stupid will always be ok they face no risk. leave voters face big risks. the majority are socioeconomically poorer and working class and will more readily live and die by their decisions. they arent going to pay attention to an...
12Xpert,"what does boom! mean then? ""shit look how lucky i've been""?

also your numbers on bk  daily fantasy sports  add up. it says 263 tips but the monthly totals add up to 193 for a loss of -74.3 not a profit of 44.6. how come?"
12Xpert,we live in an age of polarised truths: religious political moral environmental. ive always found this kind of absolutism obscene. am i being absolutist in my intolerance to intolerance? perhaps. but im not so arrogant to assume that i know the truth about complex systems.
12Xpert,were currently moving into the anti gambling phase of the cycle that sees moral attitudes to gambling flip flop. winners are simply seen as collateral damage in the same way that bookmaker employees are. if they have to suffer its the lesser of two evils.
12Xpert,when asking why we do things i think you always have to start by taking the evolutionary perspective: why does a behaviour exist? most likely  it is  a winning strategy otherwise it would have already died out. what about it made it a winning strategy?
12Xpert,these things are easily solvable. if you tip have yourself verified independently. if you won't customers should always look elsewhere. i've been writing about this stuff for 10 years and more. still there are punters desperate to win easy  that is  why unverified tipsters exist.
12Xpert,i would suggest that a problem behaviour would mean any behaviour that one felt compelled to engage in to relieve a craving but which ultimately fails to relieve the craving thus requiring further repetition of that behaviour and is harmful to one's general well being.
12Xpert,nice. but remember that when recreationals are offering lines that diverge from pinnacles by more than the effective margin it will be pinnacle that is on the right side and eventually the recreationals will close your accounts unless you take steps to disguise your activity.
12Xpert,actually i can do it.  offer opening odds for free so just give me a bit of time to get round to this. i think you're right it could be a useful exercise but i'm still sure pinny is going to come out ahead here.

mschwimer,depends how you look at it. i started daily wager in march.  jambos from when i started daily wager to now is +35.18 units.  also at daily wager i mostly talk mlb and nfl which are the best sports for jambos results as of now.
mschwimer,for clarification in high school my friends always joked with me because they thought i wanted to be the king of the world.  as i am sure you know rex mundi is latin for king of the world.  i do not know about the comics.
mschwimer,yes. but thats not a flaw in my eyes. i know it sounds crazy but i genuinely do not care how many subscribe. i just want to provide a fully transparent and financially accountable option in a space that is littered with thieves and liars.
mschwimer,appreciate it. ive known a lot of gamblers that base their decisions on against the spread trends. not won is a lifetime winner. only lifetime winners i know are people with models or inside information. not saying its not possible. i just dont know any.
RufusPeabody,on the off chance these are helpful i'm making available my senior thesis on psychological inefficiencies in the baseball betting market (from 2008) as well as the lit review on sports betting i wrote in the summer of 2007 (which is probably more useful)
RufusPeabody,(thread) is there more randomness in my baseball betting than i would expect from independent events? i.e. is there autocorrelation in my results? are my results on marlins bets all independent events or is there a factor driving the results of all of them.
RufusPeabody,i wouldn't say that necessarily since james has been so logical with his approach. but then again she hadn't seen his run. she made the safe defensible play. the psychological cost of losing the way your mom's friend did has to be higher right?
SportsCheetah,the good part about dabo going out of his way to run it up there was that he only got 6/7ths of the points for his margin of victory boost or whatever when they missed the pat. it made me laugh for some reason.

spanky,dge is so out of touch with reality.  if transparency is so important why dont they force every licensed bookmaker in the state of nj to admit that the odds they offer are originated by these same unlicensed offshore sports books they are shunning.
spanky,"thanks for the kind words   i stood on the shoulders of legends and probably have had more success than most. 

that being said there are giants (particularly in the soccer and horse racing world) that a guy like me couldnt hold a candle to."
spanky,im the opposite. after being in france for almost a month i promise you usa is the best. i also love jersey and would never leave. i love my religion (roman catholic) and would never change. i dont have dogs but maybe one day
spanky,offensive pi vs. defensive pi. block vs. offensive foul.  all are referees subjective calls that many times can go either way.  shot after the buzzer is purely objective and despite being meaningless to game outcome should be made right 100 out of 100 times...
spanky,i heard about that fezzik guy winning a contest several years ago.   i dont care about contests and i dont care about records.  i dont even know the other guys you mentioned.  who bets enough to move the number and beat the closing number.
spanky,not gonna doubt you. but for me the volume isint there in mma. the vast amount of college basketball games is a sharp bettors dream since any edge is realized short term.  the bank of spank was built on the shoulders of college basketball

PlusEVAnalytics,yeah thats the piece of this that holds together the least for me. there are much better ways to accomplish that objective. and why would sports teams hire him on the basis that he can win at betting why would they care about that?
PlusEVAnalytics,3:  repeatedly made the argument that paying for picks is a good shortcut for people who dont have the time or ability to do their own research.thats false.the more efficient the marketthe less valuable any research is. and youve bought yourself two new problems
aluckyaday,possibly. but there are advertising laws that should cover that. any pro that moans about restrictions without explaining why they exist and how that benefits most punters loses respect in my book. moan about them targeting vulnerable people by all means but not restrictions..
aluckyaday,i'm not taking about bit player casinos. i'm talking about global financial institutions. which some people seem to think are suddenly going to enter the market. as for nevada casinos expanding anywhere why are they not taking on the europeans in their own country?
aluckyaday,i stopped doing them because i lost my feed of current 365 prices. at the moment i'm just testing my new feed that is why i'm putting them up here rather than the website. woc does not work if prices are out of date
aluckyaday,this is going to be an interesting one for the e-wallets. do they risk being banned from gambling transactions?  daily fantasy sports  think it is a solution though as a problem gambler could always transfer from a credit card to their bank account first.
aluckyaday,i think people are misunderstanding why sports and financial  markets exist. the sole purpose of sports markets is speculation. that is not the prime purpose of financial markets speculation is just a by product they are completely different beasts and comparisons are imho silly
aluckyaday,"""accumulative bets involving different contingencies within the same event are not accepted where the outcome of one affects the other. in the event of any such bet being inadvertently accepted settlement will be in accordance with rule 8 general betting rules fair deal rules"""
aluckyaday,so you believe restricting people who show closing line value or bet off market arbable prices is a bad strategy? better than coin flipping losing betters are not net profitable when using a high cost model based on extensive marketing and loss leading prices.
aluckyaday,"and under uk law those referendum are not allowed to be binding on the government only advisory. parliamentary sovereignty is the basis of the uk's ""unwritten"" constitution and nothing can supersede it. the will of the people can only be achieved through their mps."
aluckyaday,only the bits relevant to my own disputes with operators and discussions with the gambling commission. to be honest they have been mainly to do with licence conditions rather than the gambling act. i guess you believe section 1 (c) is not being applied?
aluckyaday,actual profits are all well and good but they can be very misleading. especially if drilling down reducing sample size. do you provide any significance statistics along with the actual return? p-values would help but then i guess most wont know what they are!
aluckyaday,exactly. they have models that are better than the market because they get to test them against everyone else. that allows them to set individual lines to maximise their profits rather than lines that are individually efficient. a books objective is different to bettors!
aluckyaday,referendums have no place in a representative democracy! it is their job to do what they believe is in the best interests of their constituents. i believe a ge is the only solution but that probably won't produce a parliamentary majority for anything either!
aluckyaday,"run of consecutive losing months = 5 with a total loss of 396 points. 
run of consecutive winning months = 6 with a total profit of 2097 points.
biggest loss over 12 consecutive months -237 points
biggest profit  over 12 consecutive months 2779 points"
aluckyaday,to maximize profits books target recreational biases. to do that they often have to offer value on the other side of the bet. if they can restrict sharps from taking the value side of the bet it creates a bigger +ev for the book.
theFirmAISports,haha i appreciate the feedback! whats great about knowing how to program well is that this chart was very quick to produce. i agree that cumulative travel over the season isnt very useful but diving into specific stretches (like weeks 4-9 for us) is.
joeytunes2,this is the most incorrect statement of the year. no pro bets 100 bets a year. we are so limited. if i bet 10k on 100 games and hit 56 percent .? you think  that is  a pro?  we need to find more edges.
joeyisaks,il bet you as much as you want to bet its not a decision. sure its a decision not to fake being straight when you are born gay. but thats a terrible way for people like you do i want other people to live
EdMillerPoker,"hey yall tomorrow is the kidney walk at unlv. my son was diagnosed this year with a serious chronic kidney disease likely to eventually require a transplant.

i would appreciate it if you could throw in a few $ for the national kidney foundation."
EdMillerPoker,"they're all different alternative spreads. fair spread is the ""normal"" spread where the bet is priced about 50/50 on each side.

pick'em line is set to the current lead as pointspread. so if texans are ahead 14-3 currently  it is  set to texans -11."
EdMillerPoker,"my honest but ill admit clumsily diplomatic answer.

every book in nevada offers something a little different to the bettor. some are better for some things and some for others. i wouldnt take their reputations on twitter too seriously id try them all out."
EdMillerPoker,"thank you and yes i know this well tho i will say this view is predominant mostly among the uk-based operators and less so among those based here.

i think for various reasons good pricing will be considerably more valuable in the usa markets"
EdMillerPoker,to be honest i'm not sure how much better you can get in just 2 weeks. but i guess if i had to pick one project for 2 weeks i'd try to build push rate and derivative charts for the sport of your choice.
EdMillerPoker,the in-play streaming thing is the killer app. other differentiator is bet365 will do in house what others will outsource. that cuts both ways. i  daily fantasy sports  think bet365 is a favorite to have the class infrastructure in us but maybe i'm naive.
EdMillerPoker,step 6. write limitlessly by applying this philosophy to nearly any topic of human interest. cast each topic as a battle between evil (represented by the people in step 1 now also classically unvirtuous by implication) and good (represented by adherence to your philosophy).
EdMillerPoker,not saying this is whats going on here but a certain media property has staked a good bit of its rep on the fade the public angle and it will be in every other media propertys interest from now on to debunk said angle
EdMillerPoker,they deleted the tweet. this is what frustrates me most about how the media companies behave nowadays. they write an incendiary misleading clickbait headline and reap the rewards. then once the fire dies they silently revise or delete the headline to scrub the record
GolcondaFund,"tebow though obviously not as good got a more raw deal and he won a playoff game and never started a season as the starter nor did he get a bye and he played #1 d in playoffs.

LeeSharpeNFL,"did anyone say ""wow kyle shanahan should probably get fired?"" in 2018 after the 49ers lost jimmy g early in the season and went 4-12? no of course not. why is frank reich any different?

and luck is a lot better than jimmy g."
LeeSharpeNFL,"1) i've added a new value to the play_type field ""note"". this splits off the ""no_play"" rows which represent penalties from the rows (now ""note"") which simply report a quarter change two minute warning timeout etc. with no real game action attached to them."
LeeSharpeNFL,"tl;dr: there's no perfect answer everything is a tradeoff between sample size and relevance. trying to perfect this likely leads to overfitting.

try a few options which make logical sense (e.g. previous season less relevant than current season) and see how predictive it is."
LeeSharpeNFL,the chart i quote tweeted above was starting to look into that (by using early down epa/play as the proxy for team skill) i was trying to see if they correlated. i agree this is the right way i'd like to treat this too.
LeeSharpeNFL,maybe this has just been a definitional argument? i'm analogizing to physics and how i think tv means it: having done well recently raises the expectation for the immediate future that the immediate past carries more weight than its portion of a larger sample.
LeeSharpeNFL,"my teammates and i are 18-25-2 currently in the supercontest. our picks for week 10:

whale_capper,interesting angle but the only problem is colts are expected to do well (bar is relatively high) and if any team truly surprises then that coach will be held in higher regard for coy... happened with nagy last year beating out payton and reid

JoeyKnish22,i used to never watch primary debates or state of the union addresses before political props. but now im all in. never watched so much political tv in my life. so lets sprinkle a few to make tonight a bit more interesting shall we?
JoeyKnish22,been pondering this today. if you had to pick one of these guys to have as your franchise qb. both similar background profiles (midround picks by pats). both traded but with way different perceptions at the time of trade. who you taking going forward?

TheKostos,listening to run the jewels after it was announced theyre touring with rage. anyone remember when espn used their self-titled song as the music bed for the panthers/cardinals ryan lindley shitshow wild card game? lol. such a dope song and such an awful game
LockyLockerson,"so this is absolutely a really cool moment and  it is  awesome for kalin bennett.   let us  celebrate it.  none of that is diminished by my next question...

how would we ever know that he's the first? what kind of weirdo superlative is that?"
LockyLockerson,"it is  that time!

full ratings for all 350+ schools plus full projections for every college basketball game (incl. added games) with analysis at patreon.

if you know college hoops fans tell them to sign up and take advantage of the work we're doing!"
LockyLockerson,"oh yeah there's no question that the number ""makes sense"" from a lot of different standpoints with the loss of talent for stanford being one of them.  i think  it is  just interesting more as a situation we basically never see with this team."
LockyLockerson,"2 charts:

first is an updated form of last week's.  these were heisman prices entering week 1 team total of the team opponent location and then what the price changed to after the game.  not insane correlation but top and bottom pretty damn interesting."
LockyLockerson,kyrie may have 0 prime years left and kd is a total unknown with a pretty low ceiling of prime years left anyway due to age.  so awesome they could pair up to hype and then destroy a franchise after next season and beyond.
EliHershkovich,"discussed san diego state futures (100-1) this week    it is  shortened to 50-1.

aztecs could nab #2 or #3 seed one of the best defenses in the country experienced backcourt rebounding prowess  one of their best shooting teams in years. still some value left."
EliHershkovich,"ha fair enough. point is why is michigan overhyped? odds are higher than osu who's lost more meaningful pieces while u-m's offensive approach has finally changed. there's some value because of it.

if they were roughly the same as georgia's for instance i'd agree."
DannyParkins,ok man. just know there are hardworking people everywhere. people shouldnt be stigmatized negatively because of where they grew up north side south side city burbs. its not that big of a deal. judge on merit work ethic talent etc. have a good day.
DannyParkins,thats true. i started off by saying i dont trust him. i think him going at brooke pryor today is another sign he isnt maturing or taking it seriously. heres the police report detailing physical injuries. i get it that fans are gonna stan.
DannyParkins,sure thatll obviously regress some even though hell be guarded by smaller guys all series but steph and klay balled and no one else got going which makes sense given how good torontos defense is. kawhi only had an inefficient 23. that was legit.
DannyParkins,new trend seems to be top button even when sitting which often shows tie out the bottom. joe buck had it that way during the super bowl. seems odd to me too but thats how they suggested i do it for the final word.
DannyParkins,i did that all football season. 2.5 hours in the morning 4 hours at night. gave up the national show and now do just 30 minutes on the final word on fox32 at night. so morning gambling show and tv at night. gotta grind.
Gingfacekillah,volume 1 deals with a number of generalized models that are broadly applicable to many different sports. in volume 2 the player based approaches are understandably league specific but again there are concepts and applications that you can transfer to any sport you'd like.
Gingfacekillah,the spreadsheet i used for this article is available for you to download as well. you can use it to walk through the article or run your own experiments. contact  through the email provided at the bottom of the article or download it here:
Gingfacekillah,they can be depending on your model configuration. bit of a detour from the point i was getting at but full kelly underestimates the risk of ruin and ignores minimum/maximum bet sizes. i wouldn't recommend that. even quarter kelly can get rather exciting lol
Gingfacekillah,appreciate the vote of confidence! i have a new-found respect for authors - producing a book that is reasonably coherent and succinct is a substantial undertaking. can't say for sure that i'd do it again. my current methods are something i'd rather keep quiet.
Gingfacekillah,ebook updates are now live - please refresh/update your version and you'll have access. fixed a few minor typos and some small issues with the spread sheet models. if you download them from the new link in the updated book everything should run smoothly.
Gingfacekillah,"many people think that the main psychological aspect of handicapping is about revenge factors etc. 

theyre not wrong but of at least equal importance are the cognitive biases of the market itself. which of the two categories do you think are more predictable? explore."
Gingfacekillah,drummond under hits curry assit as well just missed on the last 3. 2-3. a little surprised kerr played curry so long down the stretch but  that is  the way it goes. one bucket less in that last minute and its 5-0 or 4-1.
Gingfacekillah,most academics in this field are vastly more interested in the process than the outcome. thinking for the sake of thinking. many fruitless conversations about sports models at the local statistics faculty have convinced there is a certain antipathy for profit among the tenured.
Gingfacekillah,how much  percent  adjustment is a different goalie worth? ive often wondered whether a goalies stats describe team defence more than individual performance. plus backups are put in at inopportune moments: injuries blowouts back-to-backs. had done some work modelling a team save percent .
Gingfacekillah,head over to  website and you'll find his conveniently made spreadsheet for the logistic proportional and odds ratio methods. the others are explained in the paper linked to above with shin method being ideal you bet a multi-outcome (3+) sport like soccer or horses.
logan_matthews9,"i choose one but basically gave a lot more weight to just raw talent numbers. 

the bigger issue is mid-tournament predictions. as golfers will have played different courses these numbers are almost guaranteed to be off. so my focus will be on pre-tournament bets"
logan_matthews9,yeah thats wrong. nz kept trying to call him up but he wanted to play for the us. and araujo played for the us in the u20 wc as a 17 year old two months ago so he has definitely talked to the federation
logan_matthews9,not that im  but i built two separate models (one xgboost and one glm) used the averages (surprisingly very close to each other) and ran 1000 simulations of the john deere classic. top 5 winners were team nl ryan moore lucas glover and ch3
logan_matthews9,as with any model one of the most important steps is variable selection. theres tons of really great information already published on this. i personally tend to lean towards simpler vs a ton of stuff but i also almost exclusively work with tree models

adamchernoff,youre spot on. unfortunately for the 85 percent  of customers looking at $115 to win $100 instead of $120 to win $100 vs receiving say vs $50 free play is a waste and often considered insulting. often viewed as a much cheaper/worse offer too.
adamchernoff,after reconstructing the box score the question around the opening price two weeks from now get interesting. from the perspective of a majority of bookmakers the 28-25 final was most likely a positive result but from many bettors perspective it was likely quite aggravating...
adamchernoff,here in canada government run sports betting and (regular) lotto operators both revoked the ability to play with credit cards. there was a strong correlation between playing with credit and problem gaming. i suspect the same will occur with this scenario. will be interesting.
adamchernoff,no kidding! i think their best all around game of the season comes this week so he is probably still around for the week 8 game which could be as green of a green light to an over as we have seen this season.
adamchernoff,in my last thread like this () i explained why defining an edge is extremely important and doing so can in turn make bankroll management - and to some degree success - automatic. closing line value is a reflection of ones edge and process.
adamchernoff,"professionals work relentless on defining an edge as the more accurately an edge can be defined the more efficient staking will become. professional bettors tend to ask ""what is the probability of this outcome occurring"" rather than thinking ""i think this team will win""."
adamchernoff,"i have put up a basic mlb model on my website . 

user experience is a bit wacky but for my first time building and publishing something like this i am quite happy with how it turned out. details of the model explained below..."
adamchernoff,no. id never give a minute of my time to a place that priced (or did price - not sure now) nfl sides/totals at 7 percent  margins. not a big fan of tourist retail shops in general. i worked with asurewin and paradise games.
adamchernoff,the simple handicap mindset was built on breaking down bets to the most basic matchups. it is amazing how many bettors try handicap at a high level but pay no attention to the basics and accumulate knowledge. here is how you can change that:
adamchernoff,very much so. short game purist myself. nothing sweeter than walking up to the green dropping the pin on the fringe making the perfect read rolling in a putt dead centre and hearing the sound of the ball hitting the bottom of the cup.
adamchernoff,"a split 1-1 (-0.00x) #nflwildcard weekend for readers of my blog for  

listeners of the podcast give back 1.20x with a loss on the baltimore ravens. overall 1-2 (-1.20x) on the week. two plays away from 2-1 two plays away from 0-3. moving on."
adamchernoff,absolutely. the swings in baseball are massive not dissimilar from cricket which draws the biggest in-play handle. the only issue with baseball is the time decay late. market prices do not tend to hold long. downside on buying out in-play positions is typically large.
adamchernoff,"the simple handicap slack channel has been live for a week. big response from members regarding the format  info.

ToddFuhrman,you  daily fantasy sports  truly remember how bad certain college teams were last year until you finalize your numbers for the current season; rutgers offense (if you can call it that) in 2018 and oregon st on defense must have given their fans nightmares
12Xpert,"and nish i think your answer to your question is to be found in the article:
""it doesnt matter if we win or not [w]e beat the line in every single bet today. and when you beat the line... thats better than sex.
#winwithwits"
12Xpert,some interesting debates in these threads about closing line value/efficiency. im not convinced by the argument that using large volumes of money to manipulate a market disproves the more general hypothesis. but it certainly illustrates that closing line value is a very nuanced concept.
12Xpert,appreciated although  daily fantasy sports  forget i'm still a leech living off the losses of people who  daily fantasy sports  listen. that must presumably make me a hypocrite. i'll take that. better that wishing people died. (shit i can't write today 3rd time lucky.)
12Xpert,so betting is mostly a game of luck with the opportunity for some skill. but the more players with any skill compete with each other the more those skills begin to cancel out and luck will dominate even more. thats the paradox of skill.
12Xpert,yes you will say dont blame the eu blame the nations for not doing that. but were talking about the same elitist politicians here who are all pro eu and dont believe the electorate should be considered because they arent sophisticated enough to understand.
12Xpert,have a look on the fixtures webpage. usually its friday afternoon for weekend fixtures(extra leagues friday morning) and tuesday morning for midweek fixtures. occasionally like this week it might change because im on holiday or something like that so post them when i can
12Xpert,and  are just morally reprehensible full stop because they claimed their affiliate business was a brand liability so shut it ruining the businesses of many but in reality continued to work via third party relationships with the very people who brought it into disrepute
12Xpert,i imagine a lot of ratings systems manage that over large match sample. the problem is that they have greater accuracy variance over smaller samples of matches compared to implied probabilities based on bookmaker odds which is why they fail to make a profit.

JambosPicks,not quite sure what you are asking here or where the 5.89 units comes from? our  college basketball  records page shows the daily units vs the line at the us books listed the units vs cris line and the units vs cris at close.
mschwimer,this is exactly correct!  that is what makes us completely different than other touts.  with other touts a subscriber loses and thats it.  with our service we will pay you if our picks can't beat the market.  therefore providing the subscriber with financial value.
mschwimer,well. my argument will be 100 percent  factual. wont have any opinions. just pure scientific facts. i choose to believe the majority of your audience will understand that. but if you disagree i would believe you as you know your audience better than me.
mschwimer,do you not understand what it means to file a reg d with the sec? plain and simple. if we dont pay the guarantee then we would be in breach of contract and would be breaking the law. maybe you should do more research.
mschwimer,we have far greater and much larger aspirations than a subscription service. our service will only last a couple years at the most. the world will catch on and we will become the worldwide market setter in all major sports. then the fun begins!
mschwimer,all packages start on tuesday. latest to sign up is 5pm. i intentionally didnt include it as an option because i didnt want people inadvertently signing up for next weeks 4 week package when they wanted picks immediately. the packages resurface at midnight tonight
mschwimer,i think its a great suggestion. adds a lot more manual work on our end but i will strongly consider it. can tell you it wont happen quickly but maybe make it a separate package in the near future. thanks again for the suggestion!
RufusPeabody,provide an outlet for bettors who feel they were mistreated (whether illegal or not) by legal books to file reports. create a repository that we can use to better understand issues bettors are having. what books are misbehaving? use this to influence legislation.
RufusPeabody,question for  if i get credit accounts with a credit line of 100000 (i  daily fantasy sports  have to put in anything up front) and i lose one week and have to pay 10000 but the next week win 20000 what's my roi?
RufusPeabody,you post a cumulative record of which a large portion is retroactive (and supposedly verified by accountants). people want to know the record since you started selling and giving these money back guarantees. before that is just people taking you at your word
RufusPeabody,if a used car salesman told me a car hadn't broken down the last 1642 miles i would be pretty damn sure it broke down 1643 miles ago. what car dealer would advertise that way if the car had a good long-term history??
RufusPeabody,though to be fair i've seen some really different weather observations for different points around there. point is -- if someplace pretty close to the course had weather that didn't show a *huge* advantage --  it is  just so damn hard to forecast!
RufusPeabody,scott verplank was my favorite golfer growing up. by happenstance my family was staying with friends who lived at kingsmill where a pga event happened to be taking place. ten-year-old me followed  (and phil tataurangi) around the course for most of two days...
RufusPeabody,and the other issue is you'll have plenty of pick-sellers who appear to be verified winners just based on randomness and people will sign up because of that. just like they do with mutual funds. tracking closing line value would help combat this.
RufusPeabody,"exhaustive summary of  --

jeffma,im sure  will grill me about all of this on our next podcast. willing to have one of you guys come on to ask me all the questions you want also... provided you use the words cuck and disgraceful as much as possible
jeffma,this never had anything to do with whether you can pick winners (which i really dont care if you can or cant) it has everything to do with you touting a very flawed betting strategy and trying to explain it with flawed logic
SportsCheetah,end having seen bama and texas offenses already. it was the uga game primarily where i was on ou 1h and i brought it up because uga hadnt face an offense anywhere near what ou was doing (sec title game was vs. auburn).
capjack2000,first he was on temporary leave from gn when the violation occurred. he was laid off because it was the slow summer period in the sportsbook. during this time he was responsible for paying his share of his insurance benefits while laid off.
capjack2000,"let us  do a little math breakdown on that $333k parlay hit that everyone is talking about. 

first the payout was $333k but that includes the original stake of $7050. so it was actually $326k. or +4625 in us odds.

capjack2000,"my favorite bill lyon column was a fictional meeting of the four philly teams at the legion of sports excellence (lose) held atop city hall. 

written in the late 80's it chronicled how each had come from the depths of their 70's despair."
capjack2000,they must think americans dont like to push on their bets because you cant push a total in any sport. all totals end in 0.5. youll need to figure out which side you want to be on and  deal with the non-standard vig:
capjack2000,inquirer had bill lyon...that made the difference for me. plus dn was the paper you bought inquirer was the paper that was always on your doorstep each morning. i read a lot more inquirers growing up (after my dad was finished with them).
capjack2000,btw the guys at sporttrade asked me my thoughts on cash-out v. hedging and a quote appears in the blog. i have no affiliation with sporttrade but i mean  it is  a potential betting exchange in the us -- i'm all for it.
capjack2000,"here's an interesting chart to ponder. in august 2018   had a virtual monopoly of mobile sports wagering in nj. now they trail  by almost a 2:1 margin. 

what made the fd product more appealing for dk to lose a first-to-market advantage so quickly?"
capjack2000,i've struggled with this as well. my feeling is it creates too much of a cloud of murkiness. even if you only accept affiliate deals from the best books for sharps it still creates doubt. it limits the ability to monetize your content.
capjack2000,"the accessibility of everyone involved in such a small setting makes it a great exchange of information. as legalization grows this conference will grow. it was very euro-centric this year...but as the american market gets their legs i think that will shift.

capjack2000,"its easy to fall into hyperbole on twitter but this is unprecedented in its egregiousness. 

theyre attempting to solve a problem of unfair market advantage by creating an unfair market advantage that they profit from. books can buy that feed bettors can not."
dinkinc,wow   he posted a winning bet josy.  must be good.  oh wait.  he posted a video about how unlucky he is.  typical sucker. thinks he is smart when he wins and unlucky when he loses. sad.  dont give him the attention he seeks
dinkinc,i just defended t.  i thought that was important.  debating you about health insurance is not. i have medicare now at least until this president takes it away to help pay for parades and golf. i am done andy. have a good day
dinkinc,if mike trout proclaimed he was the best player ever he would get slammed for being disrespectful to the games past and rightly so... amazing how donald trump does not get that reaction.. i am sure he knows little about any past presidents
robpizzola,i actually liked it a lot the first time i watched it and then as i did a series rematch i realized it just wasnt up to the level of everything else. action for the sake of action. too many plot points overlooked.
RASPicks,buying picks or starting a betting partnership requires a high level of due diligence including references and some expertise of the industry which is why the continued endorsement/support of people shipping accounts over to someone with no long term record is so baffling.
RASPicks,any up-and-coming originator with a clear and quantifiable edge in any market who is interested in getting a freeroll email admin to discuss further.  not really interested in past records or plays without reasoning just want to be compelled to bet your stuff.
RASPicks,just noting we've improved our release methods in recent years with last year being a huge step in the right direction. clients now receive the play before  it is  officially released and no longer must 'hunt' for a rot # in short order.

CizzlingSports,"(11/x) screenshot on the left is from the  app from about a week ago. screenshot on the right is recent.

spanky,i understand both your points. he was a dead man walking already. he took a parting shot. again thats not my style but ill be lying if i told you i was never tempted to listen to the take-a-shot-devil on my left shoulder
spanky,"lets keep the follow friday rollin.

there are two bookmakers that i could never beat and it aint pinny or cris.

one was spiros the greek.

the other were these hillbillies out of arkansas/alabama. 

both  and  at one time worked for those hillbillies."
spanky,"good stuff adam. 

line move analysis is such an underrated skill.  

instead of handicapping games you learn how to handicap bookmakers tendencies. they have access to the best information.

even if youre a great handicapper youd be remiss not honing this important craft."
spanky,"pro tip:

many bettors incorrectly look at the spread in isolation of the total. 

a spread half point is worth a lot more on a lower game total. 

similarly teasing through nfl 3 and 7 is more valuable on games with lower totals."
spanky,i like most who have been doing this long enough have been stiffed many times. ive been stiffed by both bookmakers and betting partners. we do our due diligence and get good references; nonetheless we sometimes are still left holding the bag. (2/5)
spanky,"i have coded models.  keeping those modes relevant is the challenge.  

my top down market analysis approach spotting inefficiencies and discrepancies will always be relevant.  my time is much better spent on this.

this way the worlds best handicappers indirectly work for me."
spanky,this uk sentiment cant infect our borders. elected officials must insist that if a sportsbook can not manage risk effectively and instead must resort to the extreme measure of kicking out winning players they should not be granted a  bookmaking license to operate.
spanky,shout out to  for taking the time to not only write such a great piece but taking the time to hang out with me.  dave worked so hard interviewing and researching. hes an incredible writer and im proud to call him my friend.
spanky,a 1-2 poker game aint same as a 100-200 poker game. its still poker but when the stakes are higher the conditions change. motivation is a huge part with guys playing more minutes and playing in situations they arent used to playing in.
spanky,"amazing conference #bosamerica. the amount of talent was amazing- 
media law data analytics tech politics and everything in between.
upncoming bookmakers who used to be bettors; legendary bookmakers who paved the way; sharp bettors who im proud to call friends. had a blast!"
spanky,so much negativity about this. this is entertainment tv guys. there is an inverse correlation between winning bettors and entertaining bettors.  winning bettors are usually not the life of the cocktail party and would make for terrible television. there are exceptions of course.
spanky,taking less on the app vs over the counter is very similar to offshore books taking more over the phone vs internet. this is a 1995 bookmaking mentality.  was a pioneer when they stopped accepting phone bets.  followed suit with higher web limits(1/2)
DocBettor,"got some dms asking about live dealer online blackjack. majority of games won't get adequate deck penetration and you'll likely be banned but here's a hi-lo card counting tracker with ideal bet size:

DocBettor,clutch shot by devonte graham but i'll play the role of old man yelling at cloud and say i'm dismayed by the hornets' suboptimal clock management. they got possession with 42 seconds left in a tie game. gotta get the 2-for-1 there. #nbatwitter

PlusEVAnalytics,great example of antifragility (exposure to positive surprises). guy reaches out to me after hearing  we talk sports betting he has a side hustle selling smell proof weed bags () which i didnt know were even a thing and i really want one.
PlusEVAnalytics,ok enough with the tease (pun intended). if jeff and rufus wont do this im happy to. i dont have a fancy podcast but my credentials in this space are at least as good as mr blackjack over there. when do we record?
PlusEVAnalytics,totally agree. now what is the source of the power imbalance? homogeneity of (generally unskilled) labor and barriers to job switching (think one factory towns). these things exist more in some times/places/industries and less in others. where do content creators in 2019 fit?
PlusEVAnalytics,todays bayesian tennis question...over/underperformance (vs priors) on past service points is predictive of future service points in the same match. how predictive is it of future return points? equally or zero would make my life much easier but i fear its in between...
aluckyaday,"yep. big part of the soft book model. offer loss leading sports prices/promotions to get the clients then push the casinos hoping to catch whales. works because they can limit liability by restricting anyone who only takes advantage of the +ev 
 sportsbook offers/prices."
aluckyaday,investors are happy? i wonder if those investors have considered how and when they are actually going to get a return on their investment. even if the models are successful scaling to get a significant return is going to be a huge issue.

aluckyaday,exactly aspiring bettors can always get down. recreational betting is a different market. it is not for players like yourself. do you moan about people playing roulette? recreational books do not stop players graduating to sharp markets. they are pretty good training grounds.
aluckyaday,it is. but unlike retail recreational punting is not really about giving the customer the best value in price terms. they are paying for entertainment. if they are entertained (enjoy the betting process/product) they will continue to buy it regardless of the margins.
aluckyaday,"even if books have better models. books prices are not just driven by efficient price models they have to take in to account public biases to maximize profit. a sufficiently good model can detect this bias and profit from their ""deliberately inefficient"" numbers."
aluckyaday,good luck with that. in this game money wins. when books realize that a soft book model is a much more profitable way to operate they have to switch or get swallowed up. that is why almost all european books are now soft.
aluckyaday,that is mainly because the salaries are low not because people can't get jobs. why be a nurse here when you can get 3 times that in the uk where there is a demand. there is a shortage of staff here this summer!
aluckyaday,"but they did not cut the stakes to 20p because of evidence showing ""anyone can get addicted to gambling its inherently addictive"" as you claimed. they cut the stakes because the more a vulnerable person can stake the more harm it can do."
aluckyaday,i'm not saying they can't beat pinnacles trading prices. i'm dispute the fact that many are sharper than pinnacle. either they have better data or pinnacle have their trading price different to what they consider to be the fair price for trading reasons.
aluckyaday,randomness is a huge part of betting  daily fantasy sports  let if fool you. roi is not always the best way to look at the performance of your bets. there is some great stuff on this by  on the pinnacle resources website. 1/2
aluckyaday,but it gone a bit silly at the moment. the number of firsts has risen significantly over the last few years. nothing to do with tuition fees and the need to attract bums to seats all to do with the rise in standards.
aluckyaday,"tbh rufus in europe (not sure about the us) most touts are not deliberate scammers. they genuinely believe they are finding value but likely its a combination of overconfidence and survivorship bias. you could probably say the same about most ""professional"" gamblers too!"
aluckyaday,exactly. soft books are entertainment companies competing for disposable income from people who are playing for the dopamine hit rather than to make money. if your intention is to make money then these books are not for you and you should not bother.
aluckyaday,i believe  is run as a business though and there are conflicts of interest! i think  has run a proofing service in the past. he can explain the pitfalls better than most. in fact did you not write a book about it joseph?
EdMillerPoker,"the number of games has to do with how expensive it is to put someone in every stadium.

again weve already built this so i know exactly how it works. lower latency/scout data gets you more uptime but doesnt fundamentally change the product."
EdMillerPoker,most of all of that lives either in europe or offshore at the moment and most of it is held together with bubble gum and duct tape. one large state with friendly regs could take over as national center for all of it.
EdMillerPoker,"agree. in general i think  it is  a square peg/round hole to turn sports betting into a ""lottery game"". doesn't mean a lottery couldn't offer it but imo for it to be really worthwhile they'd ideally be flexible and thinking outside the box."

LockyLockerson,oh  it is  a huge mismatch and bowman was awesome.  but i just have it as too many even with the change at qb.   daily fantasy sports  think you'll have to sweat it in terms of result of the game on the field.
LockyLockerson,also for those who read the book this year lsu was number one in talent score and man you saw a lot of that talent in a lot of areas tonight.  wouldnt be an outlier at all for them to make the playoff.
LockyLockerson,the numbers are all gonna be pretty good now because if they weren't and it was obvious that means every person with any acumen looked and somehow missed the valuable bet that was there.  probably not happening without some newsy informational change introduced.
LockyLockerson,"so a few things in the preseason seem to be really stable.  total points scored in a game for example is within a really narrow range. 

one thing  that is  moved somewhat interestingly though is median margin of victory for the home team."
LockyLockerson,there is not a math-based reason to bet under 2.5 right now i'll just say that.  but they sure will be a fun team to root against all year if you make the bet because many days they're going to get completely walloped.
LockyLockerson,"as  noted on his most recent podcast the average nfl win total is off by 2+ wins (2.18 since 2010) which is significantly more than in college because in college so many games have insane spreads and are essentially ""bought"" wins.  less uncertainty."

DannyParkins,the only thing ill say about the bears schedule is it is a tier 1 patriots/cowboys/steelers esque schedule. three thursday games one monday two sunday night plus multiple 3:25 slates for nantz/buck number 1 broadcast teams plus london plus thanksgiving. thats no joke.

Ccon8181,so many games in foxbourgh the #patriots get the most random/phantom calls in their favor. didnt have to sweat cowboys because the over  was dead 6 minutes into 2nd half... not saying the pats arent good but they benefit from sone phantom calls
Ccon8181,over the course of his tenure ive burned through at least 50k (being conservative) backing the #browns with highly inflated lines. the ways in which they crushed me should go down in the sportsbetting hall of shame. chao hue you wont be missed
ToddFuhrman,"thanks boys...appreciate the kind words as we know some folks treat gambling as a ""fun"" topic to discuss which is fine but for us  it is  about making every listener smarter and glad you hear the homework come through on air each show"
ToddFuhrman,"one of the most valuable pieces of advice for aspiring sports bettors is to be honest w/yourself

recognize strengths  weaknesses
keep accurate records by sport to determine profitability/edge
understand plenty of good bets lose and bad bets win; be leery of confirmation bias"
ToddFuhrman,the game played at its highest level and two second legs ill not soon forget. however can love a sport as a fan and still admit when a half was a dud that fit the bill the same way people blasted the superbowl
ToddFuhrman,believe i saw the same ticket but think it was 15k to win a shade more than 75k on a 9 teamer.  most books won't allow parlays of 16 legs but depending on the odds paid anywhere from 86-1 to 95-1 i believe
12Xpert,was this change made to make the piece more morally emotive? or was it made because the original title was so obviously stupid? or both? and  it is  been done without changing the content to attempt to correlate high staker with gambling addict.
12Xpert,the majority of punters  daily fantasy sports  read a paywall newspaper either. those who are banned already know why and i  daily fantasy sports  think  it is  particularly insightful to criticise dc. instead talk about why recreational bookmaking exists in the first place.
12Xpert,digging this up from 6 month ago. fractionally kelly does reduce your expected (mean) bank growth significantly but not your median. since kelly possible worlds are log-normally distributed you won't see the mean very often the median is a better indicator of expectation.
12Xpert,it is  just the principle of price discovery. of course humans are biased and facilitate inefficient prices but eventually those inefficiencies get understood and exploited away too. the market always evolves but the larger it becomes the harder it is to beat it.
12Xpert,"in fact there's about a 1 percent  chance you'd be showing a loss after 9548 bets with the bets that have taken place just because of bad luck. so ask your self again: ""think you know small sample size; think you understand variance?"""
12Xpert,so lets go back to the beginning. the links between cause and effect in betting are very weak just as they are in poker. that means most not all but most of what happens luck. betting like poker is a low validity environment.
12Xpert,we  daily fantasy sports  have corbyn's socialism yet. i hope we never do. i agree this country could work for more people. i just happen to think that a healthy liberal democracy built on capitalist principles is the best way to achieve that.
12Xpert,is there data in those graphs that supports this position i.e. old while male wealth correlates with privilege? is is not an example of conformation bias to assume that these people must be privileged? isn't it possible that some have worked very hard?

mschwimer,and 4 percent  edge is our minimum. we average over 6 percent  edge. after you do that math you will see the numbers we are looking at. that is the reason we are offering the package we are offering. makes perfect mathematical sense.
mschwimer,no. hard hit percent  are facts in the way you are defining. it has a definition and is tracked. hard hit means any ball that leaves the bat at 95mph or more. google mlb savant and have fun typing in players names etc.
RufusPeabody,"lsu's game grade yesterday (+60!) was the best this season (per  and  it is  not particularly close.

clemson registered a +33 second-best of bowl season with ohio state's gg of +25.1 coming in behind unc (+30.5) iowa (+29) and notre dame (+28.5)."
RufusPeabody,you could argue that a team will save its best plays for the highest leverage situations. if that was the case epa/play would make much more sense predictively. but we know third down performance is no more predictive than 1st  2nd down.
RufusPeabody,at 4pm et on saturday this had a chance to be the worst betting week i've ever had. but a nice turnaround late saturday great nfl sunday and munoz shipping it in a playoff and somehow i pull out a winning week.
RufusPeabody,i do have love for the bankers at the stephanie  sunset  branch in henderson nv. theyve treated me so well over the years. i feel like im seeing old friends every time i go. but the company as a whole? not good.
RufusPeabody,i would totally do a usaa referral program if they had one. they are fantastic! use them for car home rental and umbrella insurance too. only problem is the no physical branches thing which isnt great when youre in a cash business.
RufusPeabody,we'll still publish our nfl power ratings every week and i'll give out a few plays on  you can easily calculate mp lines by looking at the difference in team ratings and adding in home field advantage (on average about 2.4 points).
RufusPeabody,weather as well as its impact on variance is factored in. if you think 12 back has much of a chance despite the conditions im guessing you havent looked at the data. it happens a lot more rarely than you might think.
RufusPeabody,pretty freaking good thursday. sipping a local ipa with a half-dozen oysters right on the beach after a really solid r1 of the pga plus i played 18 hole myself. and best of all tomorrow morning  . not missing boston one bit.
RufusPeabody,my point was and still is that if the government wants to take your money they will use that (the offshore gambling) as a way to do it. they  daily fantasy sports  have to convict *you* of anything to take the money.
RufusPeabody,i think he has the skills to be incredibly successful in business but needs to listen and learn. and realize that he doesn't have the answer to everything and sometimes there are people that know more than he does about an industry.
jeffma,if they simply let the shot clock run down to zero and dont take a shot their win prob is about 93 percent . so if you give them any chance to score at end of possession the choice is pretty obvious

capjack2000,this promo is an example of decent $ positive expected value but poor certainty equivalency (ce). given the relatively short duration of the bet and the bankroll required  it is  hard to make a case for not throwing a benjamin on this.
capjack2000,"promos are great. freeplay odds boosts bonuses. 

however for a sharp bettor or an aspiring sharp bettor the best promo is reduced juice.  it is  not even close. 

it can be good for the book too if they use the information correctly."
capjack2000,"i think aml/kyc concerns make it tricky not the wire act. there are many syndicates and hedge fund guys wanting to make markets on sportsbetting exchanges. 

regulators are going to freak over where all this money is coming from. 

(rightfully so tbh)"
capjack2000,"when you place a wager the book must have resources on-hand to cover the payout. this is one reason why nj restricts liability to $5mil on any wager. 

there's no chance your wager wins...but there's also no upside in booking it either."
capjack2000,"here's why you  daily fantasy sports  use the scroll bar to change odds. you end up with 17 line moves in 25 seconds. 

anyone want to guess which vegas book this was? guilty party want to come forward before i name you?"
capjack2000,thanks for the boots on the ground report  i was relaying what i had been told.  for what  it is  worth  weve got the atm fees on play+ here in nj as well. thats one of the reasons i prefer other methods.
capjack2000,"this tweet raises so many questions...
- why does dst affect lines...
- why use the euro date format and cite pacific time zone...
- why doesn't pinnacle attempt to enter the us market if a company like pokerstars can be regulated..."
capjack2000,"in honor of talk like a pirate day  here's my pirate joke:

pirate walks into a bar and he's got a ship's steering wheel attached to his crotch. he goes up to the bartender and says ""arrr give me some grog!"" 

1/2"
capjack2000,"random thought which i might expand on later via blog or vlog...

nfl is the natural gateway to sportsbetting for most americans because it is so easy to understand value with a pointspread. 

moneylines can be confusing. however +7.5 is straightforward.

capjack2000,"i'm hearing more and more of this lately. these nj operators are reverting to their gray-market roots and being ridiculous in trying to find ways to avoid paying customers during the slow time of the year.

njdge you are losing your grip."
capjack2000,"shouldn't have much of an effect on betamerica. either they'll continue to use sbtech for b2b odds or they'll find someone else. 

now  on the other hand...they're properly f'd when you factor in  doing the same thing with their acquisition of betbright."
capjack2000,yep $2k! tax rate is 16 percent  for mobile operators. obviously suitability hearings and regulatory compliance will cost far more than $2k but the point being it'll enable a startup to try their hand in the maine market for relatively cheap.    2/4
capjack2000,"i wouldn't mind seeing an advertising aggregation service start up so that content providers do not have to deal directly with casino/sportsbook advertisers.

dinkinc,i am at the middle game of the red sox -padres series which i will be at all three with 12 red sox fans from boston who bought tickets in may sure these games would matter.. stop complaining ...they suggest joe kelly
robpizzola,props are typically a much softer market than full game lines or totals hence books are not willing to take big bets. it is tough to get large sums of money down on any prop let alone an nhl prop (smaller market).
robpizzola,russell wilson has no offensive line or defense this season. the rams have both + one of the best receiving groups in the league. russell wilson also doesn't need his head coach to read defenses for him at the line of scrimmage.
RASPicks,you can't ask people why they  daily fantasy sports  just bet their winning picks while at the same time tell us how hard it is to get down and keep outs if you do win. everyone needs to find their own balance.

suuma810,"last season kyle shanahan called the 9th-most runs in the first half despite the #49ers offense being the 3rd-worst at running before halftime as measured by expected points added per run (non-scrambles).

but they ranked 4th in play action yards per play."
ClevTA,"well after an entire week of ppl saying allen is really good and is lamar light  that is  not a performance  that is  indicative of that. also there's a wide gap between ""big week"" and 44 percent  and 3.7 ypa incompetent play"
CizzlingSports,"took a cursory look and it seems sobel isnt even yoshing; he really is this awful with a reasonable bet spread.

spanky,its all good. i advised that whole crew to try and better themselves. they unfortunately arent good enough to bet professionally so they instead let out their frustration via twitter hate.  sad cuz most are smart enough but theyll never make it.
spanky,"accepting payment on a losing bet could give the bookmaker future justification to not pay a winning bet. obviously doesnt apply to the regulated markets. 

i operate in a world where we police ourselves and millions are transacted on handshakes and credit."
spanky,one of many who would applaud my banishment.  i came up in a world of walters baxter spiro henry qt and everyone in between and still found a way to earn.  rather than hate on me find a way to better yourself.
spanky,sounds so basic yet so many people unsuccessfully try to make a number from the ground up. top down is where the moneys at. you dont have to know anything about players stats etc.. you can also be an expert at everything.
spanky,this isnt the equities markets where hundreds of millions are transacted every minute. this is the relativity small sports market where getting down 10k is a monster for most places. establishing a regulatory body for these petty amounts is a ways away.
spanky,not crying buddy. just raising awareness. i am not a bookmaker im a bettor. its how i make my living. if places continue to operate the way this place does my future livelihood could be in jeopardy.  dont be a twitter troll.
spanky,buddy of mine just sent me this from  .  blocked me.  i was thinking about crashing this focus group suggesting they implore proper risk management without having to resort to the extreme measure of kicking out winning players. anyone wanna join me?
aluckyaday,what about the ones that carry a plastic replica marshmallow switch it with the real one which gets stuffed in the mouth. then when the second marsh mallow is forthcoming eat that too and slip the plastic one back in their pocket?
aluckyaday,i was just wondering if there were ever any qualifiers. does the price discrepancy between soft and sharp ever go outside the margin? changing the spread would complicate things. although pinny shows prices around the current spread so maybe it would work.

aluckyaday,well if you have an edge you still get the compounding effect traded for variance just not the freebie on top. for random bettors without an edge its a very fucky bet as they get bigger negative expected value and more variance!
aluckyaday,i can back test the effect of staking if you like. how would you like me to do it? stake each individual part to win 1pt so the total stake would vary and the win on a full house would be 15pts?

aluckyaday,guess its like any bet. is there enough value in it to take the risk? and just like a bet whatever the outcome we can never be sure what the true risk actually was. just whether you won the bet or not.
aluckyaday,pros will always find a way to get on. bitcoin books asian brokers exchanges friendly traders that are willing to pay if you really have useful information. in reality if they are good enough its an inconvenience rather than a real issue.
aluckyaday,exactly. neither have i but it was a theoretical paper. not done the math but if it happened i would guess anyone betting full kelly would have doubled their bet by then. it was not 20 bets it was 20 winning bets!
aluckyaday,back in the late 80s before microsoft when ^k^v was king my computer science degree final year project was to develop a grammar checker in prolog. my battle with noun phrases verb phrases and where to place articles has never left me!
aluckyaday,could the draw bias not just be due to an incorrect public perception that a low draw is better. resulting in higher odds for the higher draw horses. i.e. there is no physical reason for the draw bias just a mathematical one?
aluckyaday,this is actually one of the things the uk regulator actually did something about after similar problems here. bonus and cash funds must be kept separate. bonus funds are wagered before cash. anything in cash funds can be withdrawn at any time.
theFirmAISports,great books. definitely used all of them during grad school. i would also highly recommend these two: brownlees book is mostly high level info focused on quick application/understanding. his blog is also a great resource. dr. adrians book is much more in-depth.
theFirmAISports,great article i really appreciated it. but you actually claimed luke walton was your favorite player... wow... thats rough. my favorite onion article ever is still:  kobe is a winner in all aspects. his drive/work ethic always elevated him in my view
theFirmAISports,the data that this model was trained on showed that there were certain interactions between other inputs and the day that impacted the dependent variable. most teams arent affected much by it but its still one of the inputs in this model.
theFirmAISports,i appreciate kris perspective on watching game film and taking notes on the psychology of the team. its easy to get lost in the stats but its useful to blend in those psychological affects. also i agree that even-keeled emotion is key.
joeytunes2,twitter arguing isnt really worth my time.  it is  your job i get that. i'm out to make money. not troll guys who win. but if you want to have a contest or want me to move a game for you. lmk.
joeytunes2,basically we are holding duq who are tied at half with dayton. so i was asked to hedge. but if we were down 14 at half. you cant hedge and you would be  stuck on the wrong side with the entire bet.
EdMillerPoker,"was a limit game so not at all big. they had a regular $20-$40 and sometimes $40-$80 there.

mirage stopped being a thing roughly when wynn aria and venetian opened rooms which would have been shortly after 2003 dont recall exact dates."
EdMillerPoker,"for that you need good trained people systems it infrastructure etc.  that is  the part we're ramping up right now.

now our long-term goal is to be a lines provider for sportsbooks but we have a shorter-term goal also which is education."
EdMillerPoker,"will invoice a random person who s this in next 24  hours a $300 retweet fee.

i wrote a sports betting book with   that is  in the home stretch. eta end of may/beginning of june.  it is  very good. if you have any interest in sports betting you should read it. more news in coming days."
EdMillerPoker,nevada is a small state which is a big disadvantage. theres also a lot of regulatory friction. i think nevada could act now by changing regs and offering incentives and remain center of american sports betting but window is likely closing imo.
EdMillerPoker,it is  low stakes for anyone who could ap it and hi stakes/time commitment for recs. honestly if they made it a monster event with like a $1k buyin in a warehouse somewhere or just online they might be on to something

nonrandomalpha,yeah its all relative. if players from the 30s were playing today they wouldnt be in the same mold as they were in the 30s. the players just havent changed the routines the diets the foods the training has all gotten better.
nonrandomalpha,haha right? east coasters will not be standing in lines. vegas just visually demonstrates how behind the times most of the bettors are. these boomers arent the future and them standing in line like morons arent a sign of a books superiority.
nonrandomalpha,trubisky apologists are the worst breed of delusionist bears fan. blind loyalty with zero expectation of reciprocity or return. its these types of fans that perpetuate mediocrity by this franchise. where there should be outrage instead there is excuse and acceptance. pathetic
nonrandomalpha,who do you think youre pissing off? rams fans are nonchalant and give zero fucks. youre grandstanding and rams fans just go about their day completely unperturbed afterward. they live in la and much more going on in their lives than sport.
nonrandomalpha,if you go 48 percent  during a period but you demonstrate viable alternatives did worse over same period then the subscriber will not defect unless they leave the subscriber universe all together which is unlikely. sometimes even sharp bettors have underperforming months/quarters.
nonrandomalpha,its tough to be a contrarian bull on skins with this kind of shallow talent pool. by the time they throw haskins to the wolves this could be a 3-5 win team. under on the win total  looking juicer by the day.
LeeSharpeNFL,i have bal to win 78 percent  of the time in week 17 with rg3 which i think probably too high (especially as bal probably rests more people than jackson but my model doesn't go down to the player-level outside of quarterbacks).
LeeSharpeNFL,"referring to pff grades as mere ""opinions"" does them a disservice. they're graded on every play by at least 2 people based on specified grading criterion.

more importantly they have predictive value looking forward so clearly they are capturing a real signal."
LeeSharpeNFL,"kick interference essentially that patterson arrived and hit the returner before the ball got to the returner. but he did not. 

you do have to give the returner distance if he calls for a fair catch but no fair catch was called."
LeeSharpeNFL,"would it be ideal if there was a universal standard expected points added that everyone agreed upon? yes.

do the differences among the various models matter significantly? no.

is expected points added currently the best available public measure of offensive efficiency? yes."
LeeSharpeNFL,"agreed your lt and  are not equally skilled blockers necessarily and you're not going to reverse them on a given play.

unsure how significant an effect this is but we know rbs  daily fantasy sports  matter so the ol should matter some!"
LeeSharpeNFL,"nagy is smart enough to realize the bears ol is never going to win vs. rams pass rush so is wisely having trubisky throw it quickly.

any offensive success the bears have is an argument for coverage mattering more than pass rush."
LeeSharpeNFL,"sometimes i feel like franchises who are used to having good qbs underrate their value or overestimate the difficulty in finding them.

as a fan of a franchise with a....  let us  call it..... different experience having a good qb is everything."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my current season simulator doesn't save each simulated season to the game level to enable a ""filter to scenarios where the game works out this way"". i definitely want to refractor to enable that but alas this may be an offseason project."
whale_capper,i have a strong suspicion that if you are in the 1 percent  the economics are similar if you monetize by selling your edge to players or scaling up with movers and either route your edge dries up on the same timeline
whale_capper,first (only?) nice thing i'll say about the redskins front office... they created enough confusion and concern that the giants took jones 6 instead of waiting until 17 and thereby kept them from getting an elite edge guy... still got their qb
AndyMSFW,"from this summer:
a big part of where we thought the bears would take a step back was them likely not intercepting 27 passes and getting 36 total takeaways again.  they have three games to get 20 takeaways and prove me wrong."

LockyLockerson,those are projections which because they are shaped completely by the market from those teams' previous games are pretty sharp.  why is the difference there? rest? injury? no reason? important questions to answer.  this early it has seemed like rest is overrated.
LockyLockerson,ten-cle: everyone loves the browns this year and i  daily fantasy sports  as much so it makes sense this is the largest difference of the week.  i make it cleveland -1.5 market is 6.  so...yeah gimme tennessee for a couple more bucks.
LockyLockerson,"although not stated explicitly if the two teams were to play in the semifinal ""no"" would be a winner the way the bet is written.  that extra permutation definitely makes ""no"" extremely appealing moreso than just ""will they both make the playoff."""
DannyParkins,looks like security walked that fan in the blue shirt off courtside after replay showed he pushed kyle lowry when he dove into the seats next to him. jvg oddly defended the guy who shoved him with whats he supposed to do?

Gingfacekillah,good books. not necessarily where i'd recommend someone start but with sports betting its a good idea to read as much as you possibly can. at the very least it gives you some context and scope before you head for uncharted waters.
Gingfacekillah,getting to the end here. his results imply that sharp money may correct any noise trading (square) money biases and bring the market back towards aggregate efficiency. none of his strategies could be shown to be statistically significant. big surprise right lol
Gingfacekillah,"""it is amazing how the more time spent on accurately pricing a game to  spot inefficiencies the more of an afterthought bankroll management  becomes.""

that is absolutely true. finding the inefficiencies is the part you want to work the hardest at imo."
Gingfacekillah,this is a salient point. despite the potential for overfitting with moneyline the data science field certainly makes all who study it vastly more aware of the overfitting problem generally and the tools and processes that can be used to mitigate it.
Gingfacekillah,theyve all missed something. some ignore vig. some assume 2 percent positive expected value over 1000 bets is definitive. most of the time its an interesting idea applied badly. i like to read them and try to extract what might be useful.
logan_matthews9,"from a modeling standpoint this is difficult because you either 

1) combine the scores for everything and model the total course in one hodgepodge training set

2) split out the courses individually modeling them with very small sample sizes

neither is great"
logan_matthews9,"i think both of these things can be true - orgeron turned things around mostly because of the people around him but he also deserves credit for that. 

budget doesnt mean what it once did - as evidenced by tennessee texas etc."
logan_matthews9,okay #gamblingtwitter - looking for some recs - anyone doing big time overviews of the weekend ahead for  college football ? currently have the  podcast and  threads but looking for others who do good analysis on things my model might be missing
logan_matthews9,tulsa -6.5: michigan state is going to make a lot of teams offenses look bad but tulsa still held their offense to just over 300 yards. sjst gave up almost that much to northern colorado who went 2-9 last year in fbs
logan_matthews9,i use bitcoin never had an issue with either of those two. generally 24-48 hours. ive never been limited on those two but i get hit with limits fairly regularly on bovada (mostly from repetitively hitting bad lines they dont take down)
logan_matthews9,"youll never believe this - but the model really likes troy merritt again (who won the event last year)! so far weve got:
merritt to win: .3u to win 8u
merritt over polston: 2u
malnati over hossler: 1u
roach over dufner: 1u"
logan_matthews9,if the us goes and lands a giant egg at the gold cup its totally fair to question berhalter. if they go and win it and maybe its because they take holmes instead of mihailovic - he deserves praise for the process
logan_matthews9,interesting. im not nearly as confident in my over under stuff - its just built off my initial model which predicts players impact on a teams offense and defensive rating. im just using those and pace to get a line for score

adamchernoff,"thanks for all of the replies. 

collective agreement on kc between -7.5 and -9. hou was anywhere from pk to -4 nothing higher. essentially rating allen making his first playoff start (on the road) just slightly worse than watson at home. interesting."
adamchernoff,if i knew haskins was going to come in and their best wide receiver was going to blow his hamstring in practice two days after i bet i probably would not have bet either haha. but  that is  how it goes sometimes.
adamchernoff,be debatable. they will both be an exact number created by the process. the idea that betting less and being more conservative is actually backwards as not maximizing opportunities can be equally detrimental to over betting. as someone who spoke very similar...

ToddFuhrman,"i never want to hear a damn thing about the ncaa and their push for ""integrity"" if this is even being considered

2nd chances are one thing but the opportunity to lead men 18-22 again after what transpired at baylor is criminal"
12Xpert,"favourite-longhot bias.  that is  part of a wider influence of possibility and certainty effects how we're bad at judging small and large probabilities.

illusion of control: how we underestimate the influence of chance believing we make things happen more than we do."
12Xpert,there is less interest less information more variance more risk so bookmakers reduce limits. presumably casinos employ lower limits on 1 to 36 roulette game compared to black-red. what's your point? i'm still waiting for the data that show performances aren't quasi-random.
12Xpert,yet further evidence that society doesn't really give a shit about mental health. in terms of a medical science timeline we are still very much at the medieval leech therapy stage a word which ironically is quite apt in this case. #phonehacking
12Xpert,in this context if there is one thing worse than newspapers trolling phone hacking and spreading fake news  it is  politicians threatening to curtain their freedoms. readers can think for themselves and vote with their wallets. liverpool managed it without political interference.
12Xpert,there are laws and there are morals. they dont necessarily correlate perfectly. advisory and non binding are frequently used as arguments to reject the referendum result. they would never have been used by the same people if the result had been different.
12Xpert,we came out of last glacial period (colloquially known as ice ages) about 10000 years ago. typically warmer interglacials last about 10000 years compared to longer periods of cold. this natural periodicity is driven by orbital (milankovitch) cycles over 10s/100s thousands yrs.
12Xpert,if advertising effects are complex with the potential to create numerous confounding factors is it then really fair to conclude that consumers should be protected against the targeted content of gambling advertising if the research hasn't shown whether it has an impact.
12Xpert,casinos manage just fine. players know they can win only by being lucky but are still happy to play. why can't it be the same with sports if bookmakers refuse to allow skill (in the same way casinos publicly refuse card counters)?
12Xpert,make a hypothesis that these things will make you a millionaire and test if it works  daily fantasy sports  work backwards from all the millionaires you see and look at what they did. it turns causality on its head and is flawed.
12Xpert,"i'll happily agree with that criticism and your interpretation of what's happening. i use ""winners v losers"" really as a metaphorical simplification. this was from my last book maybe  it is  closer to what you are talking about (hope  it is  readable)."
12Xpert,why am i going too far? you haven't set out a case. we agree that there are a small percentage of bettors who will show true +ev. i happen to think that figure at a book like pinny is probably 1 percent
12Xpert,i've no idea when the ratings are released but given they have them for games a long way in advance presumably before pinny release their odds. source for 538 ratings already shown in this thread source for closing pinny odds is oddsportal.
12Xpert,thanks. yes i can be bothered. i've found the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons. that should be sufficient. will take a bit of time to match up with my pinny closing prices. still better than standing on a platform at crewe eh jez?
mschwimer,if someone didnt buy week 1 and then bought the 4 week package they would be losing money. which is why we reimbursed them $2000. jambos lost $1100 per package bought. when subs lose. we lose. which is how it should be.
RufusPeabody,"this tweet is in honor of the people ive seen in sportsbooks complaining about hitting 7 legs of an 8-teamer: 

you are n times more likely to hit all but one leg of an n-leg parlay than to hit every leg."
RufusPeabody,the issue here is simple economics: a for-profit company being granted a monopoly is detrimental to consumers. imagine how expensive gas would be if exxonmobil got a contract to be the only company that could sell gasoline in the united states.
RufusPeabody,"nfc playoff probabilities per  simulations:

no 99 percent 
sf 91 percent 
min 87 percent 
sea 87 percent 
gb 87 percent 
dal 64 percent 
phi 43 percent 
lar 37 percent 
chi 2.2 percent 
car 2.2 percent 
atl 0.2 percent 
det 0.1 percent"
RufusPeabody,havent read it but the argument is never that exchanges are the answer to everything. they just make way too much sense for situations where two people would like to bet opposite sides but cant because books wont take their action.
RufusPeabody,please remember: if you buy a pick from a tout if the tout has a 55 percent  win rate (which would be extraordinary!) betting at -110 you need to bet 20 times the price of the pick just to break even.
RufusPeabody,yes i read that. but think about what a 15 percent  expected hold entails in terms of price.  it is  completely unrealistic and shows that the firm that did this (spectrum) does not understand the basics of how sports betting works.
RufusPeabody,stanley's is way worse than van de velde's. both needed double bogeys to win but van de velde was playing a very difficult hole while stanley had an par 5 that was the easiest hole on the course. not close imo.

capjack2000,"these contracts in emerging states tend to be short-term (1-2yr). that was william hill's problem with hollywood. nv contracts could be longer we'll see.

capjack2000,"actually lower margin in september inflating handle in october was a factor. the nj market during football is largely weekly not daily.

capjack2000,final thoughts on #bosamerica - it was a great gathering of regulators operators bookmakers traders pundits and even some bettors. many people tell me how great the early days of the sloan conference were...and i think there's a parallel here.  1/3

dinkinc,am i a bad person for feeling sorry for don cherry ?  i know its a bad take but i always saw him as archie bunker not as donald trump. intentions have to matter at least a little ... maybe ??
dinkinc,almost as funny as when you got ko-ed by a kick to the head... will you laugh when he gets a ten game suspension too...cleveland fans are really showing class tonight... props to mayfield for not finding this funny at all
dinkinc,all politicians take a secret blood oath to never care about right or wrong or what the people want who voted them in. you must protect the party at all costs.  then you will be financially set for life .. #secretoath

robpizzola,questionable = uncertain if player will play.  it is  amazing how 100 percent  of these uncertainties end up resulting in the player taking the field for new england. almost as if  it is  not an uncertainty  i do not know .
robpizzola,a really good thread that everyone should take the time to read. aside from adam saying that donbest works well (it has been the bane of my existence at times) i pretty much echo everything that adam has said in here.
robpizzola,there should be a price where youre willing to back any goalie in the league. he is a huge downgrade from fleury but even so the price is absurd with pavelski out. and tbh jones is a pretty bad goaltender himself.
RASPicks,looking to add an entry-level position to our team immediately. if youre passionate about college football and betting have a great work ethic and already spend countless hours a week on it because you love it send an e-mail to rightanglesports
RASPicks,our lifetime nflx win rate is 66 percent  but that is a sample of just 54 plays over 2 seasons and highly unlikely to be sustained long term.  if i were handicapping it i would set the over/under at 14-10-1 +3.0u.
RASPicks,for various reasons it is an asset that so far we still think is worth maintaining.  we've scaled back our offerings considerably in recent years not due to performance or product demand - both of which are as good as ever.
RASPicks,"there are exceptions and many pro bettors do pay for picks.  reasons:  
1) line moves (middles/market timing)  
2) write-ups/info (they can filter)

spanky,"i think matt blocked me after these tweets





sorry matt if you took offense to my bad acting comment. but come on now it was pretty funny. 

im still looking for answers bout the caesars limits cut and who made it"
spanky,you have no clue about what i do in my business. those pennies ive made amounted to lots of dollars.  i dont have to post picks of cash like you do (see below). just ask any established bookmaker about my history.
spanky,not in this automated era.  phone betting is a dead art. theres not many opportunities to establish a relationship. i would tip injuries to my bookmaker all the time when id call in. now the business just moves way too fast.
spanky,dont take this the wrong way tom but you sound like your friends dick and harry.  handicapping the nfl is a long uphill climb. if you must bet the nfl youre better off simply price shopping and taking the outlying numbers.
spanky,i like to look for the good in people. if his talents were used for good he would be a valuable asset to any company world wide. unfortunately he is on the dark side which i obviously do not approve of.
spanky,yes. i took an e felony in 2012 in ny. the crazy thing is that i plead guilty to booking bets that i actually placed. i never accepted bets from anyone.  its a long story that one day will come out....
spanky,can't do that.  you have to fill out a ctr and say whos money it is.  tellking the truth will result in auto banishment.. telling a lie is a crime... if you bet your own bankroll then its a different story.
spanky,that is incorrect. full kelly with accurate edge assessment yields a 13.5 percent  chance of going broke.  in my world there is a 0 percent  chance i ever go broke. not a .0000001 percent  a 0 percent  chance..... i got kids!
spanky,i have no clue.  i dont bet season futures. most of my betting is on credit and tying up my credit for an entire season is never the right play.  this time of year i need credit like i need blood.
spanky,another victim of the unscrupulous methodology of  .  would some elected politician please stand up for us.  winning should not be treated as a crime.  why are we letting this virus of a bookmaker operate in our country. someone please help!

PlusEVAnalytics,its less a pitfalls of mc and more a (valid) criticism of the use of the # of simulations as a way to judge the validity of a model. a terribly designed simulation run a trillion times will give terrible results.
PlusEVAnalytics,so be careful out there everyone. its a free service and you get what you pay for but know were in the wild west. not the will smith battling robots wickedy-wickedy-wild wild west the one where rules dont exist. the end.
PlusEVAnalytics,is there a better metaphor for the liberal/conservative divide than kenny vs spenny? kenny is an unrepentant asshole who proudly lies cheats and steals. spenny is a gullible whiner who feels like hes entitled to win because hes a good person.
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont get the covering more combinations argument. its like buying all combinations in the lottery - it doesnt get you any more positive expected value and it still boils down to how likely you are to hold a unique combination.
aluckyaday,yep. this is why many of them complain about soft books restricting. they are not sharp enough to beat a sharp book. i have a term for them recreational sharps. i'm pretty much a recreational sharp myself. its not that difficult....
aluckyaday,in that particular period history shows the lower odds were less profitable. it goes back to the same argument is 600 bets enough to determine anything significant? is that information useful going forward? what happens when you reorder the full history
aluckyaday,not a great advert for their other revenue streams if the sports betting is a failure! according to the original article they are doing this to prove their models as it looks like they did not get their original target business
aluckyaday,exactly. fair in running betting is not possible for the masses. someone is always going to have a technological advantage. bookmakers can protect themselves by restricting accounts but if you are joe public betting in running should be off your radar.
aluckyaday,but early betfair liquidity is pants. would not be too difficult to push an early price out on betfair and then smash the books with guaranteed money! it goes on at the moment but with mbl the floodgates would be opened.
aluckyaday,because i thought you might do a proper analysis of his results. if you are serious about proving his ability you need to look at price movements and how likely over the long term his results are to occur by chance.
joeyisaks,i dont think shady is really the right way to put it they run a business. its ok to market your own business if you want to attack pick sellers id pick and choose my battles instead of going after ras
EdMillerPoker,the idea is to train yourself to spot the errors in the pricing feeds. the errors are very common and at least semi-predictable as well. use multiple feeds plus watch the game and youll start to see where the mistakes are.
EdMillerPoker,all of a sudden there's 9 figures of new investment capital thanks to us market. a lot of that money isn't going to be playing follow the leader on 365 esp since 365 themselves i think will struggle in the us.
EdMillerPoker,i guess i also thought it was kinda a weird claim because the number of mme players who didn't suck at it back then was pretty damn small and also tended not to be the main ones ppl were complaining about.
EdMillerPoker,lol the very same people who make this argument are the ones who have tried to tell me my business sucks because why would anyone pay for a good line when you can just cancel the bets on the bad lines
EdMillerPoker,on the other hand i see tons of people making the mistake of thinking that they can basically take public off the shelf sports analytics and go beat major markets with it without combining it somehow with some closely held insight.
EdMillerPoker,if i were a foreign company wanting to operate in this space my mission 1 would be to make myself as indispensable as possible to the domestic stakeholders. so far obv having limited public info this is not what im seeing.
EdMillerPoker,so this is the time of game where you'll start seeing sportsbooks take down their in-game markets completely.  it is  a shame because  it is  maybe the most interesting time to bet near the end when the result is in doubt.
EdMillerPoker,i'm fairly sure  it is  due to the regulatory issues  alluded to. for example we think we have built an nfl in-game product that would be perfect for several operators in nevada but as of today we cannot sell it here.
EdMillerPoker,basically we want to teach people about in-play betting how it works how to be a smart bettor how lines get made everything. why do we want to do this if our end goal is to have sportsbooks be our customers?
EdMillerPoker,"and i think it will never make sense to deal any markets where the result of the current play substantially matters to the price while the play is actually in progress. to me  that is  just a ""how football works"" thing."
EdMillerPoker,the terms of this agreement are subject to change at any time and for any reason and in any way including voiding the agreement at my sole discretion with or without prior notice and with or without notification of any kind.
EdMillerPoker,tip #4. publish thousands and thousands of randomly generated beats to soundcloud and then sue the shit out of any pop star who comes out with a song even vaguely reminiscent of even a few seconds of any of your crap.
EdMillerPoker,in 100 years i will be dead but my inbox will live on full from lists someone else signed me up for by using my email for their acct and i dont know their login creds and therefore can never unsub
EdMillerPoker,equities exist because a company that produces actual things needs more liquidity. the people that buy equities want exposure to the upside of the business without actually having to produce the things. options exist because the people with the equities want...
EdMillerPoker,i hear what i think is constant miscalculation about a market like nj (or pa or whatever) by extrapolating either from nv or uk. nv is heavy tourist market. uk is.. another continent different culture different set of sports etc etc.
EdMillerPoker,i think a lot of operators are used to soccer which is obv not a timeout product and theyre trying to shoehorn the same model onto a sport like football where every play is high leverage compared to the hold  percent
EdMillerPoker,the most obv one is anyone who wants to actually bet volume. but also many casual-class customers. the leagues want fan engagement and imo several operators would be well-served to ask how can i build something that actually maximizes fan engagement

nonrandomalpha,if anything i'm confident these narratives are already overly priced into the number. 2 quick anecdotes from last season: cowboys (playing for nothing) beating/covering the giants and bears (playing for nothin) beating/covering the vikes (who need to win to make playoffs)
nonrandomalpha,this dude got the spine to tell the truth. i never lost more respect for fellow bears fans than this season. new gen tru fanboys are schizo and such a poor reflection of chicago intellect. remind me of classic gb fans.
nonrandomalpha,if i use someones data i will credit them; not only because its not my data but it lets the audience know that the conclusions are drawn on the data and if the data is wrong then the conclusions are wrong.
nonrandomalpha,young starters especially should play in the preseason. if you get hurt you get hurt. so many penalties and whiffs last night that it cost us a loss at home v a division opponent. who cares if were healthy and lose.
nonrandomalpha,well said. of course some will lack the sophisticated reasoning skill to fully appreciate the merits of your feedback (we *are* talking about sports bettors here not ivy league-educated pension fund cios) but cheers to your efforts and your continued success.
nonrandomalpha,aj green reportedly sprained ankle his ankle will probably be limited throughout the entire preseason. he's turning 31 in 4 days gotta wonder if age is starting to catchup to him. for context dez bryant is 3 months *younger* than aj.

if you're gonna take the delay of game call timeout with :01 on the play clock not :16.

that entire sequence was incredibly badly handled."
LeeSharpeNFL,"that is  fair though the really tiny set of people who can speak to it an informative way does make it harder to have a conversation to which is in some sense the point. but yeah ""a decade"" was understating it."
LeeSharpeNFL,"oh of course. they did amazing work and i wasn't trying to discredit it. but having it available in production in real time is incredibly awesome.

i too wish ngs data was public but it is obviously not our call sadly."
LeeSharpeNFL,for fumbles my initial thought was calculate the mean expected points added on fumbles and treat all fumbles as that. i think fumbling should be a (lack of) skill whereas recovery and yards afterward seem like they should be pretty random.
LeeSharpeNFL,but seriously i was shocked at how aggressive the cousins signing was when it happened with the full guarantee and thought it was bad but now i think i was wrong. contract numbers are within reason and he's doing well there.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the statement said his suspension was for ""shoving an opponent to the ground during an altercation"" nothing else. i  daily fantasy sports  think  that is  overkill unless the push was clearly a perhaps somewhat late attempt to tackle which this wasn't."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i usually  daily fantasy sports  do non-football tweets here but:

some friends do a hilariously entertaining charity drive marathon where you play the world's most boring video game:  

check it out consider giving them some money to help sick kids.  #db2019"

2set your fantasy lineups
3charge your phone
4put in one extra parlay 
5settle in and cash all your tickets"
AndyMSFW,"matchups settled by the cut went 4-1 (+3.161x)

83 men through so i think there will be a secondary cut after today. (need  to confirm)

spreadsheet with everything:"
AndyMSFW,radford getting dummied at home was a bit surprising but they shot like shit so whatcha gonna do?  hofstra moves on this morning and colgate finds it way into the patriot league championship so it wasn't all bad news so far.
AndyMSFW,asun: my only future made the sunday final where they will probably be around a +260 dog  unhedge-able at this point so i'm letting it ride and possibly buying out of some live or at halftime if the opportunity presents itself.
JoeyKnish22,folks. today is the last day to pay for the knish invitational.  if you havent paid by tonight. weve gotta delete your entry. games kickoff tomorrow. sorry for the hardline stance but we dont wanna be chasing people down all month.
JoeyKnish22,"nobody lies about game start times more than mls. and those fucks get me everytime. the tv guide says 7pm est. the score apps say 7. google says 7. the official site says 7. 

the game is kicking off at 730."
JoeyKnish22,if it makes you feel better this is a collaboration between a guy who bets hockey and a guy who bets college football neither of whom make any money betting mls. so i would double whatever stake you had in mind.
JoeyKnish22,hes even said he doesnt fancy himself all that great at trivia/historical knowledge. i wouldnt price him near -500 vs emma boettcher in a rematch (whos in this) much less entire tourney. james himself would tell you thats a bad price.
TheKostos,"i just want you for my own

baybay"
TheKostos,bummed that my man  isn't on  this sunday with me breaking down nfl games but happy that dp will be back for week 13 onward for us to bust chops laugh at each other make bets and break down games together
TheKostos,"the coaching and officiating has never been worse than it is in the year of our lord 2019. inane ridiculous shit happens every week that costs people hard-earned money and there's zero recompense for it.

can't wait to bet week 11"
LockyLockerson,haha nah i mean we talked about it a lot on the show tuesday thats why i keep referencing it.  people thought they were dead when really they have multiple paths still.  at a giant number it was an interesting discussion.
LockyLockerson,will be on the show briefly tonight to discuss college football games this week since  spent a lot of monday and tuesday looking back and looking at cfp rankings (which was also really really fun and you should listen to it)
LockyLockerson,ind-ten: we begin with one of the larger differences i make this titans by 2 and with 3.5's starting to pop in a few places i think  that is  valuable to grab with indy.  indy +3.5 if you can find one.
LockyLockerson,kind of interesting that michigan could win a game other teams could lose and michigan's price would go up to win the title (just re-opened +1950 at bm).  clearly people unhappy with what they're seeing from the wolverines thru 2 games.
LockyLockerson,well sides/totals much much harder to beat obviously but with that being said i like miami at 7 fiu at 3 on the first thursday and have a weird vibe that oregon state might be super-competitive at home vs the pokes.
LockyLockerson,"some great completely non-predictive golf trends floating around.  here's mine:

66.6 percent  of the major winners this year have ""wood"" in their name.  so i'll take fleetwood and westwood and you guys can have all the people battling for 2nd place."
EliHershkovich,". signaling possible bears' regression   it is  hard to argue.

chicago's passing attack with at least a 52 percent  success rate in three of its first five games but repeated the same rate in just three of its final 12 contests:"
DannyParkins,lol ive actually never gotten free food from there but of course that does happen. its just right across the street from the studio so its convenient. radio offers are often made of urgency. always down for tips or suggestions though...
DannyParkins,i never in a million years thought that would be so controversial on air. who is contributing to the wins is the right people so  that is  what matters 74-84 wins is largely irrelevant as long as young guys are carrying.
Gingfacekillah,really depends how you want to approach it: parametric frequentist models bayesian approaches machine learning. my general approach is to try and leave no stone unturned. ive got a ton of books recommended on my tl for you to peruse though!
Gingfacekillah,anecdotally what i've observed seems to agree with this. a market could be efficient on the aggregate yet be inefficient at the individual game/player level. if the inefficiencies averaged out they would be difficult to spot from a high level analysis.
Gingfacekillah,like all sports it starts getting more interesting when you model it decently and begin making money. lot of randomness. injuries  individual player considerations very important. scoring distribution is a mash up of multiple distributions which makes things a bit wonky
logan_matthews9,its technically worthless because as of now you provide nothing of value. youve got a handful of cheap data scientists and think you are revolutionizing things. anyone who has raised money before knows that getting whatever amount you did is immaterial
logan_matthews9,im not on any lanto just have him as a high variance play for anything because his 2020 profile looks nothing like 2018. i have him very slightly above kang who im not crazy on because of a weak green/atg game
logan_matthews9,"sprinkled a little more kuchar at +5550 on bookmaker. have him at just under 6 percent 

handful of t5/t10s i like but would like to see another book open them besides bol. will want to spread the exposure around as well"
logan_matthews9,the other two midfielders have been given less freedom with their movement. previously and most notably in the mexico game they were given free reign and when out of possession the us struggled to press effectively and were getting caught out
logan_matthews9,you must not be very aware if you think people dont rip vegas dave and the like all the time. and jambos is no different than any other tout - making promises they cant keep - they just have better marketing
logan_matthews9,another point on the adams-at-rb-hate for the #usmnt - gb clearly designed this role specifically with adams in mind. i dont think we can ask much more from a coaching staff than to build roles designed for the uss top talent
PikachuBets,you're such a joke lmao. always touting the positive record. why didn't you tally up  college football  with the prior nfl recaps? why  daily fantasy sports  you show your play by play record (w/ emojis no less) for the losing weeks?
PikachuBets,"full fucking tilt today after houston bullshit last night. we betting every game 2nite

usc +3.5
usc u53

boise st -7
boise st u55

(i only had usc +4 before today)

l. f. g. b. o. i. z."
PikachuBets,"op i agree. being able to ""see"" things like this that others can't is the key reason you need to tout and spell words like ""pix"" and tweet about 6-1 trends in cfl as proof that you are a good ""capper"""
PikachuBets,yes i do. thus  it is  fair game for ppl to shit on just like how i'm shitting on his kids. but i also like the part where you changed the subject! nice ad hominem did your mom teach you that?
PikachuBets,if doordash shows me a big ass map after i make my order why isn't there a live tracker on the driver so i can see if i get to eat ribs i get cucked by another summer league game tonight?
PikachuBets,pikachu translator: np well look into why we sell sooper bogus seekrit numbers generated from useless consensus reports that are elementary extrapolations of tiny sample sizes from a few unnamed sportsbooks. the answer isnt bc were sleazy media guys we swear!
PikachuBets,now to his credit he has responded pretty well far better than most other touts (who just block any naysayers immediately) to these criticisms. that doesn't mean they didn't need to be made when we initially saw what he was doing.
adamchernoff,very good point. we tried to walk from metlife over to the sports book after the game. ended up on the wrong side of the race track and ended up walking a lap. seinfeld jokes were fantastic along the way though.
adamchernoff,"well if ""it is useless to try to interpret line movements  the results of sharp us punters"" is the conclusion you've reached after 40 years of doing this i hope your next 40 years are much more insightful. enjoy the sunday."
adamchernoff,sorry thursday and friday show openings have been a little testy. not trying to make a routine of it. just some mind boggling stuff being said about nfl betting and markets this week that have got me a bit fired up.
adamchernoff,markets have a lot more time to settle but the results stay almost the same (ind game gets weird) looking at prices from a week ago. detroit took money too with the under - two more to add to the list.
adamchernoff,thanks for listening james! always great to have another international listener on board . great to see the podcast continue to spread worldwide with 20-25 percent  of downloads each morning coming from england ireland spain germany and australia - among others.
adamchernoff,"said before betting should follow these steps:

1.) use method(s) to project probability 
2.) convert probability to price
3.) compare price to available market prices
4.) determine difference between projected price and best market entry price
5.) stake according to difference"
adamchernoff,using the history tab bettors can follow along with game results for green (1+ run difference) yellow (0.50 - 1 run difference) and red (0.01 - 0.50 run difference). white occurs when there is insufficient pitcher data (less than 30 starts).
adamchernoff,"houston: 

pass o success rate: 20th
rush o success rate: 29th
pass d success rate: 10th
rush d success rate: 3rd
o line: 23rd
d line: 7th

quietly coming around need more success from the ground game to open up pass."
adamchernoff,"kansas city:

pass o success rate: 3rd
rush o success rate: 3rd
pass d success rate: 21st
rush d success rate: 32nd
o line: 19th
d line: 32nd

the inability of the defence to tackle/stop the run will cost this team...eventually."
Ccon8181,is it just me or did we used to have bowl games during the week before christmas?? i dont like this new scheduling format. there are 6 bowl games this saturday.. cmon nothing beats a 11am tuesday bowl game #bowlseason #bowlgames
Ccon8181,"weekly recap:

the most disappointing kiss your sister week ever. after starting 5-1 end the week 5-5 after a 2x loss on browns full game and 2nd half 

last week: 5-5 

season to date : 31-28-3 

time to gain some separation"
Ccon8181,#tcu changes quarterbacks benching robinson and whata ya know. back to back touchdown passes. been saying it since last year college game too fast for robinson... which they made the switch for the texas tech game when i backed tcu. #tcuvsou
kellyinvegas,this graphic is the bowl contest between the social guys of  and myself. we picked the games prior to bowl season starting and unfortunately they are locked. so when ive gotten info on the other side ive actually played against this.
ToddFuhrman,"kudos to  for how he called this absurd uva sequence with so much pointspread drama hanging in the balance

some day in the not so distant future we'll have gambling analysts alongside rules officials in the booth on every major telecast"
ToddFuhrman,eh i saw some issues with them against rice; vanilla or not execution wasn't crisp so  it is  a wait and see approach at least for the next few weeks. definitely one of the more fascinating games this week at um
ToddFuhrman,i'll 2nd payne on the win total given some major concerns qb depth wise if something happened to lawrence.  as for the grey i've definitely added some dealing with payne all these years but i'm also 20 years older than him
ToddFuhrman,"agreed

im not taking anything away from golden sts pedigree and closing ability today showed heart of a champion but i think if youre the rockets this is inexcusable and you wonder if it couldnt happen this year it might never..."
ToddFuhrman,so what's the point of seeding if they weren't lower overall but  daily fantasy sports  follow an s-curve? i know what the committee chair said but it leaves me scratching my head when they say these things and actually believe them
ToddFuhrman,because if you cave here what's nest...preseason nfl intl soccer friendlies etc.   it is  just not a good look and unless they have compelling data or are willing to make a case publicly to support this sounds like a power play
ToddFuhrman,"one of the most challenging aspects of the daily sports betting grind is that good bets will lose and bad bets will win.

 daily fantasy sports  fall victim to confirmation bias and let short term success create bad long term habits"
TheCousinSal,was the strategy down 1-0 for 3 defenders to keep retreating and allow a blistering shot into the corner of the net? would those same defenders have stepped up if it were 0-0?  im a dumb/confused american. please help me genius.
TheCousinSal,on an all new against all odds the degenerate trifecta  i tackle each ncaa conference winner + heisman picks - then minutes before the suspension is announced ohio state great    i discuss whether or not urban meyer will be suspended. #gambling
12Xpert,does this thread and the attached threads bring into question the entire tipping/tout industry? if tipsters are good at what they do how do more than just a couple of customers get the expected profits?  has plenty to say on this.
12Xpert,there are lots of winners br but they are lucky. these are allowed  it is  the sharp winners the recreational books  daily fantasy sports  want. hence ads that give the idea that savvy thinking is welcomed or encouraged should be banned.
12Xpert,as a soundbite because they didn't believe he represented their values. from an economic perspective because they didn't believe that they wouldn't be hammered to pay for all that he promised and possibly also thought that half the promises weren't necessary.
12Xpert,in fact reading the letter it doesn't actually say anything about the ifs's position and says nothing about whether such public spending plans can be paid for only by the top 5 percent . it simple agrees with the spending plans.
12Xpert,they do. and we know the chances of you beating the closing line by 3 percent  plus margin over this sample because of luck is zero. which does imply that you or at least the information that you hold moves lines.
12Xpert,"there are great stories in sport. and then there are fairytales.

an interesting series of threads speculating on mo farah and his connection to alberto salazar former trainer and today banned for doping athletes. as always ross tucker  has relevant perspective."
12Xpert,on the basis of the data i analysed i  daily fantasy sports  agree that tennis is fully efficient. i haven't determined from this data if the source of this efficiency lies with the smaller events only or also extends to atp/wta.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  wish to downplay the terrible consequences on some families of problem gambling but we should keep perspective. for nearly everyone gambling like the cinema smoking drinking and going on holiday is fun it makes dopamine and serotonin.
12Xpert,i hope health and safety will be considered when assessing whether to go ahead with todays planned route for silver group. already close to 100m rain has fallen in past 24 hours and more rain and gales is expected for saturday.
12Xpert,you know that i typically  daily fantasy sports  agree with blocking people but perhaps he doesn't take too kindly to your critical approach without having actually read the book. why not read it first and then make your comments on that.
12Xpert,yes pretty much. there will be a few seconds difference between collecting pinny odds from oddsportal and the market maximums from betbrain. and there may be some errors due to oddsportal and/or betbrain using bookies' apis which are out of date.

mschwimer,the money that is filed comes from the lps. we are the gp and take 3 and 30. thats where the income stream comes from. we are in many lines of business. subscription company is the smallest line we are in.
mschwimer,that is simply not true. please stop spreading lies. im not up nothing lifetime. im down a lot. im a historically losing bettor. legit have not won in a single season. but then i hired a modeling team and everything changed.
mschwimer,going live on  in 5 minutes or so to talk with  and  going to talk about how dirty the tout industry is and how  will change it. also call out touts who refuse to put their money where their mouth is!
mschwimer,because they want to mitagste risk it leaves a huge opening for sharps. but they limit sharps. which means the market isnt fair. if anyone could be anything they want then closing line value is by far the most important thing.
RufusPeabody,"college football  week 9: 
mean absolute error 13.64
mean squared error 261.72 

y touchdown :
mean absolute error 12.07
mean squared error 236.64

what'd i tell you  - was only a matter of time till we got north of 12."
RufusPeabody,to those saying oklahoma is out of the playoff picture now... is a 1-loss big-12 champion really not in the conversation? a loss means ou needs to be perfect from here on out but they're still very much in it.
RufusPeabody,with (2) you are getting the wisdom of the collective (1)s who have skin in the game. whats the point of hiring (1)s  how good your opening price is really doesnt matter. (talking about standard pregame markets here not props/live)
RufusPeabody,and you wouldn't solve the survivorship bias problem -- a tout could have a series of sites where he/she gives out completely different picks. they're able to tout the performance of the one that happens to by chance perform well.
SportsCheetah,i hang with my family on sundays but i'm typically at red rock for the  college football  slate on saturdays. i  daily fantasy sports  drink but feel free to come by and buy me a dr. pepper if you're around.
capjack2000,"my only comment is the jan  feb numbers may reflect winning futures tickets that were cashed while the losing tickets were already accounted for when they were purchased. could make deceptive numbers. 

surprised there were a few oct/nov/dec losers though."
capjack2000,"to those eligible...this is a good deal. be careful in that pointsbet has been known to restrict promos for those who play exclusively promos or are deemed sharp. 

my advice:  daily fantasy sports  be afraid of variance on this play."
capjack2000,sure i get their skepticism.  it is  also why i  daily fantasy sports  work for or run an affiliate site. i'm just saying discounting every opinion of someone who has unobstructed access to the inside of the industry is short-sighted.
capjack2000,the over-arching problem is that once your limits are lowered on those props they're lowered on everything. whether you have an edge or not. for instance if i try to bet the reds at +170 in that game for $500:
capjack2000,the whole argument should be moot. every bar in nj hell every starbucks in nj is a sports betting parlor. nj needs to advertise to neighboring states how easy it is to register deposit and bet sports on mobile apps.

robpizzola,i'll give the patriots the benefit of the doubt on this one because i can't imagine a world in which belichick is willing to admit that his team is so bad that they have to cheat to beat the bengals.
robpizzola,its also scary to see how much of a downgrade there is defensively when chiellini is out of the lineup. rugani still growing but hes not good enough. bonucci is nowhere near the quality that he was at his peak.
RASPicks,below average  college football  season for us that included an 0-6 week 5. finished 26-23 (53.1 percent ) for +0.55 units including the free picks on twitter to start the season. will have this year's  college basketball  service up soon.

VegasRefund,"pats fans calling for gostkowski to be cut after that game.. the same fans will name their next born child after him if he comes up clutch in the playoffs.

VegasRefund,random and not a promo tweet.. but  their stuff is probably one of the better finds ive come across in a while. tommy bahama meets lulu lemon (minus the yoga). tweeting about clothes here thats how much i dig it.
ProfessorShine,also im not counting offshores who list an opener for marketing like best of luck  others. many of lv openers are also done for marketing.  2  years ago westgate posted the 1st nba finals odds;  it was up for 15mins.
ProfessorShine,darren also never addressed the potential of their content which flies in the face of helping any bettor to be better.   then the other tan reps promote their wins  ignore their losses for subscribers.  isnt this why pregame takes heat?
suuma810,expected pats  jags both to struggle to move the ball. my total was 44. pats struggled jags didn't. jags much better without force-feeding fournette best game i've seen from bortles. the fourth quarter touchdowns hurt but i'll take my loss.
suuma810,took broncos -3 +100 over -2.5 -120. edge on den with great hfa markets haven't caught up to seahawks turnover. felt line was too short. den moved the ball sea needed big plays. keenum with some dumb mistakes. pushed happens.

ClevTA,i think ne is the right side for sure but its always hard to give deshaun a lot of points. his record as an underdog is really good (except for the ravens gm of course). i wouldve guessed 3.5 personally
ClevTA,if pamphile is out tomorrow he will be replaced by douglas a guy who didnt play a snap last year and hasnt played a snap since 2015 in miami. he was rated 96th out of 106 guards in 2015. yikes
CizzlingSports,(5/x)not clear from the report how information contained in paras. a)2 and b)2 of the assertions is audit-able. the report does not explain how the auditor was able to cross-check that the selected plays met  predetermined criteriafrom [the] proprietary model
CizzlingSports,"and then you have to factor in fees of course. $3000 for the 17-week packages that started on 9/3 and 10/8 both of which are loosing.

and 1-week subs have needed $10000.00+ bankrolls even betting only $300/game.

 it is  absurd."

spanky,i like it adam but i'm looking for something someone could listen to or watch where they do not know any of the players whatsoever.  it would be boring for many many people but i may enjoy filling the void...
spanky,all three of those are very powerful numbers. however looking at averages is going down the wrong path.  look at clusters of 3s and 7s.  dont let missed pats deter you.  they are often undone by subsequent successful 2pt conversation
spanky,"this was a new brand of idiot. id like to say theyre extinct but they arent. some are still running nevada sports books.  in fact one is the ceo of a multinational bookmaking concern.

we hear 
you loud and clear."
spanky,just finished reading then one day by  chris andrews.  incredible read.  i highly recommend this to anyone involved in the business in any way shape or form. my favorite parts/quotes of the book (in no particular order) are listed below
spanky,assuming it wins on the 21st year at +130 one would make approx. 4 percent  compound interest annually with risk involved!  i personally would take the 10k guarantee a win and return 23k 21 years from now in a heartbeat.
spanky,just as in finance in sports betting there is fundamental analysis (handicapping) and technical analysis (line movement).  i hire and outsource guys to do the former which supports the later.  imo most handicappers have an inadequate technical analysis foundation.  fa+ta=$$$$$$
PlusEVAnalytics,bullshit. the negative expected value is the price paid for the enjoyment only the bettor doesnt know what that price is. so you either disclose it which nobody wants to do or you force it to be fair and non-predatory.
PlusEVAnalytics,tip: before playing that 10 game parlay have an honest conversation with yourself about whether youll hedge that last game. yes? then make it a 9 game parlay. save some money and stress and dont give those assholes  the satisfaction.
PlusEVAnalytics,cool question. if the genetics suggests that the probability distribution can be different for different sets of parents then rev. bayes is most definitely in the house. if they dont then its 52 percent  or whatever the global frequency is.
PlusEVAnalytics,the supercontest has little if anything to do with nfl handicapping. its either a dart throwing luckfest or an intense study in game theory depending on who you ask but handicapping skill has little or nothing to do with it.
PlusEVAnalytics,cdn cannabis companies are struggling financially. imo their growth projections were way too aggressive - theres a big diff between legal and socially acceptable. nobody at office talking about im gonna get stoned this weekend. laws change instantaneouslyattitudes take time.
aluckyaday,yes. the pinnacle basketball trader said in a twitter chat that they take a position in just about every market they operate in. this article is more like an advert than something that should be in the betting resources section!
aluckyaday,"buffalo bills at cleveland browns back cleveland browns -3
kansas city chiefs at tennessee titans back tennessee titans +6
los angeles rams at pittsburgh steelers back pittsburgh steelers +4
seattle seahawks at san francisco 49ers back san francisco 49ers -6"
aluckyaday,that is an interesting idea. but would the recs move to betfair? my guess is the now sharper books would offer them if betfair did but wait until price discovery between sharps on betfair had happened before opening them fully.
aluckyaday,good to chat to you too. i might be wrong about the way the us turns out but its looking similar to the evolution that has happened in europe in past 20 years compressed in to a much shorter timescale!
aluckyaday,the article forget to mention that if you show any level of skill what so ever backing horses the fixed odds companies will refuse to take your bets! well  that is  how paddy power (aka draftkings) operate in europe anyway!
aluckyaday,unfortunately (well actually intentionally from boris) the debate was probably too late to make any difference. hopefully mps do the right thing and stop him from forming a government. will they have the balls to do it? i doubt it.
aluckyaday,you do realize jeopardy guy is a professional gambler? with a little luck assessing odds correctly and making +ev bets will get you a long way in the world series. the same skills he used with great success in jeopardy.

i got sabalenka 18-1 kvitova 28-1 on the womens side. should be a fun tournament! hopefully not too hot and hopefully kyrgios can make a run because tennis is more fun when he wins."
EdMillerPoker,"just saw a 100k+ follower bluecheck hot take well actually charity is bad

semi-serious suggestion. cap the number of followers any account can have. would nip the race to the bottom say the craziest shit i can think of incentive."
EdMillerPoker,"on the other hand maybe were just marketing wrong.

would yall like to know more about how we harness the multidimensionality of an infinity alternative universes with our convolutional neural network ensemble to produce sports predictions that are transcendentally accurate?"
EdMillerPoker,"a weekend mingling with likeminded people schmoozing with some gambling celebrities and just enough pull back the curtain aha moments to keep the brain engaged.

almost to a one these folks shouldnt be leaving the boot camp to go grind."
EdMillerPoker,"if this were a movie the amoral propaganda merchant main character would have their ""what am i doing with my life?"" turnabout moment after being called upon to smear a teenage girl trying to make the world a better place."
EdMillerPoker,"you wouldn't want to bet that way.  that is  just the math to figure out what the theoretical hold percentage is in a market.  that is  the ""how much do i lose if i throw darts at this bet?"" amount."
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  fell way short of projected growth for a number of reasons but imo in large part because average players who just want to pick some players and sweat the games get crushed due to the game design.
EdMillerPoker,disagree with your assumptions there on what ppls self-interest is. strongly think the pro-tax liberals are almost uniformly advocating for their self-interest. anti-tax conservatives almost always are as well. agree that your abortion example doesnt fall neatly in my frame.
EdMillerPoker,for sure i agree most of the benefits dont come from the quality of education (tho thats not zero either). i think most freshmen would be giving up a lot tho if they dropped out to take a job somewhere.
EdMillerPoker,colin drew inventor of the human hibernation pods said his inspiration was trying to get in twice as many nfl showdown slates before he died. i just realized that life from february to august wasnt really worth the aging hit.
GolcondaFund,"polian was extreme but so too are the ravens touts. 

lj and this squad is akin to the best champion on league of legends but only good in one game script. if have to pivot what are they under center?"
GolcondaFund,"not to mention 
when is the last egg laid by the steelers in a motivated spot against the patriots?
just appears we may be in uncharted territory with this steeler offense and we got #squaresharps best picking them laying 4."
nonrandomalpha,redskins getting healthier as lions getting more injured...one of our sources implies there are 7x more tickets on lions at -3.5. i know the redskins have been pure money burners all season but maybe we go to the well again
nonrandomalpha,further to our convo last night re winston - the maturity will show this season and if the bucs schedule wasnt as brutal as it is the over win total would be a high conviction play.  at winston prop futures
LeeSharpeNFL,"x-axis = expected points added changes due to penalties called on opposing offenses (while team in question is on defense)

y-axis = expected points added changes due to penalties called on opposing defenses (while team in question is on offense)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"we're 15 weeks in and only 3 divisions are decided.  that is  pretty great.

every time the nfl talks about expanding the playoffs i dislike it because it makes the regular season less relevant.

the current setup is very good."
LeeSharpeNFL,"hmm now i think i'm coming around to outside.

if he rolled out to the left/right because he was about to be sacked immediately that would clearly be outside right? should it be different just because he moves backward instead?"
LeeSharpeNFL,"""of course we can't use stats in the game. i mean what am i supposed to do? have a nerd following me around furiously typing numbers into rstudio while the play clock is counting down?  daily fantasy sports  be ridiculous."""
LeeSharpeNFL,"the code:

substr(gametime12) 

... converts gametime to a string. then it reduces it to the first two characters which are of course the characters representing the hour.

the as.numeric then converts the resulting hour from a string to a number."
whale_capper,concerned about the rockets organization as a whole... china thing turned them upside down now theyve got a lame duck coach and gm with zero roster flexibility was super hopeful for them too but this might be a lost season
whale_capper,acknowledging that he hasnt been remotely tested... if he keeps performing at this level ill have him on par with 09 revis 11 peterson and 13 sherman which are probably the top three cbs seasons in the modern passing era
whale_capper,my texans angle was their only major hole is cover deep (15+) passes and im willing to pay to see brees can complete those but for sure the atmosphere will be electric and could elevate everyone in black and gold
whale_capper,for sure would need to adjust for pick # but in 24 swings on r1/r2 picks 09-18 im looking at 3  hours (mccourty gronk hightower) 4 singles (solder jones collins jimmy g) 17 ks... not as bad as i thought
AndyMSFW,i never time these right! left a winner off the card last well because i was slow to the punch and opted to just skip at a worse number.  just like sex it feels great to really nail the entry.
AndyMSFW,small field at the  isn't very conducive to my round by round comparison system so again didn't find anything to play for sunday.  only h2h that looks undecided is matsu over finau so hopefully hideki can figure things out today.
JoeyKnish22,"oh great. now we got a bunch of media shills hyping up chase young heisman because theyre salty they missed the preseason burrow numbers. 

joey puts the heisman in his cabinet when he beats bama in 10 days. done deal."
JoeyKnish22,"dont really follow  college basketball  but a guy i know who couldnt hit a rsw bet to save his life likes memphis under. 

if you wanna load up on the over and some memphis natty futures now is the time."
JoeyKnish22,yeah im probably looking at this too narrow minded or just jaded from a history of rec offshore accounts that got smoked taking advantage of live betting. or ppl i know with domestic accounts that also got chopped using live.
TheKostos,both the nfl and mlb hofs cannot be shamed enough. should be shamed on a consistent basis. both voting groups couldnt be more self-righteous or sanctimonious if they tried. and the politicking is disgusting. and baseball might actually be worse!
LockyLockerson,undefeated clemson and ohio state are two spots.  georgia gets the third. are you putting 12-1 non conf champ lsu in over 12-1 conf champ oregon and 12-1 conf champ oklahoma? probably? but man that will make everyone so mad
EliHershkovich,". on nfl  college football  betting with got me even more hyped for  ""you better you bet"" if  that is  possible.

we'll be there for you after bad beats  celebrate all the goodness of a backdoor cover.

EliHershkovich,"""we ( have the second-most money on kentucky of any team in the pool. ... memphis actually the leader in both of those categories (bets $$).""

EliHershkovich,"whoever replaces beilein is officially in for a rebuild.

msu maryland then ohio state? even if the hauser brothers choose wisconsin they'll have to sit out a season. big ten is about to be wide-open beyond sparty and the terps."
DannyParkins,"chris johnson set the nfl record for yards from scrimmage with 2509 in 2009. he had 16  touchdown s.

christian mccaffrey through 8 games is pacing for 2488 yards from scrimmage and 26  touchdown s. 

he absolutely can win mvp."
DannyParkins,getting ready to send ya into the weekend  with  in for mac. we've got some really fun audio to get to we'll discuss a new bears star a circus forming around the team and wanny is in studio at 3.
DannyParkins,"hey look its tvs jeff passan... big fan... just wanted to let you know i listen to parkins is not an exchange that requires an apology sir. 

also passan solid post trade deadline flex immediately taking the fam to hawaii."
DannyParkins,wow. strong stuff from steve stone  calling for the end of maple bats and/or deadening of the ball in the interest of pitcher safety. he says someone will die or be put in a coma in the next 5 years.
DannyParkins,the danny parkins show starts at 9pm ct  sirius 206  zion is out but will the tournament keep your interest for the final 4? we'll also talk about a huge change coming to college sports pi review and nfl over/unders.
DannyParkins,the bulls are 19-33. the 6 seed is 31-20. sure injuries have hurt the bulls but realistically if they were perfectly healthy (which of course never happens) the best case scenario for this team is the 7th seed. basketball purgatory.
Gingfacekillah,"""the deep learning method introduced in this paper provides a way in almost any sport to attempt to determine the additional value of almost any dataset...when the method is applied to the nba it appears to generate above-breakeven wagering profits."""
Gingfacekillah,these aren't just your basic linear regression models either. we'll be using a number of stronger methods including something i consider fairly novel: ensemble modelling in excel. that and lots more inside. i think you're going to really enjoy it.
Gingfacekillah,"a worthwhile endeavour: ""data scientists live at the intersection of coding statistics and critical thinking. as josh wills put it data scientist is a person who is better at statistics than any programmer and better at programming than any statistician."""
Gingfacekillah,"(2/2) original work:

logan_matthews9,"why is the comment tasteless? do you have a lot of black lamar hate examples? 

i think the comment made you uncomfortable but if it doesnt apply to you then it shouldnt. 

i did laugh at the last line though"
logan_matthews9,personally playing pulisic centrally is way more of a playing someone out of position issue but no one seems to care? just reminds me of youth coaches who just put their best players centrally and worst out wide just because
logan_matthews9,the qualifying tournament doesnt take place during a fifa window so any players who play for the first team wont get released - the exception being mls players (who have typically released first team players during non-fifa windows for qualifying)
PikachuBets,this is dumb. if your picks are down then youre down. nobody cares about your subscribers pov with the maybe guarantee youre going to pay the 10k. if youre down youre down. grow some balls and admit it you jerkoff
PikachuBets,ill stand corrected then. thats another issue though...there is no transparency or reliable sourcing as to where most media articles get their numbers from. watching these journalists try to twist revenue numbers into anything coherent makes me cringe so hard
PikachuBets,of course one could actually go and rank firms and come up with any list. im sure there is a top 69 list as well. but in the audit/accounting world there is only the big 4 as a cohesive group.
adamchernoff,it is a crowded show but a well coordinated one with  who has the skill of seeing the big picture on all things sports/betting but also able to deliver it in a thoughtful way that we all can work with.

adamchernoff,well id say that for fairness to those reading you should use odds from the day of publish. if you publish on a thursday using odds from money it may cause a bit of a stir especially in this neighbourhood!
adamchernoff,"full offence vs defensive schedule comparison table. 

simulations projections and power rankings will come next month. for now focus on building a strong foundation for each team. just one team per day leaves 30 extra days to work before kickoff."
adamchernoff,hey thanks for reading i was referring to implied prob difference between the two from the outside looking in (~4 percent  difference for both) not accounting for flat risk. youre very right though makes a difference with that staking approach.
adamchernoff,there is a team greatly over performing their talent level in #ligabancomermx and the market is selling in a big way. is there room to take advantage? my week 11 preview for  exams the situation further and identifies potential value.
adamchernoff,i want the eagles to win for the sake of my +6.5 wager but also because it will set up a sweet wager on new orleans next sunday. this secondary will get absolutely torched by brees on the fast surface.

adamchernoff,games finish on 1 or 2 just 6 percent  of the time in nfl history number has not increased more the last few seasons teasing across zero burns a lot of price in the bet not something i ever recommend.
Ccon8181,they had their shot verse michigan state at home and were 1-15 on mostly wide open 3s before making some meaningless 3s toward the end. palmer was horrendous from the field in their biggest game of the season to date.
Ccon8181,i agree with your point. there are angles but with the lower tear teams playing yesterday there is minimal data to pull from. the majority of those who bet did so to have action. nothing wrong with that just facts.
ToddFuhrman,good point living in fear of a tyrannical dictator with no options the exact same thing as choosing to play a sport under scholarship.  not sure how i missed all of these parallels so thank you for pointing them out
ToddFuhrman,bama starts a true freshman on the ol... that is  one hell of an 17-18 year old matched up with a grown ass man coming for tua.  i think people fail to realize the difference in strength in the trenches
ToddFuhrman,"and no doubt some folks like the browns at 14-1 for me personally thats nowhere close to my number on them so my opinion is overvalued 

as for my yankees sore subject; dont want to discuss their deadline dud ha"
ToddFuhrman,game moves faster than ever and its impossible for any human to be 100 percent  accurate in any sport. we dont give them enough credit for what they do in real time; its a thankless job id never want tbh
ToddFuhrman,"you're not supposed to like losing or even accept it but lebron's behavior lately in losses for a supposed leader has been ridiculous.

you basically tried to trade your entire team; clearly handling himself well in the face of adversity"
TheCousinSal,the craziest thing happened late last night when our elf on the shelf flew onto my youngest sons ipad. the only rule is if you touch or move him you get coal for christmas.  long day ahead for young harrison.
TheCousinSal,well youre going to have to wait at least four years because at this point my under 10.5 golds bet is a gambling lock. if it makes you happy ill be depositing my winnings into bank of america. #usa #usa
TheCousinSal,the committee will never exclude the big 10 but i still think 1 loss bama would be a better choice than 2 loss ohio state. that massacre  shouldnt be overlooked. the badgers can make this an easier decision next week.
12Xpert,stan james (god rest its soul) were notorious for trying to hold a price (advertising). but i still managed to get them to move by an average of 8.4 percent  which was much bigger than their margin for these bets.
12Xpert,i calculate a 9.26 percent  yield from 3467 bets avg odds 4.39. p-value is 0.05 relative to an expectation of -1 percent  (rough estimate based on your clv). bayes factor is 160. they're strong signs that clvh isn't correct here.
12Xpert,i've put together my main leagues data since 2016/17 so basically since the book was published. just a straight comparison betting colder teams versus betting hotter teams. odds are pinny closing with margin removed (log function). t-test p-value = 0.015.
12Xpert,"so  that is  pretty close to using the harmonic mean.

yes when you forget to copy/paste the table values it can get pretty annoying if  it is  a memory intensive simulation. or did you find another way to do it?"
12Xpert,that is  correct. seems to me that if you know what you're doing with bog they'll ban you anyway so taking 2 percent  on the exchange is surely a good option. the alternatives are 5 percent  and 8 percent .
12Xpert,there are lots of things that chip away at family budgets. going to the cinema sky tv going to football games flying in planes. smoking drinking. some are socially harmful in excess. some environmentally damaging. what's morally special about gambling?
12Xpert,i would be reluctant to say that these profitable intra-sample subsets are anything other than data mining and luck but one can't rule out the possibility that you might have more ability at some kinds of bets than other kinds.
12Xpert,"4 midweek main leagues game playing (1 woc): 

this weekend is easter and lower english leagues play friday/saturday with another round monday. data for the first lot will be available saturday night. fixtures for the second will be available sunday."
mschwimer,its the exact opposites of what touts do. if vegas dave offered me +230 on identical terms im offering i would bet at least $1m into that. but no tout has ever backed picks up with money except for us.
mschwimer,"correct. we have a units calculator on our site. you put in how much you want to bet and it gives you the result of what will happen based on how we do. full transparency! 

we recommend $300 per play."
mschwimer,"agreed!  cizzle deserves a gift. i tried to dm him but he is un dmable. 

so back to the point. why wouldnt you put your money where your mouth is? or do you not believe a single thing you say?"
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  mention any specifics regarding pay. machine learning is great for some specific things.  it is  not great to use nothing but machine learning to build an entire model imo (as your results have clearly shown)
RufusPeabody,"u.s. open longshots i like (prices from dk):
morikawa 750/1 80/1 t5 33/1 t10
saunders 750/1 100/1 t5 40/1 t10
schniederjans 50/1 t10
carlos ortiz 50/1 t10
nick hardy 100/1 t10
bremner 150/1 t10

also like cantlay +450 t5"
RufusPeabody,regarding  and their wd policy i want to clarify that i wasnt tricked in any way. they told me up front. i was just kinda dumbfounded is all. also want to thank them for raising my limits. much appreciated.
RufusPeabody,"updated pga win probs:

RufusPeabody,against square line? i  daily fantasy sports  know the exact number but sure. but we're talking about a two-way market and as soon as you start betting underdogs and unders at bovada the square line ceases to be available.
RufusPeabody,what im saying is there are not people out there worth fading. im sure there are a few ppl hitting 45 percent  over a large sample of picks but thats not because theyre 45 percent  fundamentally; its entirely randomness.
SportsCheetah,the brandon ingram devin booker tj warren and gordon hayward lines of the last two nights are eerily similar. cant recall that even happening on that type of shooting  percent  last season let alone 4 times in two nights.
capjack2000,"first be aware that the tn lottery wants you to list the section paragraph and subsection you are commenting on as well as the page number that section appears in.

capjack2000,"greenwood doesn't want 50 percent  of the revenue from a book that would compete with a property they get 100 percent  revenue from. 

greenwood should be stripped of their licenses if they  daily fantasy sports  intend to use them."
capjack2000,"i think fading jennings who admits he's not as sharp as he was when he did his run is a solid approach. 

rutter is indeed a live dog but holzhauer's congnitive speed is unmatched here. smart money on james."
capjack2000,"not counting rhode island's february 2019 (where they booked all ne action) having a losing month on football ( college football   nfl combined) is almost impossible. 

i  daily fantasy sports  know of one occurring in the last 20 years."
capjack2000,you dont have to make picks every week. you just make 70 picks between now and the end of the season. a lot of people seemed to try to pick every game on the schedule in the first week.
capjack2000,dk pays affiliates ~$300 per referral. dks signup promo is worth about $250. while most recreational bettors might not take full advantage of that signup deal im not adding in advertising costs. id say $550 is a light estimate.
capjack2000,"i disagree. platforms like this one are shaping the american conscience and lifting the veil that has blinded the recreational bettor. 

by educating the bettor we are pointing out the glass ceiling in hopes of eliminating it. 

america  europe."
capjack2000,from what ive heard the new app will replace all of their existing apps. it remains to be seen if wh stays in pa though. their operator was penn gaming at hollywood and they are switching to kambi in-house.
capjack2000,could be. i didn't have $50k on it though. i'm fairly confident the offshore i bet with at the time didn't have even $5k liability on that prop. what kind of sicko bets on 1 pitch of a game?
capjack2000,"again another blog post item here that i'll make into a twitter thread because i feel this information is needed to be disseminated more quickly given recent developments.

RASPicks,contrarian to what?   it is  not like all of the sharps and all of the public are always on the same sides?  to me  it is  not far from the thinking that vegas has sucker lines and trap games.
VegasRefund,if you need to buy points then do you really have enough confidence in that play in the first place? and if youre doing it to justtt be safe then gambling might not be the best fit for you.
ProfessorShine,agreed.  but i think this was a prime opportunity to make a show where new bettors have to catch up.  i dont see any entertainment value being lost if the show featured     and let them all hash it out.
ProfessorShine,it is ridiculously easy for  to mention the promotion but also mention the negatives to it.  if not it is just free marketing.   i cant even say darren is only one doing it hes just most visible right now.
suuma810,"the #chargers called four first down runs of which three went for 1 yard or less. two punts followed on long third downs.

they are now down 7-28 and will probably complain about not getting their run game going."
suuma810,you  daily fantasy sports  need a good run game to be good at play-action. his own qb just proved him that by going 7/9 on play-action attempts for 9.8 ypa last week vs 7.6 ypa on all other dropbacks.
ClevTA,fyi for the first time this year ive got my nba database up. cavs have faced the toughest schedule in the nba based on net rating. top 3 off and def faced schedule this year. they should win tonight
ClevTA,every time i turn on the espn betting show that anita picks the square dog. are her nfl picks being tracked? would love to know her against the spread record with nfl dogs. i see she picked dallas+5.5  today
ClevTA,agreed. also great break by the safety who knew baker loves to target landry on 3rd and 4th downs. that cant be one of their best play designs right? crossers into each other and no rubs or clear outs
ClevTA,harbaugh is tremendous. ravens fortify their analytics department this summer and now making really smart 4th down and 2pt conv decisions. amazing how that works. pete carroll on the other hand has zero clue when to go for it...
ClevTA,if baltimore had scored on the last play of the game and went for 2 and the win is everyone ripping harbaugh? not saying its the correct decision just saying thats how u have to look at his decision
CizzlingSports,"in first 10 seconds of this vid # worst of all time  says we had a successful winning regular season.

spanky,"i hear ya bud but two wrongs dont make a right.  you took a parting shot. not my style but i can understand your frustration...

the real issue is them limiting you to $25 on nfl which is ridiculous"
spanky,"its a no win situation and its short sighted.  if you want picks theres lots of other follows. 

if you want my opinion on execution and things ive picked up along the way the last 20 years stick around."
spanky,"these protestors stretch the transitive property to impractical levels.

spanky,"for those who attended  hoboken event with  and myself did you guys get anything out of it? honesty is appreciated. saying it sucked is super cool.  

for those that missed it would you consider attending if it was closer?"
spanky,we only look at  mlb moneyline after 10am because we get 10k.  its the highest limit on mlb moneyline on any app in nj.  im interested in seeing what the cf limits are gonna be once the season starts
spanky,getting the best price is more important to me than winning.  if you get the best price and beat the closing line then the winning will eventually come.  having only one out will deny you getting the best line.
spanky,i believe your problem (as well as most gambling twitter) is the inability to speak out positively of others. you put blinders on and just hate hate hate.  god forbid you admit hes a great marketer (which is undeniable)
spanky,open up your donbest screen... starting from the left ask the owners of all the major sportsbooks if im respected.  wait -you probably dont have a donbest screen and you definitely dont know any owners. move on troll #keephatin

PlusEVAnalytics,also magda and the crew  were super nice and super helpful. if you guys ever want to switch your alignment a little more chaotic hit me up. mtg player to pro gambler is a fairly common path just saying...
PlusEVAnalytics,of course this is always the way it was going to happen. either the picks are bad or the picks are good and people like spanky hammer the numbers into oblivion. either way the pick selling industry remains undisrupted.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh for sure its shady and should be illegal. its just not as simple as they took the bet at those odds because in a parimutuel system the final odds are unknown at the time the bet is maxed
PlusEVAnalytics,if you dont remove vig from these implied probabilities they wont sum to 1 across all possible outcomes. if they dont sum to 1 across all possible outcomes theyre not probabilities and they shouldnt be called probabilities. end rant.
aluckyaday,but does a 38 game stretch ensure you play everyone twice? and have an even number of home and away games? as the teams and schedule change each year some 38 game stretches will be more difficult than others.
aluckyaday,very true. its a question of management. much easier to manage a single reduction factor across all markets than try to have individual limits on a per market basis especially when you are taking thousands of bets per minute.
aluckyaday,has anyone run a sim of what they are offering? even with the edge claimed what is the chance they have to pay out at the different levels? no one is immune to variance. have you simmed it  ?
aluckyaday,i guess that is not democratic the people might not want it. in fact that is probably the reason why the leave campaigns are funded by the people they are. can not have the workers bettering themselves can we?
aluckyaday,"interestingly the eu is little more explicit about its objectives. the eu is ""not merely an economic union"" but is intended to ""ensure social progress and seek the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples"""
aluckyaday,looks like i could have got it wrong today. if not  it is  going to be a stunner  there were 8 on the shortlist. out of the 4 i eliminated 3 have run already and all 3 have won!
aluckyaday,blatant attempt to win over the dup without whom his government will collapse before it is formed. another case of boris saying what he thinks people want to here without having a credible plan on how to achieve it!
aluckyaday,i thought he had said he was targeting stages not gc. if that is the case then not much chance of a podium. maybe he has changed his mind? must be tempting with the loss of froome and dumoulin.
aluckyaday,i think  betting mentioned a nice rule of thumb in one of his pods. if i remember correctly his idea was you should be aiming for half the bookmaker margin as your level stakes yield. or was it double
aluckyaday,or maybe its about brand awareness. i would think the brands that  daily fantasy sports  have a high street presence would be at a significant disadvantage when trying to recruit new customers if they could not advertise on tv.

joeyisaks,you charge what customers are willing to pay... hes good at marketing. dont think someone who sells picks/ works for pick sellers / affiliate links should bash someone as you are basically the same when u work for tan
EdMillerPoker,"it is  not just a man selling picks.  it is  a man with 8 figures of backing selling picks with the stated intent of ""disrupting"" the industry. and disrupt he will i believe... and not in the good way."
EdMillerPoker,tl;dr: i'm gonna be an active participant this football season on twitter answering your questions about in-play betting. ask me what you want and i'll answer to the best of my knowledge. if this interests you here's my suggestion.
EdMillerPoker,there's an inflection point effect. just as a thought exercise think about if the uk market ran at a -3 percent  hold for the entirety of 2019 (ignore who is footing the bill). what would that do to handle?
EdMillerPoker,1. we've built the sharpest in-play nfl odds feed that exists and you can watch it free and in real-time on our website. we're demoing one nfl game per time slot including all standalones. email sales for login info
GolcondaFund,depends on situation but an already limited offense becoming less dynamic means more predictable. well rounded team in general but they play tight games as is. losing a big 3rd down catch or deep threat could swing a game.
GolcondaFund,"patriots 0
browns incompetence -17

just mind boggling how religiously consistent one team is over the other. they all get paid the same and went to similar universities. yet somehow - one has the mental capacity of a shoe."
nonrandomalpha,altho anecodotal this a common narrative ive been hearing...the market is not fully off the chargers yet but certainly are on the titans even tho they have a clear upgrade at qb. gimme titans even sell points to -3.
nonrandomalpha,cowboys werent consistently getting aggressive passing the ball down field until they were getting blown out - in other words until the game forced them to. context matters. how aggressive are cowboys when the score is within a possession?
nonrandomalpha,grier was easily the best gators qb since tebow and franks has stunted an otherwise talented team. franks has ego without substance. he plays terrible and then bails himself out with a single good series and a lucky win.
nonrandomalpha,i wouldnt say slander is the gator way but it may be the gainesville/florida locals/townies way. there is a huge distinction between uf students/alums and gator *fans* - the latter mostly being the ignorant uneducated vapid breed of representation.
nonrandomalpha,agreed the target of the comment was hasty and overaggressive but the substance of the comment is still true and accurate; most so-called sharp betting shops are short the #browns based on historical precedent myopic thinking and shallow contrarianism.
nonrandomalpha,the public consensus' portfolio in wk2 of the nfl preseason included big positions in the  +  both paying off nicely leading the public to go 10-6 earning a nice 27.5 percent  profit on an average bet size of $188.75/game.
nonrandomalpha,i refuted your implication that jackson was as effective with winston as with fitz through empirical evidence. whether or not he's building meaningful rapport with wentz is not conclusive. we can argue opinions or we can argue with data.
LeeSharpeNFL,"wait does this mean washington is going to fire their gm but hire a new coach before hiring the gm?

honestly i wonder if we're going to move to an nfl world where gms start reporting to head coaches."
LeeSharpeNFL,"it really feels the  producer really hates the bears. they probably  daily fantasy sports  actually but it feels that way.

between the 2017 draft and double doink references it feels like we're being trolled and aggravated for no reason."
LeeSharpeNFL,"for the purpose of this analysis if the only difference a team could do was 3 vs. 4 or 5 vs. 6 they weren't considered to be a team that could ""improve their seeding"" and weren't in the sample."
LeeSharpeNFL,here's my model's leverage for each team that can still make the playoffs in terms of the impact of their own game this week (chances if they lose in week 16 vs. chances if they win in week 16).
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah. and of course the model should be made public before teams start scheduling games and the like. if the model is too game-able it can be changed. but at least everyone knows the qualification and seeding rules upfront.
LeeSharpeNFL,agreed. when i first read your tweet i was thinking about tom brady and was going to disagree but then i saw the quoted tweet and that made me realize you probably meant prospects (and for those i agree).
LeeSharpeNFL,"stylistically blough actually does remind me of aaron rodgers.

- good at extending plays
- free play awareness
- is very risk averse
- likes to make big plays/go downfield

but he's certainly less accurate and not as good."
whale_capper,started a small pool if you want to bet on who the top 5 consensus in the superconest will be...  daily fantasy sports  need to get the order correct but you get more points for getting the top teams:
whale_capper,i would recommend you open accounts at every offshore book and use bitcoin to move money from book to book as needed... the prices options and utility at the offshores is such that they all have advantages and disadvantages
whale_capper,cheers man would very much like to cover p2p exchanges but were us folks so ive never used one and im not sure when well get access to one with high liquidity but would very much love that opportunity

JoeyKnish22,if youre a religious man id suggest some deep prayer. if not ive got a meeting the with hawaiian boosters club this week to see what we can cook up and how much paying off the officiating might cost.
JoeyKnish22,i tailed on the no yang giveaway. like that a lot. no opinion on obama think 3.5 is a sharp number. hunter biden  i do not know  i see the logic but if hunter is said potentially some controversy.
JoeyKnish22,"undefeated sec champ alabama
undefeated acc champ clemson
one loss b1g champ osu
one loss b12 champ oklahoma 

one loss lsu 11-1 (say 3 point loss at bama). with wins over texas florida auburn tamu. 

who gets left out?"
JoeyKnish22,i dont disagree with you but the federation wanted results. after the qualifying disaster they were picking a squad to win this not develop youth. his time will come soon enough if he can string some club form together.
TheKostos,the nfl effing up the end of the nfc title game not only deprived us of a brees/brady super bowl but also led to jared goff going into the tank and sean mcvay losing the genius card. not good!
TheKostos,"know a lot of  content lives in podcast form (interviews etc) but the 6-7pm et hour should be live appointment listening/viewing.

tonight    and i will break down all nba big  college basketball  tennis and more leading to 7pet tipoffs."
LockyLockerson,updated thoughts on all of tonight's nba games now available at the patreon page.  i picked every game against the spread yesterday and went 8-1.  so i'm definitely going to hit 88 percent  the rest of this week.  totally.
LockyLockerson,friendly reminder: you do not need a kindle to read the book.  kindle is a free app you can download and when you buy the book on amazon it will go there.  works on every type of phone/tablet/everything.  thanks!
chadmillman,totally fair criticism. growing pains/lack of communication between our editorial team and the best bets team driven by algorithms. we realized it after we released and came up with a plan to make the difference more clear going forward.
chadmillman,"tomorrow we've got  coming on  to talk nfl combine nfl combine betting and more. if you have a combine/draft question you think can stump him (and me and  dm me. 

best one joins the podcast to ask the question."
Gingfacekillah,honestly not too bothered by this one. if harden and paul hit their avg 3pm or even league average they cover the spread easily. some games are like that. reset for tomorrow. missing about 3 3pm or 9 pts.
Gingfacekillah,looks like the public likes det. generally a fortuitous sign. take a peek at bovada and bodog. i'd guess the recency bias is in effect here but the brooklyn nets are not the chicago bulls part i or ii.
Gingfacekillah,i always thought tennis was one of the hardest sports to beat because its so knowable from a forecasting standpoint. individual players each point divided by serving/receiving played one at a time. hard to find an edge. great work!
logan_matthews9,like all gambling its about finding value vs the market. soccer in general is way more volatile than other sports by the nature of just a few moments deciding the outcome but still profitable for those doing it correctly
logan_matthews9,"a few over/unders:
pulisic epl goals - 6
mendez first team ajax apps - 3.5
sargent bundesliga starts - 9.5
players under 21 for sept camp - 8
us champions league appearances (pulisic adams weah ajax guys) - 15"
logan_matthews9,because they werent good enough! thats my whole point. us soccer fans just constantly want the next thing because what they currently have isnt good enough. that doesnt mean whats coming is better it just hasnt disappointed you yet
logan_matthews9,the best gold cup group stage since ...? maybe 2013 but this was probably better. weve dropped points in every group stage except then since 2007. and this group wasnt that easy - it was half of the hex!
logan_matthews9,mihailovic had literally the worst performance ive seen since bornstein in the jamaica game. what has roldan done besides being stared down by holmes for bad touches? sorry this just seems like bradley hate and doesnt have any basis
logan_matthews9,but i think the primary is going to be built around - heres why i can beat trump and ultimately the best argument for that will win. you are talking about an area where biden is polling massively ahead
logan_matthews9,as a final thought im up 6 percent  so far this season. my current crop of clubs that seem undervalued are orlando city and ne revs. overvalued are road favorites (in no league is home field advantage more prevalent)
adamchernoff,"the game i enjoy the most is three rail but rarely do i see a table in canada or the us. 

if im here and by myself i play straight. if im with anyone else i prefer 9. you?"
adamchernoff,unfortunately the majority of bettors would rather look at (or pay for) public percentages instead of understanding bookmakers margins and compare the market as a whole. here is how you can spot influential market moves and understand price moves:
adamchernoff,"new england:

pass o success rate: 10th 
rush o success rate: 9th
pass d success rate: 23rd
rush d success rate: 12th
o line: 2nd
d line: 21st 

extremely well balanced and coached. pass rush is the one weakness."
Ccon8181,really?? 11.5.. thats a lot of value lost. hold off and see if it bounces back. if you can bet in game you should be able to grab a better number. 13 is the worst number id take personally
Ccon8181,"weekly recap: negative week almost to colombia to regroup before back to work.

last week: 3-4 

season to date: 43-43 

looking forward to a slight recharge then itll be a full sprint with football and basketball through next year."
Ccon8181,congrats to  and  for winning the #mnf contest yesterday. ill continue to share the love when i have solid weeks. set your alerts so you get notifications and dont miss the next one. lets have a solid profitable season!
Ccon8181,#fox #fox college football  calling the #stanfordfootball score and cover i think thats a backdoor cover? lol nope probably need to learn the lingo. only people whatching that dog shit game had a bet on it. #stanfordfootball #northwestern #nuvsstan
Ccon8181,between #pac12refs and their phantom holding calls and #stanford hc david shaw calling runs into a 9 man front every first down. ill take them up by 3 at half. letting it ride but recommend buying off a bit.
ToddFuhrman,dont worry not going for 2 became the least of his concerns when they elected to punt from the 39; all in they coached scared late and let the experienced team have a chance and lawrence took full advantage
ToddFuhrman,hank you guys are going to be an interesting test case.  i think a lot of states will be watching to see how a mobile only business model works and what qualifications or operational guarantees are expected from operators
ToddFuhrman,not saying it did or didn't happen but if you're myles garrett and mason rudolph used a racial slur to provoke the now infamous incident why would this not be the first thing you told the media last thursday?

ToddFuhrman,i always struggle with this: did i do more to shorten my life making poor choices between 19-21 or will betting on an ever changing crop of 19-21 year olds do more damage...ultimately i think it becomes a push
ToddFuhrman,"as a huge fan of #stanleycup playoff hockey the current playoff format is outstanding for rivalries and great games in the early rounds but...  

from a competitive balance and reward for a great season standpoint  it is  complete garbage"
ToddFuhrman,we published a reading list on the site i believe two summers ago; a lot of good stuff in there about the industry more than actual technique but all worthwhile reads that help pull back the curtain a bit
ToddFuhrman,"youll never know less about sports betting than you do right now...

take the time to teach yourself statistics probability and market dynamics one lesson at a time and youll be surprised by how much ground you can cover"
ToddFuhrman,they have an athletic advantage in the paint against most teams they play...however that won't work the deeper they go into march when elite teams have big boys to bang down low and duke can't shoot from the perimeter
TheCousinSal,i have to be honest - my tiger to not eagle a hole bet is not looking strong right now. no better feeling than losing a big chunk of change before the kids are even dressed for school. #gambling
12Xpert,please show the source for your numbers.  can show you her source if you ask for it. can you do the same or are just making up a number you want to be true to fit your belief system?
12Xpert,these twitter tipsters dont sell tips. they make money from bookmaker affiliation. it remains unclear to me whether they know they offer negative expectation advice or whether they are blind to it because of young male testosterone driven overconfidence.
12Xpert,"well quite. as several notable individuals have said ""better to be lucky than smart."" i think  would agree. ""luck is the grand equalizer."" presumably in near-zero validity environments with pareto-distributed performance outcomes luck is far more influential than skill."
12Xpert,no because we dont know what the reason is. if there is only one tipster who does this then it makes it more likely that its just chance. if other tipsters are systematically doing this then it gets interesting.
12Xpert,...how newspapers should behave provided the behaviour under scrutiny is within existing law. yes politicians can change the law but when this involves press freedoms including those to offend they do so a great risk. that was my point.
12Xpert,of course you could check whether you're beating closing prices and/or causing prices movements. with softbooks happy to post inefficient opening prices and their willingness to ban customers these movements are a certainty for those who exploit such prices.
12Xpert,not at all. hardly any lie or fake their records. the problem is that almost all touts are blind to the fact that they have no ability beyond luck. to the customer blindness and lying however have similar outcomes.
12Xpert,economically for you it may be priceless data. but scientifically for the community if we can't see it test it and replicate it it has no value.  it is  like some one claiming they've built a perpetual motion machine.
JambosPicks,i am not sure where we disagree on this we absolutely think there should be something concrete.  as you just said a set date is concrete. the package is exactly 17 weeks starting tues 9/3 and ending mon 12/30.
mschwimer,im heading to bed. big day tomorrow. as always happy to have  or  on the jambos podcast.  i personally think the gambling world deserves to hear two professionals discuss in depth gambling content in a professional and civil manner.
mschwimer,then you dont know rufus. he was watching like a hawk and even scrapped our picks to make sure they matched up. he was the one giving us a hard time for using best available instead of market line.
mschwimer,you guys have no idea. almost all our subs are nyc quant hedge fund guys. that seems to be our biggest audience so far. i think they understand what we are doing from a modeling standpoint. but who knows.
mschwimer,my favorite thing about our system is its troll proof. the fact that you wont buy the package proves beyond a doubt that you think we will be profitable including juice over the entire nfl season. so thank you!
RufusPeabody,"ny giants only had yards/play edge of 6.5 to 5.6 in their win over miami. but they improve almost a half-yard on both ends after contextualizing and end up with a ""real"" ypp margin of 7.0 to 5.1."
RufusPeabody,fyi  and i have been discussing plans for  and how much we want to disclose publicly this year. well do *something* but probably not as much as past years. should have a decision in the next few days.
RufusPeabody,first  podcast in 3 week!.  and i have a free-flowing conversation touching on football modeling second half betting and the us betting industry where i argue there is plenty of balanced sharp action the market fails to capture.
RufusPeabody,i think thats exactly what happened here. the argument that they thought it was all irish doesnt make sense since they only priced northern irish golfers. any time i have an edge i deem a number was mispriced
SportsCheetah,with playoff pushes being made in week 14 and the must-win narrative running rampant i investigate 5 games with teams in a must-win spot and assess if the current market is making bettors pay premiums in these instances
SportsCheetah,south dakota was -4.5/5 adjusted as the small dog 2h and the score went final 79-75. then the app inserted a line with 0:00 and the score changed to 81-75 after two made fts with 0 seconds left.

capjack2000,first let me say i'm a big fan of vsin. i've been watching since the first broadcast ahead of super bowl 51. i think they do the best job in providing largely unbiased content in an emerging industry.
capjack2000,"i believe the reference is to people that say ""vegas says the odds of kawhi joining the lakers is..."" and then they cite a line by mybookie. when no legal site offers those lines. 

are you defending mybookie?"
capjack2000,"since he wrote a forward-looking article based on recent past he should also add:

sharp players will take to social media to influence and shape public perception. that perception will force some operators to adapt to new paradigms."
capjack2000,unfortunately we didn't meet. you were a popular guy and i every time i crossed your path you were already talking with someone. you did a great job with that panel today though. i'm sure we'll meet sometime.

dinkinc,okay....  i just want to start with assualt rifles... i grew up in nyc so i am anti-hunting as a sport... seems cruel.. but that is way down the line as far as gun reform goes for me
robpizzola,just under 4.5 points against a league average team but admittedly i think the gap between the two is even larger. falk is so so bad. i  daily fantasy sports  even have words for how bad he is.
RASPicks,why still sell at all?  it has been a considerable asset and it has potential to create opportunities for us that we may not get otherwise.  also some form of selling could someday become more scalable than betting.
RASPicks,"ras football update:

2018 nfl phase 1:  22-12 +8.75 units

2018 nfl overall:  29-25-1 +1.65 units 53.7 percent"
RASPicks,there was a 'constant stream' of negativity on the forums long before twitter existed. most industry operators ignored valid criticisms/comments adhered to minimum standards or none at all and had no interest in honesty/transparency. so here we are.

ClevTA,if osu does face clemson im not sure u can make that total high enough. neither d has faced an offense in the same stratosphere that theyd be facing. any total in the mid 60s would be short
ClevTA,being over the top loyal to a kicker is a red flag. also using a tiny bit of the cap for more depth wouldve been good i think too. at the time they thought luck was still playing
ClevTA,i dont know its monday night so ppl always chase with favorites. also going from 3.5 to 5 typically isnt a big deal bc those are dead numbers. if it was 2.5 to 4 thats a real move
ClevTA,i exaggerated with 100 percent . but i think he gets in. one of the best role players in nba history on one of the best dynasties ever. goes a long way. not a ton diff than rodman

spanky,bullshit bro.  takes 50k nfl sunday.   i will always get that if i want it.  your logic is equivalent to me going to mcdonalds asking for a big mac and them telling me a different price each time.
spanky,"how many mu's do you bet during a regular tournament vs. a major? 
sample size is probably too low to answer but do you hold more at off the wall tournaments vs majors or is it consistent hold?"
spanky,also for clarity this 10k is the win limit not the base limit....ceo told me thats how they do it in australia. so if im betting an mlb +160 dog my max risk is 6250 to win 10k.
spanky,"thanks for all the positive feedback about the podcasts i did with  and bob dancer and my first ever podcast with my man jake   hope you all enjoy. links below.  
bob : 
gwae part 1: 
gwae part 2:"
spanky,every year the nfl is a breakeven sport for us. some years we make a peanut some years we lose a peanut. this year was different.  we had an exceptional nfl season.  hope the anomaly continues next season...
spanky,watching   story time with jimmy vaccaro where  interviews jimmy.  the knowledge and experience  has is unparalleled.  i can listen to him talk all day.  this business is built on the shoulders of giants.   is one of those giants.
spanky,wanna put out a positive post and give major praise to  .  these guys treat me very fairly and give me acceptable limits.  thank you guys for understanding your craft and utilizing my bets to better your business.
spanky,what a complete joke.  when i was starting out there was a bookmaker outta ny. when you asked him how much can i bet a game he replied open the window stick your head out and look up!
PlusEVAnalytics,you give up your right to claim no pressure when you take the job as leader of the free world. they should really add that to the oath of office so that its clear for the next guy.
aluckyaday,unless you want to fundamentally change contract law.... and i am sure you realize that forcing bookmakers to take a bet would be detrimental to the majority of recreational bettors. recreational bettors are their target market not you.
aluckyaday,it is not a problem for sportsbooks running a softbook model. it allows them to offer what recreational punters want and ultimately recreational punters are the ones funding the whole industry the ones you need to keep happy.
aluckyaday,if you say so. at 35 games per year 350 games with a 55 percent  hit rate would occur 3.07 percent  of the time if done by a random monkey. so 1 in 33 monkeys would beat you.
aluckyaday,just an enhanced version of cashout. basically cashing out the old bet and then placing the new bet. paying the vig twice  plus you get their prices rather than the best in the market. another soft book wheeze.
aluckyaday,i would think it does as long as you use the correct odds. a lay bet it just like any other bet except you are betting on a loss instead of a win. i think that is correct
aluckyaday,are you are expecting those companies that current trade with europe to switch to trading with south korea overnight? i did say no deal brexit. do you really believe a no deal brexit is what people voted for?
aluckyaday,i'm not convinced that pinnacles distribution of margin is a simple function of the odds. if your assumption of how margin is distributed is incorrect how much of a difference does it make to your measure of sharpness?
aluckyaday,true in some cases and casinos are happy to play on that with their boards showing spin history! but i'm sure there are plenty that go to casinos without the expectation of winning. hope maybe but expectation no.
aluckyaday,its not really winning that gets you limited its taking value prices. you can win but it has to be through luck. basically a casino model not a bookmaker one. welcome to the world of the european punter!
joeyisaks,punting makes zero sense besides knowing theres about no chance they pick up a 4th and 15. but still against a team that runs well just go for it pprob wont be near the 50 3 more times.
joeyisaks,that math doesnt make sense since you are using a high unrealistic number almost as a cop out/ shows you have no experience actually winning $ from betting bc you dont know how it works getting accounts etc
EdMillerPoker,but most dont even outright close accounts they cut limits and put you on approval. to reasonably enforce a no banning reg you basically also have to enforce same limits for all customers and no bet rejections ever
EdMillerPoker,a fascinating display of symbiosis as the numbers at the end of the handle troll harnesses the blue checks reach to spread his message while the blue check receives sweet sweet audience engagement in return. nature is wild.
EdMillerPoker,we put our kid in soccer when he was 4 and one game as my sons team was losing 20+ to 0 i realized a group of parents had created a ringer team of fucking 4 year olds.
EdMillerPoker,"always amazes me how much positive weight people give to someone who says stuff they agree with.

you know whos 100 percent  gonna say stuff that sounds good to you? a con artist trying to take your shit."
EdMillerPoker,i think theres some obv low-hanging fruit but i dont claim to have all the answers. dks product is obv a business but trying to duplicate dks business while doing everything worse than them is not a business.

so if you got a good pitt pulse i say go for it.
does look to be too many points so good value at least."
nonrandomalpha,fisherman loggers roofers steel workers policeman and fireman miners military personnel and general construction workers are just a few trades that are exposed to more consistently dangerous elements and reduced life expectancy than playing the game of football.
nonrandomalpha,you can't look at these numbers in a vacuum. the context is critical. in many cases ekeler was complementing gordon and taking advantage of defenses that had to prepare for both of them as opposed to just ekeler.
LeeSharpeNFL,people want to believe? i  daily fantasy sports  know that people think nagy is necessarily the problem either but i may be too divorced from bears fandom generally. especially now that i live in seattle and not illinois.
LeeSharpeNFL,this missed extra point is going to cause pete carroll to realize he has to get two  touchdown s instead of trying for  touchdown  + 2pc +  field goal  so honestly seahawks fans should be happy about it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"did it make it more likely in your opinion that they'd score on the next drive?

if yes why doesn't that show up in data over large samples?

if no why bother talking/caring about momentum at all then?"
AndyMSFW,that'd be a hell of a feat especially since we added merrimack and i  daily fantasy sports  know theirs.  i think if you guess bulldogs or wildcats you have like a 10 percent  chance of being right though.
AndyMSFW,since we're back in america and there's actually round by round stats for golf i'll be putting together some r3 plays for wgc  the 'cuda.  but first i'm gonna watch the cartoon spiderman movie and down some gin.
AndyMSFW,i like that.  and i think the thing that gets lost is  it is  very market dependant.  you can't make the same assumptions and measurements when betting into nfl sides as you can betting hot dog contest props.
AndyMSFW,not yet!  but none of my goofing around with it has looked very profitable with back testing.  gonna see how things look once i have some more 2019 data to work with because priors aren't working for me.
AndyMSFW,"yesterday's title games:
nm st.
uc irvine
montana
prairie view
umbc

harvard +360
cincy +359
georgia st. +200

not hedging unless its live/halftime.  a parlay of their opponents would pay 5/1 if you worry about going 0-3 though."
JoeyKnish22,100 percent . really a genius move. younger newer gambler demographic too. feels like jambos made a big strategy mistake even going on twitter. theyd probably be raking if they just went and scooped suckers from ig unchecked.
JoeyKnish22,at this richmond basketball game there was a free chicken dinner if an opposing player missed 2 fts in the 2h. team is up 40 guy on other team missed both from the line. crowd went absolutely nuts.
JoeyKnish22,haskins is the worst 1st round rookie qb ive seen in a minute. feels very paxton lynch. cant move. cant read shit. hes a bust. take the screenshot. nobody who makes it ever looks this bad early on.
JoeyKnish22,ohio uses one of their 2 remaining timeouts left to draw up a 4th and 23 play with 2 minutes left. effectively ending any chance they have if they dont covert. this is the dumbest league on earth.
JoeyKnish22,well time to lower the cut line into the slums dougy. dont let that cheetah schmuck who spends too much time in the makeup room pre-show talk you out of a winner uncle k says pull the trigger.
TheKostos,liverpool gonna have a weird rest of the season. out of the ucl out of the fa cup will probably clinch the premier league in somewhat short order. and then what? a big victory party until may? lol
TheKostos,it certainly has disaster potential. but as a fan i'm more willing to roll the dice with the unknown than sign up for someone i know sucks (like they did with shurmur or would have done with garrett)
LockyLockerson,nba update will be out around 1-2pm and a reminder that full college basketball(!) ratings and projections are up at the patreon page.  excited to get market reaction to all these ratings and start crafting some smart numbers.
LockyLockerson,i never ever use google sheets (i'm an excel person) but i put together a very barebones doc that i'll be updating every day maybe it helps you maybe it doesn't.  a very simple nba spread model. /1
LockyLockerson,busy saturday in college hoops a million games and some nba as well.  come hang out over at the patreon page full projections/ratings of all games and less of my go-nowhere twitter ramblings than you get on here!
DannyParkins,oh get out of here. i loved the signing. he gave an interesting answer.  it is  the biggest story in the sport and he was on the other team and is involved in the signs as a catcher.
DannyParkins,thursday night. 7 hour flight. sleep pods on the chartered flight. theyre fine. the team wont make this excuse so i have no earthly idea why some fans and im sure media will make it on their behalf.
DannyParkins,this is the guy i do  with on sunday mornings on  in case you havent sampled us yet. i dont drink coffee but as you can see i wouldnt need it with  we have a lot of fun.
DannyParkins,absolutely not. and the book is far from closed on mitch. i still believe he can be really good and he clearly was in the worst situation of the 3... but in the here and now it hurts.
DannyParkins,this is the infuriating part of replay even though it benefits the bulls. trae young clearly stepped out of bounds and because the hawks asked for a replay they get it and it slows the game down unnecessarily.
DannyParkins,heres a podcast of the hour where we talked about me becoming a dad and the challenges of celebrating owens birth while dealing with the prospect of a long nicu stay. it was therapeutic so thanks for listening.
chadmillman,this is where it gets tricky with legal betting leagues engaging and asking for fees to ensure fair games. nice work by  going beyond the #astroscheat scandal to examine how bettors are impacted ... now and in future.
Gingfacekillah,it is  been similar up here covid19 is rapidly becoming the singular focal point of most media. law school here just cancelled all in-person classes for the rest of the semester today. hope you're managing to safe euan.
Gingfacekillah,"law school largely involves training your mind to function as more efficient decision tree algorithm for classification.

inputs: fact pattern
chance nodes: areas of conflict
class: probability weighting

2 more weeks of riddles and then back to sports."
Gingfacekillah,"""...a teams winning percentage through the first x games is highly predictive of the winning percentage by the end of the year with the predictive value growing stronger as x is increased (r-squared value for x=15 was 0.63..."""
Gingfacekillah,it is  not the standard elo function. read my explanation in the comments.  it is  a  percent  points share which changes the k parameter range. if you want to change it to the standard elo formula feel free.
Gingfacekillah,ill be explaining one or two simulation models for sure. i may throw some vba content in as well wasnt planning on it but it can be very useful. ill see if i cant squeeze it in there.
Gingfacekillah,"taking a study break. i can't look at rules of evidence law any more today.

reading this (admittedly lengthy) paper:

heuristic trading biases in sports betting markets:
""sports betting from a behavioral finance point of view""



good stuff."
Gingfacekillah,true. however phi is packed with high end shot takers and distributors so if embiid gets into foul trouble you can expect his usage to go down. main matchup against vucevic leans my way. i guess well see.
logan_matthews9,guy picks every side/total for every  college basketball  game but uses the opener instead of currently available. got tracked for a few days and was on the right side of the number over 90 percent  of the time.
logan_matthews9,"this is excellent. this is probably as sharp of a pool as you can get yet overall the group was a massive loser. and this is even against extremely stale lines. great work  

wrong side of the counter"
logan_matthews9,- his sp is fantastic and he freely shares all his picks. hes purely a data perspective which is very useful (but has limitations). on its own theres value. combined with line movements and external analysis its excellent.
PikachuBets,you called me out first so yes i get to ask you a question. now stop dodging the question like a pussy and admit that you didn't fucking realize that fcs closers are softer than your grandma's ass

adamchernoff,"#wildcardweekend video preview thread 

market analysis and handicaps for each game this weekend.

working hard to get better and get the youtube channel moving. if you enjoy the podcast please check out the videos and consider subscribing.

adamchernoff,"this morning is a busy day for bettors placing super bowl futures. here is a reminder to the differences between a futures bet and a moneyline rollover. 

 daily fantasy sports  think the two are the same...

watch :"
adamchernoff,"ok a thread to wrap my thoughts on ""reverse line movement"" so i never have to speak of it again here or on the podcast and can get back to paying attention to the games and betting markets..."
adamchernoff,"""the opening line"" is live! 

each sunday evening  and i will discuss the opening lines as they are released at  with trader insight and analysis. on wednesday we revisit each market and look ahead to the games. 

listen:"
adamchernoff,the interface will show accepted but because youre not betting into accounts the third party brokerage will have to push and process the bet requested. prices can move calls get lost or bets never end up getting placed.
adamchernoff,adjusting for injuries is a key part to nfl handicapping. i created a list of tips for  which you can put into action to this season to keep your pricing and power rankings accurate from week to week.
adamchernoff,sorry some travel had me tied up. all of my thoughts are in the video. as for bets im liking venezuela -0.75 brazil peru u/2.75 and then had a keen eye on some group c stuff later on.
adamchernoff,still probably need at least $1m+ for data feeds developing software certification staffing support and payments not accounting for float (not sure what mandatory minimum is) just to be competitive. good to see numbers coming down though slowly.
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  like locking my money up for the season with win totals but i am in disagreement with both of your wagers. i have the colts rated quite high and see very little in cincinnati.
adamchernoff,"betting should follow these steps:

1.) use method(s) to project probability 
2.) convert probability to price
3.) compare price to available market prices
4.) determine difference between projected price and best market price
5.) stake according to difference"
adamchernoff,#nflwildcard weekend kicks off in just a few minutes. i have you covered with an in-depth handicap and a wager on #seavsdal. lets keep the great regular season run in my weekly  column rolling into the post season.
adamchernoff,"kc: -7.5 to -6.5
no: -10 to -8
ne: -9.5 to -7.5
dal: -4 to -3.5
lar: -4.5 to -3

influential money all going against common bookmaker liabilities early in the week. going to be an interesting sunday..."
adamchernoff,"readers of my blog on  and i give back 1.28x this week with tampa bay putting up one of the more unique performances of any team this season.

the loss today brings my season record to 9-4 (+7.64x)."
Ccon8181,"last weeks recap:

4-5 all a -110 ... chopping wood at 

13-13-2 overall 

nothing impressive about that but we continue to beat the market and the results will show. the proof is in the pudding as they say."
Ccon8181,thanks for checking in jeff. is there a problem if i personally bet each side i advise for a minimum of 5k? seems like id be one of the few who actually have real skin in the game.
Ccon8181,with the way things have been going i guess ill take the push after miss st slept through first half. didnt catch a call down he stretch... still a solid day  on deck. gonna grind out profit today
kellyinvegas,only loser of the 5 was jags over 8 wins. all in all id say a good investment with my money for the season. usually dont enjoy futures bets but these were great. thanks to all that tailed
ToddFuhrman,the overwhelming assumption that the eagles winning the nfc east is now a formality surprises me...this is still the same team that needed last minute heroics the previous two weeks to beat the redskins and giants (at home)
ToddFuhrman,"not sure i've ever seen dallas get less attention from the betting public than they are this week hosting the rams

early indicators (and  it is  very early) showing 9 out of every 10 tickets on los angeles"
ToddFuhrman,well fd is in great shape given their parent company flutter is in acquisition mode; dk would be the company making a ma much more feasible if a pe firm wanted to make a splash in the space

ToddFuhrman,i will admit the variance with bad teams has to be more pronounced so betting just off numbers comes with a caveat ...we definitely see mistakes snowball faster with bad teams than ever before especially in the nfl
12Xpert,here's the annual breakdown. obviously i have slightly different data to nish for 2019. i took out walkovers and retirements with 0-0 sets scores as per pinny rules. maybe a few odds errors in the data set too.
12Xpert,both conservative and labour manifestos were full of of the proverbial  it is  just that the whilst the former smelt like something your dog does the latter smelt like an entire farm yard of shit silage and urine.
12Xpert,"yes you will. i was restricted by many bookies many years ago doing similar things. if you want to make this method pay you will need to learn the ""dark arts"" of keeping your soft book accounts live."
12Xpert,if people vote for use then i'm down with that. the problem is they hardly ever get asked about these things so that kinda reduces representative democracy to autocracy. that was one of the reasons for brexit too.
12Xpert,i've tried all to contact the  affiliate team twice this week but no one can be bothered to respond. your brand really is the most useless in all of bookmaker-land. i mean properly useless. perhaps  should be renamed
12Xpert,anyway i'll let this go. i'm not here to cause trouble for the sake of it just want to educate punters to understand more about luck and skill. time will tell if you have any of the latter.
12Xpert,perhaps i'm missing something here i'm not an addition expert but when i saw the #betregret tv ads this is how they came across to me and i was left thinking 'is that how you would tackle anorexia?'
12Xpert,no i would consider it more a fundamental approach in the sense that it starts with a hypothesis: pinny odds are better than other bookmaker's odds so bet the others when they are more than pinny's plus margin.
12Xpert,using sharps to get better idea about true prices where necessary. the end results would bee that in such a new environment some of the weaker sharps would become squares. betting is a relative skills game like poker.
12Xpert,no real hypothesis as such yet. just looking to see how their model's implied odds stacks up against real bookmakers. i intend to do some more on this over the next couple of days looking at relative performance.
mschwimer,this is a fantastic point you bring up.  i am planning a very long note tweet where i will explain where we are and where we are heading.  will 100 percent  touch on what you brought up above.
mschwimer,"right. if we ended with the units we were down. roughly 6 units down. our 17 week subscribers would be +5200. 
paid 3k for package
lost $1800 in bets
received $10000 in jambos rebate 

total for sub +$5200"
mschwimer,i challenge  or  to take $1m in action as a max per play. i will make 2000 plays over a 17 week period. minutes bet 100000. will you accept? sports are nfl  college football   college basketball  and mlb.
mschwimer,also we dont get to line shop how one normally thinks to line shop because our subscribers want us only books. true line shopping would be international and you could use pinny and other cites with reduced juice.
mschwimer,definitely wiggle room. my advice to get the best line is put them in right when we send. lots of pros follow  so it is really likely the line moves the longer you wait. again these are generalities.
RufusPeabody,this is an extraordinary story not just because of what happened but because of the personalities of the people involved (the three astronauts were besties who drove matching gold corvettes).  (and  with a hell of an episode.
RufusPeabody,but the default view is he was an undrafted free agent he doesnt have the upside. guy was a 5-star recruit #1 qb recruit in the country coming out of hs. never fulfilled his potential in college.
RufusPeabody,can i ask why you have oregon so much higher than penn state? almost identical sos (your calcs) same # of qws penn state has 2 t25ws to 0 for oregon and penn state has better gc.
RufusPeabody,i met berryhorse as well and also really liked the guy. did he overpromise? yeah. was it malicious? no. hes young and has a bright future ahead. he didnt scam anyone. he just had a bad season.
jeffma,making 36 percent  of your threes at that volume against a team that is much better than you is a pretty big stretch. that being said certainly the strategy should be to shoot a lot of 3s
SportsCheetah,theres no real precise way to line that. if you guys can come to an agreement on a price and are wanting to bet with one another roll with that. mahomes deserves to be a big favorite.
SportsCheetah,in the past they've shown more love in ou/big12 leading up to the final week though. i'm holding an ou playoff ticket from before the season so i hope he's right i just think utah is ahead.
SportsCheetah,if you listened to this type of stuff back in the day you may care to check out tracks from a pop punk record my band recorded with ace enders from the early november two years ago
SportsCheetah,2 more college teams went for 2 down 8 today and another went for 2 down 11. all 3 were successful. that last miami one gives them a shot to win this game in regulation here late.
capjack2000,"once you select multiple teams it should show up in the parlay ticket as teaser+ you can select your points you want to add. 

as you see here -143 for a 2t teaser is not exactly attractive."
capjack2000,"lost in the shuffle of legalization is the undeniable fact that sports wagering is an amenity to other higher margin forms of gambling. 

following the nj model should include this synergy or else results will be disappointing."
capjack2000,"who is q sportsbook ( in iowa partnering with for their lines and risk management? 

they chose the igt mobile app software which i've always found to be pretty good. surprised we haven't seen it used elsewhere."
capjack2000,some will be impressed with the rutgers win but i'm most impressed by the targum's illustrator who produced a vivid representation of a game he had never seen before and got it published in the same day.
capjack2000,if you can't make enough of a profit booking nfl sides to cover your acquisition cost you've got a much deeper issue than sharp bettors. you're not even acting on behalf of shareholder interest at that point.
capjack2000,william hill will be releasing a new app soon that hopefully improves upon a product that has never received high marks. nobody has seen the betworks product yet as they havent officially launched in any other state.
capjack2000,"theres a lot of analogies that come to mind. the recreational golfer. blackjack players. cooking enthusiasts. 

theres a large gap between recreational and professional but plenty enjoy pursuing that middle ground with realistic understanding of their skills."
capjack2000,"california probably should wish for federal legislation because i  daily fantasy sports  think they're going to find a solution suitable for both the tribes and the cardrooms. same with florida. 

best chance for federal legislation is 2023."
capjack2000,theres plenty of room for more options in nj. a total of 45 potential licenses are available. you wont see any other horse racing parimutuels though the nj horsemen have a monopoly of that assigned to tvg.
capjack2000,"we dont want consumers to know kambi said max bichsel.

i think consumers should know kambi. we know kambi. dont let them operate in the shadows. im making it a goal for the world to know kambi."
capjack2000,i just wish there was only one form of standard accounting used by ngcb. all these regulatory bodies have 100 percent  of the information they ask for they then choose how much they let the public know.
capjack2000,i feel bad for the guys currently running the underrated caesars bookmaking operations. they have done a very good job at putting out innovative lines. im not a fan of czr but their efforts have been undeniable.
capjack2000,"one year ago today i made my first legal sports wager in nj (no pic of the ticket ). 

heres my view of the opening ceremonies at monmouth park that day. i wasnt there for the crowd."
capjack2000,"with wynn promising to enter the nj sports betting market the list of promised entrants is pretty impressive:
- superbook
- cg
- thescore
- wynn
- 

best of all none of them have partnered with kambi...yet."
capjack2000,"thanks. real question though taylor...with cr you educated the masses (including me) even though you relied on their square liquidity to make money as a poker player. explain that dichotomy.  

(i'm not being argumentative i'm truly curious)"
dinkinc,i respect her but she can't show up in a championship main event and commit to five rounds of avoidance .... she gave herself almost no chance to win by not engaging... very unfair to the fans
dinkinc,joe kelly had these sick unhittable stretches when he finds his groove...  sadly one wonders if he can find it again... the dodgers have some rope to give him since regular season wins are not a priority
dinkinc,you chose to follow her because you thought she works hard and is sharp both of which are true. if you lost you should only blame yourself.  posting something like this is very rude and uncalled for
robpizzola,pretty much sums up my reaction minus the wanting it to be bad part. some good moments and i liked that the episode was heavy tyrion but frankly some of this shit made no sense at all.
RASPicks,there are overlooked benefits to selling plays - i.e. recruiting talent building bankroll faster when just starting out networking etc. - much like there are perhaps benefits to tweeting all day writing articles and hosting free podcasts.
VegasRefund,could careless about the argument in regards to tigers value being shaded due to his name value.. zero regrets if i lose money taking him in every future major and he retires without ever winning one again.
VegasRefund,been to the dayton 500 twice. rented out and rv and camped out inside the oval both times. unreal time and highly recommend it to anyone looking to do a trip with their boys in the future.

ProfessorShine,look at fezz; he twice won super contest last decade is down the last 8-9years too many units to count but still gets acknowledgement from authors and media types.  can i blame people for thinking hes profitable?
ProfessorShine,the betting market is global so the offshores are only illegal for us customers. vegas pretends to be actual oddsmakers while simply doing cut  paste. it isnt the offshores fault the us created stupid laws like paspa.
ProfessorShine,im unsure what the point is. i thought we were comparing good mid-majors vs mediocre majors.  im saying the gap is much less than one thinks. st marys and belmont would be favored over nwestern illinois alabama.
ProfessorShine,why would you hope i have w-l accumulated?  i usually never gave a shit about w-l; roi is sorta more important.    one could brag hes 60 percent  and be down money due to betting favs.    so no.
suuma810,"happy thanksgiving my friends!

may your day be blessed with peace love family and mitch trubisky

we  daily fantasy sports  have thanksgiving but i can watch football at 6.30 pm on a weekday which is pretty cool"
suuma810,"updated #nfl win totals  the implies sos. some notable moves:

#panthers 8.1  8.3 
#cowboys 8.8  9.0 
#texans 8.9  8.6 
#chiefs 10.5  10.7 
#dolphins 4.7  4.3 
#raiders 5.9  6.2 
#eagles 10.1  10.3 
#seahawks 8.5  8.9 
#vikings 8.8  9.0"
suuma810,dont understand why some teams are so allergic to qb sneaks. go 5 wide from under center and you always have a double team in front of you. you wont get stopped with a guy like prescott.
suuma810,"another point that should have supported the #packers decision to go for it on 4th  2:

kenny clark  mike daniels were sidelined with injuries. the chances of stopping the hawks run game on that drive were slim."
suuma810,during the three games without wr cooper kupp (den included as he had 0 catches) the #rams offense ranked 22nd in pass success rate (41 percent ). they rank 2nd in all other weeks (57 percent ).
suuma810,had phi/tb total at 48.5. todd monken is the real deal but also expected eagles to move the ball more efficiently against a bad  decimated bucs secondary. fourth quarter  touchdown  pass on 4th down got us there.
suuma810,grabbed falcons -4 right at the opener. extra rest home opener  line too short. bad matchup for the panthers secondary. losses of jones  neal didnt matter a lot to me because panthers are too limited on offense.
suuma810,"become a more successful nfl bettor:

1. sign up at .

2. get picks write-ups listen to the weekly podcast  use the cheat sheets to your advantage.

3. realize you are becoming smarter  well-informed.

 let us  go!"
ClevTA,and vernon doesnt stink. u guys are making this assumption after 5 gms. he hasnt been great with the browns but he was awesome in ny for multiple years. lets see if he turns it on soon
ClevTA,defense is awful they have zero proven pass rushers. how is their wr corps solid? shepherd has a broken finger and tate is suspended. and their qb is eli for gods sakes. its a 5-6 win tm
ClevTA,wait. sony michel is being drafted after mark ingram in fantasy drafts? just looked at an adp and did a double take. mind boggling. i think i need to put together some fantasy thoughts in an article
spanky,"just found out from the powers that be at bosa that i unfortunately wont be on any panel this year .  

all the dressmakers can breathe easy now.

im hoping another bettor can represent all of us"
spanky,"as long as possible.  many companies still have cobol code they support.  

i tried to pick up python but once i found out white space mattered i bailed.  

im anal about comments and braces lining up etc..."
spanky,"been getting inquiries for radio/podcast/tv. im not a good fit. i cant carry a sports conv on why one team is better than another. i barely know any players. i dont really even like sports

i recommend:"
spanky,incase you missed it  here's the video of me asking  ceo if they ever intended to practice effective risk management and welcome all customers as opposed to kicking them out () or severely limiting them ().  #bosamerica
spanky,respect  and  for dealing -105 for the rest of the tournament.  im very spoiled as most of my outs are from asia where -105 is standard.  believe it or not dealing -110 in asian culture is insulting!
spanky,i  daily fantasy sports  bet that... is 700 respectable? i only bet football and hoops sides totals money lines....  the other guy said he was limited to 50 bucks on one of those which blew me away
spanky,what do        all have in common?  they are not afraid to take sharp action.  they use it to their advantage.  these are the last of a dying breed.   will call them the last of the real ones.
DocBettor,here's a chart of nba 3 point attempts vs shooting percentage so far this season.  is the obvious outlier and i've also labeled   and  but how many of mystery players a through i can you identify? #nbatwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,scheduled to record  this evening. any good ideas for topics? all i can come up with are how do they get the onions to bloom like that and do the toilets really flush counter clockwise down there
PlusEVAnalytics,if your approach to uncertainty in analysis (data quality sample size rookies injuries etc) is i do the best i can youre doing it wrong. even sharp people tend to miss this. in the non-betting world too.
PlusEVAnalytics,when this fails for the same reason propswap is failing (lack of liquidity and an extra middleman who needs to get paid) can we repurpose your slick looking platform to do my closing line value futures idea??
PlusEVAnalytics,its desired but i doubt many pick sellers actually do it. even if they did would it mean much to know that some guys questionable model came up with 60 percent  as opposed to 55 percent ?
PlusEVAnalytics,the difference between +0.01 normal and -0.01 inverted is the same as the difference between +0.01 normal and +0.03 normal. recession signals are not binary things...unless everyone believes them so much that they become self fulfilling :(
PlusEVAnalytics,no stay with me here. yes agreed the closing line is most efficient. one way to profit from that is to find and bet off-market lines. you say youre not doing that. so what do you do?
PlusEVAnalytics,if i didnt already have a position on tor futures id take one now. market seems to be pricing in something pretty close to full strength durant at pretty close to 100 percent  certainty for game 5.
aluckyaday,i think this strategy forms a large part of what  does. hence his need to find betting partners. it by far the easiest way to make money gambling once you have solved the issue of getting on!
aluckyaday,what is the difference between refunding a bet that lost as a goodwill gesture and offering a free play. they are both marketing plays they come out of the same budget and their aim is the same.
aluckyaday,that is how it used to work but not any more. the soft book model proved more attractive to punters. soccer now dominates and the vast majority of punters are recreational placing parlays and same game parlays.
aluckyaday,because price discovery in horse racing takes a long time. you can have public information that is not currently in the price. due to liquidity issues most private information does not enter the market until very late.
aluckyaday,i would say they do  but because we do not have access to their  internal pricing model we can not determine the system being used. any discrepancies appear to be random when using a 100 percent  book.
joeytunes2,i played late this year. so they might not be that bad.  it actually looked like alot worked in my favor.  i had to lay off a few. utah over being one. nebraska over another.woulda crushed 8.
joeytunes2,"no reply over here either.  doesnt seem like there on our side at all. we need a bettors coalition. we have no  rights. they do what they want.  it is  not fair to only take ""recreational bettors"""

joeyisaks,in these mismatches like so miss bama the biggest athletic discrepancy is in special teams so the punter realy should just punt out of bounds every time .. especially if they are trying to cover 40 points
joeyisaks,poker group hit em earlier in week at 5.5  everyone been taking em when they hit 6.5/7 ... its still early but looks good. enjoy stting out. i had bc+4 and under 56 was bummed was called
EdMillerPoker,"music is the weirdest human thing.  a few dozen songs out of the zillions recorded fire off like a massive dopamine flood every time i hear them.

and then like other people dont even like those songs."
EdMillerPoker,"guy who wrote the ticket claimed he 'must have been half asleep' as his defense

i mean does any american read this story and think anything but ""tough shit half asleep guy pay that man his money!"""
EdMillerPoker,fair.  for what  it is  worth  in my circle round here the amount won is called win and hold is used the way i use it but i know others use hold in the way you describe.
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  dink this is a quirk of a specific backend software package used by a number of nv books. you'll see other quirks in how those same books book pregame over the app.
EdMillerPoker,"once we see improvements with data quality and broadcast latency i think having an ""up between plays"" product with a special focus (e.g. higher limits bigger menu etc.) on timeout periods will be the way to go"
EdMillerPoker,imo this is not a useful way to try to find value. the market changes too much over time. the bad assumption is that a game lined -3 in 200x would also be lined -3 today etc.
EdMillerPoker,this is a key sports betting concept  for what  it is  worth . which bets are good or not depend as much or more on the size of the error bars as on your modeling point projections.
EdMillerPoker,"in-play holds are usually in the 5-8 percent  range... ofc they should be a good bit lower than that since in-play lives and dies with volume

the article makes a fine point and the headline is dumb."
GolcondaFund,lol it got so bad you a non believer think god will bail you out. you know you do not have to be president. you can walk away and more than half the country would be thrilled.
GolcondaFund,spoiler - nfl east preview being released soon taking early look at season totals market perceptions and hidden value.  that is  not the spoiler  it is  eagles finish with just.....wins.     and get #bears #patriots #seahawks at home.
nonrandomalpha,"raven posts bullsh*t tabloid nonsense to appeal to spineless simps ""bush did 9/11"" autists and perpetually nervous boomers. i encourage his ridiculous provocations which manipulate his followers into dumping assets on the cheap. i drink their milkshake."
nonrandomalpha,you should also benchmark your total return performance v industry alternatives. this relative performance is huge when advertising the efficacy of your strategy to potential subscribers. we do this and not sure why all do not. cheers!
LeeSharpeNFL,"if you take his statement literally yes. the way  it is  said implies to me that arians thinks there's a decent chance that it is decisive. 

if you  daily fantasy sports  read it that way fair enough."
LeeSharpeNFL,"yesterday mitch trubisky had his second game above league-wide average for a qb in terms of epa/play against a bad defense.

despite this the bears beat an opponent running their 3rd string qb by only 4 points."
LeeSharpeNFL,my team's producer at work is defending the seahawks overtime punt on the grounds that a tie is not that bad of an outcome for seattle and i have a feeling  it is  gonna be a day.
LeeSharpeNFL,how many teams have a better backup qb than trubisky? is putting the over under at 10 insane? i  daily fantasy sports  think it is. (though i  daily fantasy sports  think driskel is necessarily on the list.)
whale_capper,yeah pats d overall could be wildly inflated due to poor quality opponents so far but over the last 16 games gilmore has been a standout in a dominant unit and his flexibility/versatility elevates the whole defense
whale_capper,should have been more clear... the key point was the uncertainty around the wins is much broader than the price implies to sell a half win or a win... totally due to small sample size i believe
AndyMSFW,this is where you see the limitations of a pure pythag calculation.  seattle is playing like a 9-7 team according to pf and pa but already has 10 wins though 12 games (which is more than 9)
AndyMSFW,everything i got down on this week: a couple early numbers from sunday a winner from thursday () and of course this morning's teaser.  good luck to everyone today even if you bet on the jets. #nfl100
AndyMSFW,"11 takes it down!  10 finds the board!  
i might regret betting the favorite but she hasn't lost all year so i'll make some small ticklers:
ex box with key 4/1510
daily double r10: 4 r11: 9"
AndyMSFW,i love this teaser more than i love my children and will be adding it to my card.  in the extremely unlikely case that it doesn't cash the kids will regain their spot in the power rankings.
AndyMSFW,the jaguars have an elite defense and brought in a huge upgrade at qb.  with the luck news they should think about trading for a wr right-the-fuck now and bring the afc south title back to #duval
JoeyKnish22,"folks. they have arrived. the green jacket of bowl pool attire. more legendary than the stanley cup. more prestigious than a hall of fame jacket. 

the first ever #knishinvitational championship t-shirt. to the victor goes the spoils."
JoeyKnish22,not hating on the play but oregon has the best trenches ol and dl of any p12 team and its not even remotely close. i wouldnt lump them in with the rest of the conference as soft.
JoeyKnish22,also. you can claim up to 10 hours (solid explanation tweet by this gentleman lol) of reimbursement ($25/hour without providing any documentation). so it should be $325 without much effort if people fill out the form properly.
TheKostos,maybe its the vodka talking (spoiler alert: it is) but i really appreciate all the cool people i get to interact with #onhere. the good people far outweigh the trolls and assholes. i appreciate all of you.
TheKostos,just about ready for football to end. have had enough of having my ass handed to me. lol. most frustrating football betting season for me in a long time. thank god for fantasy winnings. bring on hoops

LockyLockerson,fun fact: 5dimes currently has about 100 players listed with odds with the nfl mvp this year.  the team with the most players listed? denver (6).  no that doesn't make any sense.  but  it is  kinda funny.

DannyParkins,also fits the sec culture perfectly. he ended the 3rd quarter with something along the lines of if you have anything in your life that would keep you from watching the 4th quarter i would seriously reconsider...
DannyParkins,i need to get a car. most likely a midsize suv. maybe certified pre-owned. maybe a lease. wife got a new job and now has a commute. priority is safety driveability bang for your buck. any suggestions?
DannyParkins,this profile barely touches on deshaun watsons family/personal story but its the most in depth thing ive ever read about his brain and football obsession. great read on one of the faces of the nfl going forward.
DannyParkins,wow another 3rd and 3 handoff call from matt nagy. this time from the plus side of the field in field goal range. we knew hed be more committed to the run but that one surprises me.
DannyParkins,getting going nationally  and sirius 206. tons of nba to get into but i wonder if anyone can dispute this fact: lebron james is the most powerful player in the history of the nba. 855-212-4cbs. listen live:
DannyParkins,was rose worried about his brand working out alone in the cleveland state gym after his fourth injury? how about when he played for the league minimum? no two situations are exactly identical but this is ridiculous.
DannyParkins,"reporter: was that ball that kris bryant misplayed in the sun a byproduct of not playing the outfield often?

joe maddon: it was a byproduct of the sun. whoever put it there i was really upset with."
DannyParkins,last 4 to this saturdays #whitesox game near washington  clark on the chicago temple sign because why not? if youre near downtown come grab some free tix and get a jose abreu bobble head saturday night. go!
DannyParkins,good luck to  doing the play by play for the cubs today on  theres not many people who can say theyve had that opportunity and i know no bigger baseball fan who appreciates that more than spiegs.
DannyParkins,you listen to me and tweet racist stuff all over your timeline and i have enough money to assemble the crib for me and i need to get a life? got it. have a good one pal.
chadmillman,"i really can't believe mgm sports book allowed us to come up with this promo for new users in nj. but it did. 

bet $1 on 49ers at +49 ( that is  right) and you win $200."
Gingfacekillah,"well since you'd have total and spread numbers (in addition to prices):

fav= 0.5*[total #]+0.5*[absolute spread value]
dog= 0.5*[total #]-0.5*[absolute spread value]

not much here to discover w/r/t value in the nba as its a straightforward calculation."
Gingfacekillah,you can extend this spreadsheet to calculate totals/puckline spreads as well. left these elements out of the download so as not to overly complicate the example sheet - but i would encourage you to experiment with it.
Gingfacekillah,well with the accompanying download link in the book i've already built them for you. with fairly straightforward adjustments with respect to changing the data/team names/prices you can adapt the models to almost any sport you'd like.
Gingfacekillah,this remains one of my favourite articles on building your own team rating model. of particular note is the mapping function - how to attach an arbitrary rating to a target outcome like expected win  percent .
Gingfacekillah,yeah true! i  daily fantasy sports  play  daily fantasy sports  but i've got him penciled in at ~15 (not fp) points tonight in 25-26 min. he'd be an under pick for me because of the blowout potential.

logan_matthews9,because they cant do anything with it. i guess this is a hot take but the us has too often abandoned basic defensive principles in the past against poor sides and its bit them in the ass
PikachuBets,imagine being such a degen retard with an addiction-addled brain to jump through this many hoops just so you can fire some $50 negative expected value bets to lose money. everyone in this article needs help pronto

PikachuBets,buying air jordan 4s for the cool retro look is a far cry from the modern-day fervor over every new players' personally branded shoe. the marketing and branding is off the charts than when i came up

adamchernoff,well said. dont over sauce season smoke or heat. the lower the better and you can always wait more but once its hit with heat you cant go back. thats going to be great when its done.
adamchernoff,willing to put my team pride on the line vs  team pride come sunday. stakes are simple i buy 3 beers per point on a vikings win he buys 4 beers per point on a jets win.

kellyinvegas,i played western michigan. thats the thing with bowl contests. you have to pick weeks in advance. more info comes out after and your plays are frozen. im not betting all of the games on the  graphic
ToddFuhrman,i  daily fantasy sports  think fans in vegas realize how lucky we were to have a hof'er between the pipes to start the franchise.  been a treat watching him live so many times the last 2+ years
ToddFuhrman,i wont venture a raw number because it becomes such a broad stroke given sample sizes etc but id say no more than 1.5-2 percent  from big time operators ive talked to that track all players history
ToddFuhrman,that shouldn't be the approach at all if i believe something should be priced much higher than -200 why shouldn't i tie up funds?  stock market rarely offers that kind of return for a 6 month investment
ToddFuhrman,so you found that a well played high level approach? the half was garbage and even  implied as such at halftime laughing at the term interesting. there was nothing sharp crisp or compelling about the first 45
ToddFuhrman,kyle that shouldnt be the case if you bet into fixed odds pools which it sounds like you did. parimutuel bets obviously adjust based on track odds  but this number should be locked innbarring any unusual stipulations
ToddFuhrman,ha  it is  only when i see them raise the banner or collect rings it bothers me; the actual winning i can't take anything away from them for the product they've put on the field since 2004

12Xpert,here's the 17 bets i place with stan james over 1 week some years ago before instant account closure. can you spot why they did it? clue:  it is  not because of the large number of wins.
12Xpert,"bottom line: all ""winners"" are paid for by ""losers"". when we start to moralise about bookmakers and their profits and the salaries of their ceos we should always keep this in mind. financially speaking gambling is zero-sum."
12Xpert,but then isn't that an admission that one can only make money in lower liquidity less efficient markets? and if so who is paying for that? certainly not the exchange  it is  other punters who are losing.
12Xpert,unless you happen to be thinking and modelling like the bookmaker and happen to be targeting lines that the bookmaker is intentionally taking positions on. then closing line value may not give an accurate measure of ev.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  know what the yellow line actually is. it looks far to erratic to be expected profit based on closing line value. but perhaps it is. just hoping nish can confirm what it is.
12Xpert,this is just a mirror image argument. if you could be deliberately bad then you'd know how to be good. worst = unlucky which are normally distributed. 99 percent + of pyckio tipsters are in that distribution.
12Xpert,unfortunately i haven't ready it and  daily fantasy sports  know much about high frequency trading in sports betting markets. it will certain add volume and i would imagine it increases efficiency.  is probably the guy to ask.
12Xpert,i changed my data source so  daily fantasy sports  have those easily available. i would always urge people to run their own woc analysis if they are following this method anyway since pinny odds may have changed.
12Xpert,i also like to remind people that cheating is ultimately self defeating with the cheats consuming themselves. game theory has proved this unequivocally. for social creatures engaged in competition  it is  much more effective to play fair.
12Xpert,"ha 
which? sbc or ? either way no one should block you for just doing that. thats suggestive of lying to your customers.
ive done a follow up to this thought experiment for next months pinny article."
12Xpert,log method wont be good for racing. 2 or 3 way only. for multi runner events the shin method is better. im sure someone reading this can post the link to his paper i cant remember it.
12Xpert,how about another market: brexit will never happen. the only way it will happen is if eu gets sick of it all. as always they hold all the cards at least until their house comes crashing down.
12Xpert,if the code says gambling shouldn't be linked to enhanced sexual attractiveness the you shouldn't be promoting your brand with deals who are obviously attractively above average.  simply  daily fantasy sports  use images of people at all.
12Xpert,the most obvious example of this is the favourite-longshot bias. but screwing people who like longshots doesn't imply those who back favourites will make a profit at least not these days and certainly not at efficient bookmakers.
12Xpert,just checking in with  are we seeing some mean regression or just bad luck? i could be the current history 1 in 6 times by guessing (was 1 in 9). are you planning to return next season?
mschwimer,you will see it very clearly. i promise you. just needs to be part of a conversation to get the point across most effectively. i have nothing to hide from. twitter just not the avenue. thats all.
mschwimer,you have my cell.  call me and i will explain.  too long for twitter.  it is all math.  i am available right now.  you can record the conversation and post if it to twitter if you want.
mschwimer,precisely! if we talk about how good we are we get slammed. then we say if you dont believe it short us. then we get slammed for not talking about how good we are. gamblingtwitter is beautiful.
mschwimer,after all the bad beats this week does  get the luckiest win in best bet history? over 27.5 dame points. wins by a hook in 4ot! in fairness he didnt take a -135 game like i did.
RufusPeabody,i think its possible. you just create an interface for market takers that looks like your typical sportsbook. has price on each side that includes commission as well as limit (volume of offers) for each side.
RufusPeabody,can i ask why you're retweeting this entire conversation? what is the legal recourse? and do you really think most people can afford to take the time and pay the legal costs necessary to pursue it?
RufusPeabody,yass: putting up props (such as will coronavirus cancel ncaa tournament) have added benefit of giving us a better idea of true probability  also would allow people to hedge. (obviously would need to be true markets)
RufusPeabody,i'm disappointed as well.  reached out to me about speaking thinking i could promote the bettors advocacy nonprofit    i are launching but unfortunately he was told cappercon didn't want any affiliation with the american bettors coalition.
jeffma,we criticize non-analytics people when they try to critique analytics because they dont know what they are talking about. you are entitled to your opinion but im telling you that my opinion is you are wrong.

SportsCheetah,from  the wizards' e field goal  percent  was 73.6 percent  the highest in the last 35 seasons by any team in a loss.  digging further back but for now it appears to be the all-time record.
SportsCheetah,burrow loses in an ugly game at bama tua is hurt hurts already lost + ou probably not winning it 3-straight. feldman just put out an article polling a group of voters and young was #2.
SportsCheetah,plans/graphics/scripts for certain games. ive nixed games in the past when they go completely out of range but like i said i still think bulls over 224 or better is a worthwhile bet in this case.

capjack2000,i consider  to be a real us bookmaker. the lines originate elsewhere but the bookmaking spirit is strong  fair. they take the same limits from all players and  daily fantasy sports  shy away from a bet.
capjack2000,"interesting fact caesars e-mails include an html callback which then logs your players card number so they know when you're looking at their emails and measure their effectiveness.

dinkinc,that video was excellent.  can i suggest a change for you.  give up preseason football. nothing you can learn from it. handicap del mar or start watching pwg wrestling youtubes. the latter is a life changer
dinkinc,i was very close to having a 1-7 exacta but decided on using the 5 instead of the 7.....  not sure how an owner would want to ride him since this is par for the course
dinkinc,"here's a train of thought i didn't see coming..... ""hmm so  it is  sale vs dillon peters.... what's the best way to extract value out of this..... i guess angels first five innings ""   go figure"

dinkinc,mistake on prior post on the h2h.  2-2 minus one unit.  thanks to the   horses for the correction. i limited it to the four i liked best which messed everything up.  my apology to those confused
robpizzola,that roughing the passer on the raiders was an awful call. if theyre going to allow pi to be reviewed might as well extend it to roughing the passer because they get half of these wrong.
robpizzola,if i am ever seated in zone 5 i volunteer to check my bag for that very reason. others should have the courtesy of doing the same instead of cucking the rest of the boarding line.
robpizzola,i think the accusation comes because of the mentality of the person that is adamant they are right when they are absolutely wrong. if he hadnt double down on his stance hed probably get less hate.
ProfessorShine,whats your end game here matt?  because if its as some kind of gambling guru youre off to a rough start.  nobody reads gambling news; at least at tan you have a chance to fool people.
ProfessorShine,yes i watched.  his genius is being allowed to lie a lot for financial profit.  he lied more here and new bettors wont get the difference. ive already seen tweets asking whats the problem with vd.

ClevTA,of course. and this analysis has zero context to who was the qb on the other side. u arent punting to maryland here its the #1 pk on a title team who was getting the ball.
ClevTA,who besides pouncey is out? he will be back by then bc the gm is 4 weeks away. allen on the road against that d is trouble imo. they obv need juju to recover in time
ClevTA,i  daily fantasy sports  even care about the money part of it he's going to get a lot of interest and good deal after the jets signed him for peanuts was the main point of it
ClevTA,why does a 5th round pick have to be used in the draft? vets are being traded left and right for mid to late round picks. also used to move up in drafts. its an asset
CizzlingSports,"a fine point here eye know but look at this elementary nonsense - record starts sliding so  let us  add in the pushes to try to make it look better lol

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"i do not know  maybe bc he didn't publicly post all of these sooper seekrit winners from last year?

he did post playoff pickz tho and oh wow look what happened

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"yes the fee for the 17-week package is $3000.00.

from 9/3/19 the start date of the 17-week package through 9/20/19 the service lost -12.19 units.

$300 is the recommended bet size. $300 x -12.19 = -$3657.00."
CizzlingSports,"in other words he chased the line move by picking bal +6.5 in the stale line contest after a liquid market  all over his monopoly money kc -6.5 pick

so sharp # worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,some1 with a nose for profit pls explain what it is abt darrel that drives ppl to buy sooper seekrit betting info unless the object here isnt actually selling garbage but something else entirely oh wait
CizzlingSports,the issues with big league advantage the insufficient t'sc's the illusory nature of the guarantee and all the problems  pointed out re: the past records all showed up in my research  for what  it is  worth
CizzlingSports,".hi  can you pls ask  for an on the record comment about whether  it is  a conflict of interest for an alleged +ev sports betting information vendor to receive affiliate money from sportsbooks?

thanks in advance"
spanky,"i dont even try betting those promotions because i go in on a short leash to begin with.  

even so my limits on college were cut to the low hundreds so i had to leave ."
spanky,also  next time you get back door access find who made the call to lower my limits to nickels and eventually kick me out.  i understand its a business decision just wish someone would own it.
spanky,this is true.  without losing players sportsbooks would not have excess money to pay guys like me.  i just cant believe that theres so much left to go around for touts to also make a killing....
spanky,i have no idea what he does thats his business.  what i do know is bill has been a pro for years and does not need to sell picks.  he is well respected in the industry.
DocBettor,not a promo or anything just sharing what i thought was a good product experience. if you  daily fantasy sports  care about the betting data and just want to have the scores i would recommend flashscore.
PlusEVAnalytics,if you really want to get offended they used to give married under-25 males a discount compared to single under-25 males. been a few years since ive done personal lines so not sure how prevalent anymore
PlusEVAnalytics,its a simple logical fallacy. bad bettors lose so fading bad bettors should win. bad bettors dont win 50 percent  of the time they win 0 percent  of the time because theyre bad at this. #fooledbyrandomness
PlusEVAnalytics,"the 12th worst team in the nba is the hornets heat or pacers. they are mediocre.

in the wnba they would be the best team.

the wnba needs to improve. 

(see how dumb that logic is?)"
PlusEVAnalytics,suppose nba totals were 5 points too high for games played on even numbered days and 5 points too low for games played on odd numbered days. your chart would still look the way it does.
aluckyaday,the other issue with scaling it is the variance. the maximum drawdown for my selections over the 3 years i have been doing it was 446.6 units. so it would require a sizeable bank to scale.
aluckyaday,ok its a distribution rather than a number. but a number that will cover 95 percent  of possibilities would suffice i'd prefer 99 percent  and 99.9 percent  but as you  daily fantasy sports  believe in luck....
aluckyaday,yep but i  daily fantasy sports  think people being able to profit off his loss is a sustainable model! he is losing punters are losing where is the money going to come from to pay out?
aluckyaday,the european model is a little different though. the books want to keep the recreational dollar for themselves rather than share it with sharper punters. ironically this is a good thing for the true recreational punter.
aluckyaday,personally i believe anyone who resorts to insults instead of reasoned argument is the dense one. but i'm so dense i must be wrong. then again rufus did like my reply so likely he got it
aluckyaday,my personal rules for anyone that tries to follow me... do they have protected tweets - blocked. are they selling something i'm not interested in - blocked. do they engage in twitter conversations? if not blocked.
theFirmAISports,yeah plus that game wasnt overly exciting. i love this concept that youre going thru. ive always thought about doing it but never have the time. when you finish the analysis id love to see it!
joeytunes2,this guys a clown. i originate and work with guys that are good. me and jerr work togetherwe do plenty. ill say it again books use automation. when they book by hand ill bet by hand.
joeytunes2,been trying to reach you please have someone in upper management reach out to me. will give you number in dm. i would like to make this situation private but your not leaving me much choice
joeytunes2,i agree with you ed. would never preach. i hate losing for partners. rather lose for myself. no one ever gets something i dont have money on or what i believe to be the wrong side.
joeyisaks,when you are 67 and $ isnt an issue 12 million is just a number sanity is more valuable and it was taking years off his life ... he can get whatver ncaa opening he wants
joeyisaks,would be great if instead of game they had some sort of memorial service for fans to come to and a tribute to him? i know fans were lookin forward to going just for that aspect
joeyisaks,its tough bc we think hed want the games to be played but he was also only 41 and has plenty of friends former teammates still in league and have to respect their grieving process too
joeyisaks,was nice to see someone win a dr pepper challenge last night actually trying to throw the football none of this 2 hand chest passes. any sites offering totals on the dr pepper challenges today  ?
joeyisaks,well the answer is make a guard fall in love with you.. so why would it be diff for wanting to commit suicide / im sure having it be a murder made helps life insurance stuff
joeyisaks,so whats the solution? 10 year contracts are crazy. 5 years for harper/machado 165 million seems like a great compromise not saying theyre depreciating assets after 5+ years but things change not just in baseball terms
EdMillerPoker,well in a way they're right those are the big costs.  it is  a chicken and egg problem. they can't build a good product without the good pricing. they can't project what's not yet built either.
EdMillerPoker,"wrote a little thread about what makes our in-play nfl lines different than what you'll see at your favorite sportsbook.

as usual if you have any questions please ask away. i love talking about this stuff."
EdMillerPoker,once youve made the bet and gotten to the point where youre thinking oh shit i bet too much then you do what you gotta do but you can def avoid that situation with some foresight
EdMillerPoker,tweeting in my experience women dont like sex and then having 70 bazillion ppl respond lolol u just suck at it bro self-own is the best way to market gambling how-to books in the year 2019
EdMillerPoker,agree. theres a widespread fallacy that public sentiment plays a major role in market pricing and in exceptional cases and markets i think it does but in the vast majority of everyday markets it does not.
EdMillerPoker,"i  daily fantasy sports  know all the best ways to parent kids but i do know that every layperson asshole who's got all the answers on how to ""raise kids right"" is completely full of shit"
nonrandomalpha,like wow henry ford was moron could only invest the shitty model t couldnt even come up with 400hp electric sports car. fuckn dumbass. elon musk is obviously a superior human and visionary than henry ford.
nonrandomalpha,hmm...i wonder why. on bk to bk road games out west/east both the saints/niners (respectively) made alt accommodations and seems to have contributed to strong road performances. car  az car  tx is a lot of travel...
LeeSharpeNFL,"what is the goal?
what is the stat?
what is the biggest strength over current alternatives?
what is the biggest weakness over current alternatives?
how predictive is it?
where do the bears rank in this stat?"
LeeSharpeNFL,hmm  that is  what i would think too. i  daily fantasy sports  have a saved query for this by expected points added but it looks like seattle has had *above* average fumble recovery luck this year.
LeeSharpeNFL,last year bears got flexed into  sunday night football  when they had to play the early thanksgiving game the next week. kind of unfortunate but the nfl is always gonna lean toward ratings over schedule fairness.
LeeSharpeNFL,this is why i  daily fantasy sports  criticize pace for picking trubisky but do criticize him for being so confident he wanted trubisky that he gave up two 3rd round picks to ensure he got him.
LeeSharpeNFL,"amazing that the rams probably kicked that field goal figuring with a minute left in the half they would at least go into halftime down ""only"" 15 points..... and then the ravens scored again before halftime."
LeeSharpeNFL,"friends around here that i'd watch football with would ironically just yell ""boooo tony romo booooo"" whenever anything bad happened to the cowboys that was in no way romo's fault. he was great and very underrated."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this replaces sea/phi. i think gb/sf is better but both are fine games.

enjoy chi/lar in week 11 though which is didn't get replaced because of the size of the chicago and los angeles media markets."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""momentum"" is a measurement of whether success on the past several plays is predictive of success on the next play. this is measurable with known data. the answer is no (once you control for other factors)."
AndyMSFW,"i can't believe it took until this morning. they must have had a short meeting to see if they could spin this somehow and decided that going with ""he was hacked!"" wasn't going to cut it"
AndyMSFW,"i want to fade the raiders in their 3rd straight road game but can't get behind the bears' offense so...
raiders team total under 17.5 -125 (lowvig)
(hat tip to  to helping me see the light)"
AndyMSFW,i was using a local at the time and we had nearly every other client on the other side so we were cheering together.  it was a sobering loss.  he lost much more than i did.
AndyMSFW,"everyone needs to calm down!
there are perfectly good reasons to
-not bet their own picks
-not believe in closing line value in major markets
-not understand how books balance action
-use all caps that often"
AndyMSFW,"sunday in detroit
round 4  plays
brian stuard over sungjae im +130
brandt snedeker over charles howell iii -120

hope malnati can keep it together i've got a +400 top 20 bet riding on his ass."
AndyMSFW,as i stand at the moment i'm up a little more than 2 units over the 10+ weeks of my golf betting career.   all things considered that could be a lot worse during this break-in period.
AndyMSFW,you might have better luck with a rolling moneyline bet or 3 leg open parlay on their ml's than that.  honestly now that i'm saying it i might end up with a better price that way!
JoeyKnish22,i dont blame you for being naturally skeptical and would agree thats the right approach on the front end. but ive met dozens of people through twitter i work with book with share accounts with etc.
JoeyKnish22,the grinch stills christmas from knishyclause sorry about this if you tailed. and by grinch i mean the stupidity of the average heisman voter. i cannot believe young got 20 first place votes and fields 6.
JoeyKnish22,if you sent me a dm about getting in late i apologize the pool filled up quick. have just under 300 entries to process which is more than we originally planned not looking to take anymore.
JoeyKnish22,this is a rufus question/passion. i still record my personal stuff in excel. recording plays in an app is 1) more work/double work for me 2) i dont want/need/care for ppl to see all my plays.
JoeyKnish22,its fluid. books change risk managers change operations change every book is different and books change as the leadership changes. so it really depends i cant answer that as a blanket statement. its not black  white.
JoeyKnish22,the game has been over legislated. too many rules too much subjectivity too many reviews. it takes the instant joy out of a big play because youre always on edge waiting for a flag or review.
JoeyKnish22,funny story. the most closing line value ive ever gotten on a goy was 2017 a  preseason tip on western carolina +44/+43/+42 vs north carolina. unc had a completely disastrous season. iirc game closed around +23.5/+24
JoeyKnish22,on the flip side. one of the least surprising things of the weekend? me losing more money on east carolina as you sucker me into backing holton ahlers for the 8th ecu game in a row.
JoeyKnish22,remember his entire run was complete before it started airing on tv so his competitive advantage game strategy (buzzer timing daily double wagering) was not public knowledge to the contestants he was facing at the time.
JoeyKnish22,final later today. plenty of hedge possibilities if youre into that. dont hate a cheap peru +1.5 as is. think this will be much more competitive than the group stage game. scene should be absolutely bananas.
LockyLockerson,lot of talk about cfp rankings and thats all fun stuff.  but honestly i dont care at all as long as they get the last one right.  make liberty #1 now dont care. its tv fodder.
LockyLockerson,10/31 overnight nba projections and analysis are now up on my patreon page! a 3-game slate on halloween.  appreciate any and all support.  sign up if you want to sweat/handicap basketball this season! (college and pro)
LockyLockerson,if you do power ratings for college hoops (and are done) curious who the #1 rated mid-major is in your ratings? doesnt seem like a very obvious one unless you love gonzagas reload or memphis potential.
LockyLockerson,kc-oak:  thinks a case can be made for the raiders and he's smarter than i am so he's probably right.  but i have it kc -8.5 and if i see a 7 i may play it.
LockyLockerson,"widely-available things i've bet for saturday chapter 1.  have i mentioned i love this week?

12p indiana +17.5
12p west virginia +7
12p temple +6.5
12p pitt +17.5
12p arkansas state +33.5
1p air force +3.5"
LockyLockerson,bal-mia: my win total projections liked baltimore a fair amount and miami is tanking so it kinda makes sense i'm off here?  i have it baltimore -9.8 market is 7.  let us  bet the ravens too.
LockyLockerson,"afternoon window adds:

330p illinois-uconn under 59
330p central mich-wisco over 54

would also love a 7 for ucla but none available at the moment for me.  we'll call that a lean at 7.5 nothing major."
LockyLockerson,we've done 2 exercises similar to this throughout the season.  i ended up (not planning ahead of time) picking michigan state as the champion both times.  eli picked seton hall and...i forget the second time.  kentucky?
LockyLockerson,kansas but the difference in quality among 8-9's actually makes the simulations pretty wild.  if you swap some teams around in that game specifically (like going from texas tech to wisconsin) it really mixes things up.
DannyParkins,case in point pr wise: you fire the coaches after the press conference. thats weak and makes them look like scapegoats as you werent willing to publicly defend the firings. totally unnecessary way to do business.
DannyParkins,i get why this is a bad look i do. but in fairness parking at bears games is a real pain and if you had a hookup to get around that fact you'd probably take it.
DannyParkins,this is one of those #cubs games that feels a little bigger even though rationally you know its not. darvish is rolling the giants are playing well and they need a road win. im locked in.
DannyParkins,what an epic last night of #scorehouse i cant wait to do the ask me anything video tomorrow morning poolside. leave any questions in the replies and marvel at how much leftover apple pie we have.
DannyParkins,ask a question get an answer. i didn't make the decision to replace your favorite show but feel free to take your anger out on me 11 months later online. at least you like my voice.
chadmillman,we've got a new radio show coming to  beginning 4/29 at 9am. really excited to work with this new partner and for the talented  crew to be heard by even more people! get your calls ready.
chadmillman,ironic since i spent the first part of the podcast explaining this would be the year of kindness in the millman house (i'm the only one complying). but i appreciate you listening to the second half!
chadmillman,i am indeed taping w/scooch at the orleans at 9am vegas time tmrw (wed.) if we get more than five people to show up we will do a live pop-up pod. plus buffet after on me!
Gingfacekillah,dalvin cook u88.5 rushing yards against chi rush defence was one of the easier spots of the week. we'll see if minutes makes any adjustments or continues to go down rushing 54 percent  of the time.
Gingfacekillah,some games are like that. time to stick a pylon in the net and play post post crossbar. cant really laugh though...a center that averages 8.2 assists a game has 1 after 3 quarters for me....lol
Gingfacekillah,"submitted to international journal of forecasting jan.8th 2019 very current work. the author ultimately finds that adding the odds to the forecast improves it. bill benter was right it appears.

""exploiting sports-betting market using machine learning"""
Gingfacekillah,less efficiency in nfl pointspread markets than nba markets. my thinking is that this is due to the increased randomness/ decreased certainty of football.  240 games in this sample se of 12.87. #nfl #sportsbetting #nflbetting #sharpaction
logan_matthews9,to your point (and the articles) it would be really dumb to base decisions off 4 games and not a 34 game season. but theres no denying having a good wc will artificially increase someones value

adamchernoff,as bad as the ne schedule has been theyve played well in each. ten is a big step up from average but its strength on strength in that case. most difficult opponent for ten this season.
adamchernoff,happy new year. playing a bad schedule does not make a team good nor bad. performing against those teams does. in the case of tennessee they have played well below average against an extremely east schedule.
adamchernoff,"on with the guys at the top of the hour talking nfl week 17. 

for those without siriusxm the tunein link at the bottom of the tweet works really well - especially for those in canada."
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  know the answer to that but guessing by the pace and scoring of nba (especially in 2019) i would think any nba tease would be among the worst bets anyone could place.
adamchernoff,"nfl week 14 was exhausting...after a quick six hour ""nap"" overnight  and i are back looking at week 15 opening point spreads/totals  insight from the traders and one bet locked in with a total this morning."
adamchernoff,this will be my twelfth season betting or booking the nfl and i have made (and still do make) tons of mistakes. here are some of the most notable ones i wish i knew starting out.
adamchernoff,"the simple handicap daily previews continue on apple  spotify with the falcons. 

will dirk koetter revert to 2012? 
how does an o-line built for zone blocking adjust to a power scheme?
issues defending in nfc south?"
adamchernoff,once the projected hits for each team vs pitching is determined park hit factors are applied to account for the stadium in which the game is being played in to produce park adjusted hits per game.
adamchernoff,cant put one single factor on it. used got use netypp but i have gone away from it the last year and a half since it became exceeding popular i feel the market has caught up.
Ccon8181,i own losing weeks... it happens all about transparency. it sucks but its part of the business. but its time for a nice solid run. some nice sides set up for the weekend. ready to feast
Ccon8181,i mean what happened boehiem pulled howard about 3-4 minutes into 2nd half in a one possession game got at him on the sideline and didnt reinsert him as the game got away from cuse... garbage
kellyinvegas,depends. i know people who use them to get down more action. regular parlays have one of the highest holds in vegas. rrs essentially just break down your parlay into smaller segments which includes your payout.

ToddFuhrman,the hoosiers continue to be a casualty of unbalanced scheduling. interested to see how the offense looks but i think asking them to get 6 wins for a bowl bid not an unreasonable expectation at all
ToddFuhrman,52.4 percent  assuming -110 is a break even scenario; if you have good money management and hit 55 percent  annually you're able to turn a very healthy living obviously relative to sample size and staking factor

12Xpert,analytics companies presumably make these forecasts for fun and entertainment. however for customers of this entertainment it still begs the question why  daily fantasy sports  they just look at a bookmaker's odds for a better prediction?
12Xpert,the population demographic is ageing aspirations are rising health care costs are increasing. if you  daily fantasy sports  have massive immigration  it is  just completely impossible to fund all of these from 5 percent  of people.
12Xpert,a long read. when cryptocurrency meets ponzi a familiar story of the exploitation of cognitive bias: greed fear (of missing out) ego defence and denial (that when something is too good to be true it is)

12Xpert,if you want workers rights vote for a uk political party who will win the argument about them. if they  daily fantasy sports  win the argument you and they will have to try harder next time.
12Xpert,well almost no punter is sharp enough to ever be a winner at a sharp book so i have to cater for those who aren't and still use other bookmakers. bet365 is the best of them.
12Xpert,live betting will likely be harder for nearly everyone to beat because of the inferior margin but for a small few there may be superior opportunities compared to pre-match because of the greater scope for inefficiency.
12Xpert,gambling is about divining or gaining control over an unknown future. arguably the drawing of cave paintings tens of thousands of years ago was a means of story telling used to divine the prospects of hunts.
12Xpert,much as i admire djokovics talent as a player he lets himself down with his gamesmanship in an attempt to disrupt his opponent when playing poorly. neither nadal nor federer made any complaints about conditions. #rolandgarros
12Xpert,if that were true then no one would bother to turn up to a 6 nations match or champions league match or any athletics event or frankly pretty much anything beyond the level of village cricket.
12Xpert,not a hope. teams/players/managers get figured out by other teams/players/managers who then change what they do. there is simply too big a gulf from the top 6 no matter how bad arsenal and man united are.

RufusPeabody,i'm bearish on patrick reed closing this thing out today. only have him at 27 percent  to win much lower than the guys at  (37 percent !) and lower than the market as a whole.
RufusPeabody,eh i disagree. i dont think they have better models because they the people with the best models can make more money betting them. this coming from someone who worked for oddsmakers for a year.
RufusPeabody,you  daily fantasy sports  have third-party verification. your company purportedly hires a third party. but you can't reveal the name of the company and i haven't seen anything from an outside company confirming your record.

SportsCheetah,the right side is the one that outplayed the other and in a sample of infinity will turn a profit. being able to decipher that  win or lose  will help make future projections/predictions more efficient.
SportsCheetah,"nice nugget from  just now on daily wager. 

luka doncic is no. 1 in the nba in  field goal  percent  out of pnr no. 2 is shooting 51 percent  out of pnr... who is it?"
SportsCheetah,on low volume and forced russ into 7-29. if mclemore/tucker/house/rivers dont bang 20 3s it works. maybe they all had better than average looks though but id be curious to see that play out again.
SportsCheetah,again go ahead and prove i'm 31 percent  on the show and you have yourself a free 100k. take screenshots of this so when you have your proof you can blast the internet with it.
capjack2000,its bad. this new bill giving mobile to the lottery is not going to pass. too much influence by the seminoles on legislators. seminoles want mobile. fl will never be a competitive market for mobile.
capjack2000,"i have por -2.5 / o231.5. felt good with that until the lillard news flashed. feel worse knowing you're on the other side. 

hey at least there's a scenario where we both cash all bets."
capjack2000,"at a time when everyone is remarking njs success in online gaming heres something they do incredibly poorly that other states can better. 

crossover marketing between bm and online is extremely weak. heres why...

1/3"
capjack2000,"the reasons one would play on a different poker account are far more nefarious than the reasons a sports bettor would. 

again  let us  address what would cause a sharp sports bettor to do so."
capjack2000,"letting sportsbooks dictate tc that setup favorable loopholes for themselves is a bad precedent in legalized markets. 

it is exacerbated by policies which force skillful players into a position of having to violate tc.  8/9"
capjack2000,"i know asking bettors to do addition and division is a big ask but salami bettors are probably tired of being rained out. 

 you can do daily avg * calendar day to keep it spicy."
capjack2000,"sometimes the power of twitter is scary. i make this comment earlier and later receive a note that the vig has been adjusted. sure enough a more standard 30-cent vig on derivatives now  

impressive right"
capjack2000,i dont recommend this strategy but ive seen it done. park him in a stall in the womens bathroom for the couple mins. neither security or surveillance would notice a child alone in the bathroom.
capjack2000,parlay-only offers something for everyone if done right. the high margins can let books allow sharp action to balance liability. books can offer open-spot parlays. sharps then have effective single-game wagering books have parlay margins.

dinkinc,0-1 today for the   horses.... just went to get something from my rent a car and went face to face with a skunk... likely someone telling me about my baseball opinion the last two weeks
dinkinc,i never take offense when women post pictures of attractive wrestlers... with the race track they advertise by posting pics of good looking women... we have so many more urgent problems to get through first
dinkinc,he was close to trump.... you would think he might have shared this info with him a long time ago but i guess he was saving it for a better time than the past election
dinkinc,more about the guests who  daily fantasy sports  gamble for a living and talk about trends and motivation.... i wanted to get on to plug   and talk gambling theory...did give out a winner as well
RASPicks,got slightly different numbers close enough but even though house edge on each individual side is slightly lower in the soccer game the fact that there are 3 options makes the total house edge greater.
VegasRefund,fantasy owners proceeding to let us all know how bad of a beat this is for their fantasy team as they were only down by x amount of points (screen shot of their box score).
VegasRefund,making nfl draft player comparisons with guys who wear/wore the same number needs to be outlawed. easily my most unreasonable pet peeve. just saw rashaad penny being compared to thomas jones. they both wore #20.
ProfessorShine,shes been a fraud for a long time and her gender means little.  she also has a history of fat shaming other women and making fun of dead people.  you dont like it block me.
ProfessorShine,i believe it is possible for the hosts to be well-enough informed that they dont need to have on sales touts from shady sites. their competition is based on these guys; go the other direction.
ProfessorShine,youd usually be right matt and if you noticed i only point out fraudulent salesmen of picks and how they shouldnt be promoted.  if you assume i didnt post plays for years youd be wrong.
ClevTA,yes. u should start rivers imo.  for what  it is  worth  i am in a title gm and am starting rivers over jameis and tannehill if it makes u feel better that we are aligned
ClevTA,yeah for sure i know why. im just a laughing bc ppl act like bc they think one way or use their own criteria that that opinion is what the committee thinks. its all arbitrary
ClevTA,i was really just wondering out loud if they are going to continue to be the 85 bears or are they going to just be a really really good defense the rest of the way
CizzlingSports,i guess we'll see if he keeps the loosing pickz entirely behind the pay wall this season - must admit aside from not selling pickz at all  it is  a smart play given the results

spanky,"had an awesome time at  1.  did a great job setting it all up. the whole joint chanting chinese mike chinese mike was legendary after  delivered on that round of drinks.

till the next one"
spanky,i doubt any of the shops down there would reveal their location let alone process an in-person withdrawal.  it took me the better part of the last 20 years to be welcomed as an insider.
spanky,even if there isint much play on the other side in that specific joint these copy cats will stay in line with the market and you would know if there was any resistance world wide.
spanky,we used to have a guy shoot dice at a vegas joint (which will remain nameless) so he could get astronomical limits at the book.  it lasted a good month before he was cut down
spanky,i'm happy to report  has taken my best punches. only 3 shops in nj welcome my action  and   please sign up with them twitter heads so they will have excess money to pay me  #meanbuttrue
spanky,speaking from past experiences the monday before the super bowl is a good time to settle or cash out with your local/offshore bookmaker.  this time next week some bookmakers may no longer be in business.
spanky,from my perspective college football betting ended on saturday. sure theres conference championships and bowl games but nba and college hoops take center stage.  the weekly wars are over. the daily battles have just begun.
PlusEVAnalytics,this would be so hard to price. im guessing whoever made that bet knows what theyre doing. some kind of asymmmetry in the distribution such that bal -26 is much more likely than mia -17.
PlusEVAnalytics,sorry my friend you are way out of your domain here. belief is a continuum not a single point and anyway how are you supposed to figure out whether its 2.5 or 5 by guessing?
PlusEVAnalytics,hey  - the point by point data on your github i see an archive file that contains 2011-2015 and a current file that contains most of 2017. is the rest available anywhere? thanks so much!

aluckyaday,same as each country in europe. different laws different tax regimes. nothing new for the european books. they will pick and choose the states to operate in the same what they pick countries in europe.
aluckyaday,ok. are their limits higher and margins lower than pinney? or is it just because it is easier to bet with them than pinney? be it pinney or cris the effect would be the same.
aluckyaday,yes but the customer is watching a stream that is delayed. you will still have the problem of bets being rejected because they thought they were placing a bet during a break and they weren't.
aluckyaday,if anyone wants to calculate the above figures (especially the infinite monkey number) for a tout or even your own record i have an excel sheet to do it here. based on  yield distribution calculator
aluckyaday,just the uk's four main leagues. as i'm backing them in multiples lower prices are preferred although really big prices  daily fantasy sports  occur that often in the uk leagues anyway. designed to look recreational
aluckyaday,what chance dqs run a long lead out until the uphill bit then stop allowing gilbert or stybar to shoot off the front? will be interesting to see how they line up from 3km out.
aluckyaday,not sure it was his point of view. it was his way of trying to regain control of the party. but what he thought was an odds on gamble went the way of the outsider!
aluckyaday,i've always worries about killer sports lines never been able to find when they are taken and from which books. not convinced their collection methods are very consistent especially over a long period of time.
aluckyaday,a good theory is something that can't be disproven. ask anne elk or einstein even!  that is my theory it is mine and belongs to me and i own it and what it is too.

joeyisaks,i have 20+ plays a day. impossible to tweet them all sorry david those 5 plays didnt win but your profile says you are a pro so you are fine and get the business right
joeyisaks,the one part i disnt agree with you gil today was saying many gamblers are single bc they wake up at 4am. finance/hedge fund employees wake up then too. thats not why gamblers are single
EdMillerPoker,like one of my subpoints here is that you cant assume there is latent demand for some derivative product because there is demand for an equivalent derivative in a financial market with a real underlying
EdMillerPoker,and naturally they bet the errors and then eventually get limited. but that same guy would still bet without the errors. hes not betting only for the errors he just cant help but notice them.
EdMillerPoker,"i'll be returning the favor when his book ""how to win so much money on a gameshow that the producers negotiate a buyout that pays you out longer than bobby bonilla's mets contract"" comes out"
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i can probably count on one hand the number of people qualified to estimate within an order of magnitude the value of a piece of in game sports gambling ip
EdMillerPoker,yeah agree tho i think the industry falls always into the trap of the steep prize structure/jackpot first place formula which gets people in the door great but in the end sucks for longterm retention/engagement

GolcondaFund,"best ending to sports ever:

brady goes to tampa

bucs v pats in sb to decide who the og of the pats dynasty really is.

or both miss playoffs ?"
LeeSharpeNFL,we certainly track line movement but in practice we have to solidify our picks midday friday and there's usually more movement between then and kickoff then between line publish and then (ignoring major injury news).
LeeSharpeNFL,bills wisely down 9 after the  touchdown  go for 2 now instead of waiting for another score. if you're going to need a 3rd score  it is  better to know that earlier rather than later.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it is  hard not to imagine this game as the chi/lar playoff game if not for the ill-fated double doink.

i think the bears were more likely to win that one than this one though."
LeeSharpeNFL,probably somewhat less but not necessarily. bears signed mike glennon before drafting trubisky. broncos signed joe flacco before drafting drew lock (granted 2nd round but point remains). washington signed case keenum before drafting dwayne haskins.

logan_matthews9,at this point it seems as though his system just isnt realistic to implement at the international level. to your point he needs to pivot to a new idea but seems uninterested in doing so.
logan_matthews9,funny how two years ago it was morris who everyone wanted to start instead of jozy... then they realized hes limited just like everyone else. the pool just isnt good yet thats not berhalters fault
logan_matthews9,the score with just a few minutes left will have a massive impact on the decisions made in the remaining time. weve all caught that late run in the wrong direction. anyways back on track...

ToddFuhrman,they're already out there and exist in exchange format; perfect recipe for low stakes bettors but not scalable in a sharks and minnows model so most companies won't make this a real priority long term

TheCousinSal,4 yards at full speed is about 3/8ths of a second. jump forward a few frames to see church turn his body and gronk lower his head. but only if you want to be fair.
12Xpert,i suppose you need to know about how to translate odds into probability and other things like margin and favourite-longshot bias so  it is  easy for the uninitiated simply to listen to opta et al.
12Xpert,"blind spot bias: blindness to our own ignorance.

self serving bias and fundamental attribution bias: basically same as illusion of control - underestimate randomness particularly when we are winning less so when we are losing."
12Xpert,so in addition to my level stakes yield calculator i've now built a percentage stakes bankroll growth calculator to show the distribution of possibilities for particular betting scenarios. with percentage staking returns are log-normally distributed.
12Xpert,i know i know. as a red i just cant help enjoying your civil war. good luck tonight. youll probably win coz like last season we have more important trophies to worry about eh  ?
12Xpert,which all reminded me of a talk i saw at the bluedot festival in july entitled polar thinking. if people learnt to think like dr tamsin edwards  society would make better progress solving these problems.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  doubt that. as with tipsters though most are blind to their own absence of skill and when a forecast comes good they erroneously believe they had something to do with it.
12Xpert,i've not written an article but did post this about 10 days ago regarding wisdom of crowds for extra leagues. if pinnacle are not as efficient then this is probably a consequence of lower liquidity.
12Xpert,preliminary investigations into performance of  soccer ratings against closing  1x2 betting market. sample 18105 league matches from 12/08/16 to 10/04/19. 538's model finds 21915 'value' bets. yield is -5.95 percent  (blind betting -4.38 percent ).
12Xpert,and frankly i think it says all these sports forecasting groups are utterly pointless and self serving (which is probably what taleb would say of nate) since a sharp betting market does a better job.
JambosPicks,"we address the bankroll question on the  faq page which was posted before the site went live. go to the faq page and find the question: ""what kind of bankroll do i need to have?"""
mschwimer,first i have immense respect for bills mafia. incredible fan base and great city. i lived their when i played for aaa buffalo. second everything we do is model based. it is not my opinion.
mschwimer,i am most certainly not a sharp.  i  daily fantasy sports  create the models.  our team does.  it is why i named the company after them and why each of them is an equity partner.
mschwimer,bottom line  if you believe one single word that you say give me 1 single reason why you wouldnt accept the 2.3-1 odds that we are offering you? just one reason is all im asking.

RufusPeabody,completely agree with this. see my tweet from yesterday. but at this point there is still a half remaining and youre behind enough that you shouldnt be minimizing variance at the expense of ep

RufusPeabody,blocking critics on twitter is not 'right' or 'wrong' per se. people can use twitter as they see fit. but the notion that people are only blocked on twitter for bad behavior is false.
RufusPeabody,my week monday woke up at 9:30am worked on golf till 3:30am (only breaks were for food and a quick workout). today: woke up at 9am been working on more us open stuff since.
RufusPeabody,on the left we have chiefs moneyline -120 at the wynn. on the right we have mahomes mvp odds of -150 also at the wynn. and you know someone will probably lay the -150.

capjack2000,"biggest news story today that nobody noticed:

new hampshire not only goes live in one week(!) but the age to gamble on sports in new hampshire is 18.

live free or die i guess."
capjack2000,"they also said six months ago that draftkings was going to buy sbtech...

...still waiting...

...and i'm sure they would tell you the deal will be announced any day now if you asked them."
capjack2000,"other states are being added but the attention to nj seems the most comprehensive so far. 

i've been impressed and i hope it continues to evolve.

solid thumbs up for this effort so far."
capjack2000,"start with these four books probably in this order. i'll warn you now none of them provide an exact recipe:
logic of sports betting 
sharp sports betting
conquering risk
statistical sports models in excel"
capjack2000,i support betting exchanges but bettors need to realize they would be swimming with sharks. im in favor of exchanges where bettors cant make markets for significant amounts. leave that to dedicated market makers.
capjack2000,"there was a time when i wouldn't go near ac on a weekend because it was just too crowded. traffic everywhere. gaming tables packed. restaurants overbooked. 

 that is  no longer a concern of mine."
capjack2000,the app is purely the work and trading skill of gvc a european monolith of sportsbetting.  daily fantasy sports  think of it as betting in ac against the borgata but rather betting in europe.
capjack2000,scoop straffon on the case again...we know that full house already teamed with churchill downs (betamerica) and smarkets. looks like there will be two more partners shortly. one in indiana and one in colorado.
capjack2000,"short-sighted rfp clause for an emerging industry. nh's tax rate by negotiation is another questionable choice. given that they've already projected their tax revenue there's not much of a question it'll be ""very high."""
capjack2000,"i realize when running a one-to-many relationship you can't craft different rules for each customer. however bookmaking is built on balance. 

sometimes a warning is all that is necessary to keep a balanced relationship."

they didn't accept."
capjack2000,while the decision to keep it private was  to make i will say that  and i both agree that we're more likely to share quality information given this setup. it'll be a fun evening.
capjack2000,...and  that is  the rub. all online casinos offer the same games and odds. meanwhile for the consumer variety of offerings is key for online sportsbooks. pa consumers are getting painted into a corner.

dinkinc,thanks to  for the endorsement of my touting for the  rescue horses. the people who run that charity do it for all the right reasons. tomorrow i will explain how the monthly donations work
dinkinc,thanks...  i do appreciate most of the people here but it has become too much a part of my day.. i may just limit my friends to messages and get rid of everyone else
dinkinc,we all should be talking politics.  this is important.  the man ignores climate change. that one thing is enough for me. separating families next. then constantly lying followed by history with women etc etc

robpizzola,i havent held babcock in high regard since he scratched p.k. subban and martin st. louis in favor of dan hamhuis and chris kunitz for team canada. i think his player usage is abysmal.
robpizzola,not saying fleury didn't let in a softy. but it should have never came to that. much higher likelihood of fleury letting in a softy than theodore getting undressed with the positioning he had.
robpizzola,edge threshold is completely dependent from person to person. i play all edges 1 percent  in hockey which will result in higher volume. i determine the bet sizes using 1/4 fraction of kelly criterion.
robpizzola,the two meetings that they had in march were dominated by vegas. knights win both games if they didn't have to roll with subban on the second of a b2b in the latter one.
robpizzola,im awake for f1 qualifying for the first time in years because of netflixs drive to survive documentary series. one of the best docs ive ever watched. completely revived my interested in formula 1.
RASPicks,archives can be accessed by subscribers at anytime. we just  daily fantasy sports  post them publicly anymore for various reasons. literally almost any prominent name in the industry can vouch for our record keeping.
VegasRefund,if youre looking to bet the total.. youre better off waiting on an in-game spot to jump on.. a scoring drought (very likely) or both teams all the sudden cant miss (which wont last).
VegasRefund,zion is about to take over the  college basketball  world.  daily fantasy sports  think we have seen a player in a long time garner as much attention as he potentially will get this year.
ProfessorShine,then what was the point of this convo?  it started because i pointed out alex b smith and sportsmemo are sales frauds and dont help  listeners.   all of a sudden my resume is requested
suuma810,"if your employer hasn't blocked  yet go read the hot-off-the-press green bay #packers team preview! 

despite all the struggles they went 10-10-1 with a +25 point differential in full games with rodgers since 2017."
ClevTA,exactly! the spread was correct as i tried to explain. never said browns were covering just that the line was correct. everyones minds were blown bc all they look at is win loss record
ClevTA,no idea where lillard's upside comes from. at this point he really can't produce any better numbers and the west is way too good to win anything like 60+ that is a big outlier
ClevTA,just looked for the first time in a while but the top 3 defenses in yards per play allowed are all big 10 tms? i think that says more about the big 10 unfortunately
ClevTA,this debate is the most apples to oranges i think ive ever heard. guess u have your opinion but u are watching a totally diff broadcast than everyone i follow or who follows me
ClevTA,u seem like a really smart guy. i saw week 1 and now i see these. i have to ask what possible inputs are creating these wild probabilities and why are u using them
CizzlingSports,dont have  tweet handy but in between those two abortions zuma told  that he didnt understand the concept of value and the second ss was # worst of all time 's reply to that

""what bankroll do i need?""

""gotta figure that out for yourself champ. you gonna send that $3000 now or what?"""
CizzlingSports,i'm sure the suckers paying  for picks are tickled pink he's thumping his chest abt pushing a pick at a number better than what he sold them which he gave out for free on
CizzlingSports,"hold on checking - ok the alleged historical records are still presented in standard tout document-dump format.

hold on checking - ok still no cogent response to the issue of selling correlated plays.

etc."
spanky,disagree. i've had many esports experts approach me wanting to become betting partners.  they think betting a football game is the same as betting a video game and collecting the winnings is so easy.

spanky,my felony was in ny state not nj. i cant bear arms i cant vote and i cant serve on a jury.  no one said i cant bet was part of the deal lol
spanky,a really sharp friend who i highly respect recommended i bet enough so if i lost it would sting a little. he told me opportunities like this probably come 2-3 times in a lifetime....
spanky,this book made me tens of thousands of dollars playing joker wild progressives in ac while in college trying to build by bankroll.  special place in my heart. not a bad investment for $14.95

PlusEVAnalytics,we are diligently updating our models and hoping that the picks youve already bought will start to show some value immediately followed by buy our new picks available now g. t. f. o. h.
PlusEVAnalytics,"taking the son to his first pokmon tournament tomorrow  googled the rules apparently any card made  1 year ago is illegal to use in tournament play. well played
pokmon industrial complex i salute you."
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah i know thats what everyone says but i think that explains why coaches are too conservative not why they dont adjust properly to win prob. perhaps large favs should kick more field goals.
PlusEVAnalytics,off topic but im surprised the lucky 15 stacked parlay doesnt seem to be a thing that exists in n america. its a nice intuitive concept good marketing opportunity for some enterprising us book.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh im not trying to show anything about the meaning. im trying to buy your closing line value from you so youll have no reason to complain anymore when you get +clv and lose...
PlusEVAnalytics,if your quant model is spitting out 13 nfl plays in one day they cant be all 54 percent  modeled wp right? what do you think the top play was? 65 percent ? 70?
PlusEVAnalytics,youre missing the point. if performance is good you will have historical results regardless of performance. if performance is bad you will have crickets and block anyone who dares to remind you of this.
PlusEVAnalytics,if im right (big if lol) and if the markets havent adjusted properly there will be a + roi for lets say moneyline dogs +300 or higher in weeks 1-4. whos got the data?
PlusEVAnalytics,the universe of unexpected surprises (domestic international economic geopolitical etc) that could happen between now and nov 2020 has gotta split like 80 percent  would help democrats / 20 percent  would help republicans right?
PlusEVAnalytics,gonna invent my own probability distribution. gonna call it the plusev distribution. for the sake of legitimacy ill say it was discovered by hungarian statistician gregor plusev. but gambling twitter will know whats up.
PlusEVAnalytics,cool article  and your article on momentum was interesting too. have you ever tried to fit a mixed model to predict the results for the remainder of a match conditional on the observed results?
PlusEVAnalytics,sure but thats not my point. lots of people will get mildly sick recover may not even realize they had covid19 instead of the flu and be excluded from the denominator of mortality ratios.
aluckyaday,did the new owners coincide with leaving the us market? i think it was one of matthew trenhaile's podcast that he talked about them changing how they operated when they left the us market.
aluckyaday,that is the funniest thing i've heard all night  but in reality winning has very little to do with it. its how you bet that gets you restricted not how much you actually win.
aluckyaday,i would say that  breaking electoral funding rules when buying fear based social media adverts without any risk of the poll being invalidated is a very dangerous precedent to set. win at all costs.
aluckyaday,but is that better that contentious refereeing decisions? actually it is an interesting point. the sample of contentious refereeing decisions will be larger and therefore more likely to even out over a shorter period
aluckyaday,better modelers get special treatment. they are the ones that have to be dealt with by improving their own models. marco tells a good story about the esports punter that they could not beat.
aluckyaday,do pinney provide them after event via an api or do you have to capture them in real time/scrape from a comparison site? i use oddsportal but not certain it is always that accurate.
aluckyaday,maybe passing the poisoned brexit challis to johnson will turn out well for stewart when johnson fails to deliver the impossible he will be there to pick up the pieces. i told you so.....
aluckyaday,hate to tell you guys that its only going to get worse. betfair sportsbook in the uk same company as fd will not take a penny yes not even $0.01 from me on anything.
aluckyaday,would be interesting to know what features you use to model it. how do you put a number on the quality of the song? staging? are they predictive or is past voting more relevant?

joeytunes2,growing up we always use to argue iverson vs kobe. i always said kobe was better bc he played amazing defense. rip life is short. do everything you want to do. never hold grudges.
joeyisaks,i completely agree and added more biden +400 to win dem nominee.. but most think biden performed poorly/ but its same people who think harris or sanders would have an actual chance vs trump
EdMillerPoker,"i think the vast majority that actually make good opinions quietly work basically hit on exactly one thing for a window of time.

post-window a lot then seem to transition to bad opinions loudly."
EdMillerPoker,every time i bin the guy i get a ton of pushback and told i havent consumed enough of his swill to see the genius. maybe theyre right. but his twitter is objectively terrible.
EdMillerPoker,well thank you. were trying to build out a specific piece of the picture. hoping if we are successful it will refocus the industry a little and people can build on top of it.
EdMillerPoker,the projections are derived both from pregame and in-game information. something you will see is that most data feeds currently in use do a very poor job of integrating in-game information into the projections.
EdMillerPoker,a simple way is to use data of similarly lined games and see how often they land between the two spreads and compare that to the break-even percentage on the spread and money line
EdMillerPoker,if you started with $100 and parlayed all the winners of all 32 of the first round games you would have won $742 after your limits were cut to 3 bucks by thursday afternoon
EdMillerPoker,edge times volume. edge is v high and so is volume. i have to hand it to the slot designers these days the games are great at getting you to keep pressing the button.
EdMillerPoker,i'm not sure anything has puzzled me as much in my adult professional life as seeing how much $ dk/fd raised on the promise that dk/fd-style  daily fantasy sports  was gonna be a thing

nonrandomalpha,listen i know beating the lions twice the giants and a crumbling cowboys team gave you a lot of misplaced confidence but next three games are nothing like the last 4. get a grip.
nonrandomalpha,actually it was very consistent; they got gashed on the ground repeatedly last week and did again this week. saints just slow bled the cowboys draining the clock whereas packers just repeatedly stabbed cowboys.
nonrandomalpha,we post our nfl recap and preview of next week spreads at 6 am on mondays. spice up your life. oh and were 1/2 point out of first place in the circa million contest.
nonrandomalpha,except the bears were dumb enough to offer nearly the same pick and dump eddy. we inadvertently accomplished the optimal decision thru force of circumstance. not impressed with bears staff at all this season.
nonrandomalpha,"nfl week 1 is in the books. how'd we do?

LeeSharpeNFL,the cares teams are 55-18 but i think  that is  less useful for the reason  cites: teams that potentially can make the playoffs or can improve seeding are generally much better than their opponents.
LeeSharpeNFL,disagree. the fact that teams still have something to play for something in the regular season (the byes) even after earning playoff spot is highly valuable i  daily fantasy sports  want to lose that.
LeeSharpeNFL,it looks like  it is  impossible for the saints to have a tiebreaker win over the other nfc playoff teams so saints to get a bye need someone else to lose down the stretch.
LeeSharpeNFL,he isn't being him. i think he knows trubisky is bad and is calling plays like it. weirdly i  daily fantasy sports  even think he's correct to do that i think it hurts trubisky.
LeeSharpeNFL,you can take cpoe and dakota and measure how far above or below a given qb is from the average qb that year (either raw or as a percentage). era adjustments aren't that hard.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""the first half of the 49ers schedule has faces easy offenses so we should adjust for that in our projections moving forward.""

""wow  daily fantasy sports  you know a data set can be biased?"""
whale_capper,cringeworthy because you think were using it incorrectly or because you dont think pointing out who is calling offense in a way that is optimal for winning games is an effective way to handicap?
whale_capper,ill refresh my memory on who hes taken in the first two rounds over the last ten years but the hit rate is something like 20 percent  compared to league avg of ~40-50 percent
whale_capper,all of that is spot on... envisioning if he goes to the clipps though they surround him with horford beverly and their already deep roster that puts them clearly in front come playoff time
whale_capper,derby pod! a little horse betting 101 followed by race handicap featuring horse racing aficionado  at 23:00. we break down all of the most interesting aspects of this year's run for the roses enjoy!

JoeyKnish22,"i like riley with a lot of time off to gameplan hopefully they get the ball first but gonna sprinkle:

oklahoma 1q +6.5 (-110)
oklahoma 1q moneyline +210

all small."
JoeyKnish22,im sure dk/sbt fanduel/betfair and will hill all make it for sure. beyond that it will be a wait and see. pretty friendly regulatory environment/taxes and large wagering population so hoping that brings operators.
JoeyKnish22,folks. effective immediately the knish invitational is over with. ive declared myself the champion and will be taking the winnings to vegas to ask kiv to marry me. thank you to everyone who participated.
JoeyKnish22,thats espns own preston johnson folks. you wanna tell your kids you went up against the guy with the well manicured beard and so-so nfl picks on tv. this is the pool for you.
JoeyKnish22,theres no case for chase young. zero. ohio stare would still be undefeated without him. he missed 2 games via suspension and was a ghost against michigan. dobbins and fields deserve votes over young.
JoeyKnish22,"don best notification that buckshot calvert is out for liberty with 1 minutes until post. 

i go into a panic. (on liberty large)

turn on game to see how backup looks. 

calvert is playing...."
JoeyKnish22,im not sure whatever happened to customer service in this industry but lets just say im gonna need a buffet pass and stack of drink tickets to make up for being treated like this!
JoeyKnish22,i think its over. steph and dray have too many miles. dont see any plausible move that gets them back to the apex. can only ride a certain core so long theyre tapped out.
JoeyKnish22,not necessarily true not gonna say it was super liquid. but bm was taking 1k with rebets. it was posted everywhere including offscreens. could have easily got 5-10k without too much of an issue.
JoeyKnish22,if you wanna lay the juice no endorsement -1000 and no curse word -300 are probably good. wayyy too early for endorsing somebody else and highly unlikely curse word is said on network tv.
JoeyKnish22,wnba contest finish was as close as it gets! all winnings have been distributed to kevin backers by knishypph. thanks to all who participated. be on the look out for another contest coming soon.
JoeyKnish22,could do without the final table cheering sections. pretty obnoxious after every hand and im not trying to hear from a bunch of people that wanna sauce me up now cause im a millionaire.

LockyLockerson,"i want to thank those hundreds of dummies for booing andrew luck so now every ""thought leader"" who writes a column for a site gets to yell at me about how awful humanity is."
LockyLockerson,quick timeout to say 3 isnt nearly as valuable in the preseason so you should probably sell it if you can.  1 is a value that comes up much more than 3 because...preseason.  woo.
LockyLockerson,incase you missed it : have gotten a lot of great feedback on the podcast from last night a great 90 minutes to get you ready for college football in less than a month!
LockyLockerson,"99.9 percent  of my tweets are about sports or gambling but man...it is really awesome being a dad.   it is  the best.  happy father's day to everyone.

chadmillman,been asked often: when will  app allow users to see lines on player props and track them? well the amazing product team has added that feature in time for super bowl. go download now.
chadmillman,sure  has a big browns scoop if you're into that. but does he have charles barkley an $800k bet on the pats in 2002 and the trend it started?  that is  capital j journo-stuff.

Gingfacekillah,"3/n in discussing some ideas with  i discovered this assessment could be considered roughly analogous to ""pascal's wager"". it seems reasonable prudent and pragmatic to make some preparations if you haven't done so already."
Gingfacekillah,thanks! glad that you found it helpful. you might also like my podcasts with  and  where i get into details on a simple mlb prop model or my simple poisson simulation nhl model article:
Gingfacekillah,anyways i think i've beat this to death but hopefully you've found the analysis helpful. using a little common sense and paying attention it is possible to anticipate market overreactions to recent player performance.
Gingfacekillah,a second look at okc's b2b indicators shows that their og should drop around 3.3 when playing the second game of a b2b. combined with another tweak or two the forecast starts looking better.
Gingfacekillah,and as per your contrarian method these biases seem to appear at the team level as a random walk. looking at it from too high a level can obfuscate the value of these inefficiencies.
logan_matthews9,if picks arent even how can i get at least one contrarian pick that also fits the above rule? for example majority on clem/under and under favors clemson - take either lsu/under or clem/over
logan_matthews9,i actually think your average fan just doesnt notice the tactical wrinkles. i get a little agitated when i see berhalter hasnt made any changes since he started! despite making several wholesale tactical adjustments
logan_matthews9,can someone much better at college football gambling than me explain the wvu -6 line? i know jmu is good but feels like six points too low for a top 50ish team at home.
logan_matthews9,thats a very very small percentage of costs. das have strict standards of field/field space number and level of coaches not to mention theres a formal application process that you have to go through
logan_matthews9,thank you! he was on the u20s a cycle early. people pretending that us are ignoring this kid are crazy... hes just using his dual citizenship as leverage to get a call up early
logan_matthews9,and at what point is your sample size good enough to make adjustments? because your average bettor who assumes theyve got a 55 percent  edge will be broke well before he gets to 1000
logan_matthews9,gotta take the good with the bad when it comes to playing injuries. i still think orlando -4.5 is a good line with sactown on a b2b and no iman. still loving okc tonight!
PikachuBets,i've always said i'll watch any sport on tv. not necc enjoy it but it gets a chance. today i realized that i have to draw the line at little league girls' softball. lol
PikachuBets,spoken like someone who doesnt use multiple outs. you definitely need to track the outs themselves and keep eyes on them to make sure the balance doesnt get out of hand (if you win)
adamchernoff,nfl injuries have a major impact on point spreads and totals but often times they result in over inflation. here is why properly valuing the backup can be more important than valuing the starter.
adamchernoff,spoke pretty adamantly about perus ability to exploit bolivia in the middle of the pitch on the #copaamerica round two video for  this ridiculous play summed up that advantage quite well. dominant 90 minutes.
adamchernoff,thanks for taking the time to read and listen. patrick mahomes is not injured and i do not believe that anything that occurs in the post season will affect the regular season mvp award.
adamchernoff,"thanks simon. 

gill is way cooler than i though. i got inspired and tried to pull off the clear glasses look too it lasted about 20 minutes before my wife made me return them."
Ccon8181,"back to work strong lean to the under but sticking with the winners here.

#warriors -3 -115 first half 

and 

#warriors -5 -110 full game each risking 5.5 percent 

 selective sides"
Ccon8181,reading 2nd half lines #xavier +2 is a solid play.. i wont be on it though i prefer to bet against the best and hottest team in the nba with the slumping #clippers +7
Ccon8181,agree lots of teams go soft at the end but with 7 minutes left to run up the gut 3 times when you've had no success and punt?? what the fuck  not up 24
ToddFuhrman,it is  go time...monday night football edition of  with  gets you ready for colts at saints reviews the biggest results from week 15 and shares up to the minute injury intel from the incomparable
ToddFuhrman,"the committee loves storylines

you know theyd love to make lsu the #1 if it meant hurts against the tigers

keep ohio st #1 if it means fields against georgia 

captain conspiracy around here"
ToddFuhrman,the guys at circa have been great getting up numbers first.  i'm sure they saw a few dog bets but when the market opened prices have a tendency to normalize regardless of the shop
ToddFuhrman,"let us  not bury the lead here that this is all to protect his business and not truly a ""bet"" with risk... it is  win win all the way around for his furniture promotion"
ToddFuhrman,college sports were fun while they lasted. of all the things this country has on its plate making sure student athletes get paid for their likeness definitely should be #1 priority in every state
ToddFuhrman,"odds on starting qb battles (via  )

ToddFuhrman,do you still choose to bet them despite this  feeling and what do you mean when you say to a certain extent? always curious to get an idea of how people see the space...
TheCousinSal,still waiting on the punishment. unless the league allows those who bet the steelers +3 or mason rudolph fantasy owners decide this myles garrett character is going to be in a lot of trouble.
TheCousinSal,this week on against all odds the degenerate trifecta  i break down nfl week 10 lsu/bama ncaa hoops title odds best bets + is  the most arrogant sports personality on twitter? hint...yes he is.
TheCousinSal,i'm with  gronk to score + pats win (-150) is a prop lock. and if for some strange reason it doesn't hit triple up on it next week and 2 weeks after that. #gambling
TheCousinSal,whats higher - points scored in all bowl games combined or the number of times youll hear the mariah carey christmas song? the degenerate trifecta + i tackle this and so much more. #gambling
12Xpert,this is exactly what happens in the favourite-longshot bias. bookmakers can lengthen favourites knowing that punters will still back the longshots but ensuring that the favourites are still not quite offering value (on average).
12Xpert,data was 2014/15 to 2019/20 english prem champ leagues 1  2. matches with red cards removed. an expected slight bias against away teams but they foul more since on average they have less possession.
12Xpert,real live tipsters are almost always full of shit usually they  daily fantasy sports  know it. i  daily fantasy sports  need to make kelly simulations. flat stakes is just fine for this purpose thanks.
12Xpert,i would agree with all of that. the puzzle for me now is why pinny  daily fantasy sports  operate a fully efficient tennis market. is it intentional or simply lack of data and knowledge?
12Xpert,however they see chance as the arbiter of outcomes as immoral too preferring instead to invoke diving providence e.g. the drawing of lots. i suppose you could respond by saying god helped me win.
12Xpert,your words not mine.  daily fantasy sports  presume to be in my head. people do that a lot i've noticed in life. maybe  it is  me  that is  the problem. i'll live with that.
JambosPicks,"8/20 recap: jambos' 11 recommended plays went 6-5 and were +0.44 units bringing our cumulative record for the #mlb season to +48.82 units. #gamblingtwitter

mschwimer,"1.  when you produce the type of returns i have been able to produce you can charge outrageous fees. 
2.  again we raised money in nov for the gp at an extremely high valuation."
mschwimer,it should be identical. or extremely close. bottom line is we judge on our system. so if you get better lines and win and we lose you still get the guarantee. and vice versa.
mschwimer,im stone cold serious when i say this. in 3 years you will look at this tweet and say holy shit. i said this to make fun of him. but it actually came true
mschwimer,this i 100 percent  agree with. as i have always said. the gambling would unanimously disagrees with me. but i have seen numbers that suggest otherwise. maybe people arnt looking in the right places...
mschwimer,we answered all the will you get paid questions. look into what it means to file reg d with the sec. all my partners and i will be breaking the law by not paying.
mschwimer,but why would we want to go through that.  would mean we would be tied up dealing with frivolous things left and right. i think it makes sense. 10k is a solid limit imo.
mschwimer,here is the most important thing. that you still refuse to answer. if you think we will lose why would you put your money where your mouth is. we are giving you 2.3-1 odds!!!
mschwimer,i cant see the each play that is time stamped. can you show me where to find that?  also do they give money back plus if their picks lose? i cant find that either.
mschwimer,i should also add that our record before 8/20 was against the best available line in a us book.  our record against the market consensus line at the time of release is +171.6 units
RufusPeabody,you have to go to a branch to do that. i've done it as well but i live in massachusetts where there aren't any branches and fly to barcelona tonight returning sept 30th.
RufusPeabody,the evidence is pretty overwhelming that betting using a tout will make a bettor lose more since you not only lose the vig but you have to pay a fee for the pick.
RufusPeabody,incase you missed it   and i had westgate  executive director  on the  podcast this week for our second straight week discussing bookmaking things. john gives a peak behind the curtain at the wg!
SportsCheetah,the argument was if utah won tonight then ou would need to run it up to get style points and the line would move up. ou just needs to win by 1 now.
capjack2000,"this is also the first  college football  wager ive ever made at draftkings. that tells you two things: 
1) i dont bet much  college football 
2) dk risk management assumes far too much."
capjack2000,"two things. first we should feel honored to have people like   and   (and others) corresponding with us daily on this platform. 

secondly i *need* that stardust sportsbook prototype painting hanging in my house."
capjack2000,"someone needs to do a periscope during this hour between games each nfl sunday and just make it a recap of today's #gamblingtwitter. 

part . 
part . 
all .

there's nothing like it."
capjack2000,again the most telling stat about the betmgm mobile betting product is that mgm does more revenue at their one brick  mortar location in nj than on their app...and apps rule the state.
capjack2000,"check out:
       the list could go on. 

prime example  does a spot on satellite radio that airs in the middle of the night for most of the country and brings a hype man:"
capjack2000,"by letter of the law...not allowed. however give me a 1 percent  equity stake in your entry and no other compensation and suddenly we're a permissible partnership. 

(this is not a binding offer)"
capjack2000,lines by lvdc (ie: south point). it'll be an interesting dynamic. chinook winds is known to sweat small money and the boys from lvdc do not. we'll see how this culture plays out.
capjack2000,"welcome to the show iowa! 

a shotgun launch to sportsbetting would be very exciting if you didnt have to physically go to every casino in a large state to sign up in person."
capjack2000,yes this will be their first foray into the us market. i'm interested to see how they approach it. iowa has the lowest barrier to entry ($45k) of any us market so far.
capjack2000,thats interesting  you mind posting a screenshot to confirm that? i know people who are limited at fd on prop bets but first ive heard of it on a straight bet like that.
capjack2000,the flip side is that mgm books have traditionally moved almost solely on action not news. so in theory one could move the number at an mgm book and affect the global line.
dinkinc,yesterday i learned that felons are not welcome on dating sights... probably saved me a lot of aggrevation but this might be the first time i felt sad about my bookmaking felony ...
dinkinc,i bet the winner but there was a moment in round three where i would have gladly cancelled my bet...so in a way it was close.. it was a gutsy performance for sure
robpizzola,when  and the pizza man put their heads together on a stone cold nfl lock you best believe that we are going to cash (a game that we definitely didnt deserve to win).
robpizzola,just as an fyi i was not accusing that account of being you. just pointing out that it was someone hiding behind a fake account for the purposes of interjecting in this convo.
robpizzola,first handful of races were fairly dull by f1 standards. some tracks that are tougher to pass and not a whole lot of action. but the past few races have been ridiculously good.
robpizzola,was his reveal that jon is aegon meant to stir up shit with dany? if that was brans master plan all along then its brilliant. but we were never given any additional insight.
robpizzola,.274 xwoba this season. his era may be up and i'm slightly concerned by the amount of hard hit balls but he's striking out one third of opposing batters and not walking guys.
RASPicks,the release model absolutely works  it is  just a matter of who and how many can be given access to it.  a small hand picked group has and will continue to work well.
VegasRefund,if the vikings were to play in the super bowl how that would effect the market from a revenue generating standpoint for the city is one of the most interesting potential storylines imo.
ProfessorShine,mediocre power 5 teams are better than most mid-major teams is generalizing.  give me murray nevada utah state st mary irvine wofford n. kentucky yale vs mediocre mid-majors in their own separate tournament
suuma810,"become a more successful #nfl bettor:

1. sign up at .

2. get picks write-ups  use the weekly cheat sheets to your advantage.

3. realize you are becoming smarter  well-informed.

suuma810,"the jacksonville #jaguars projected starting safeties have played a combined 669 career snaps. 

their defense is projected to face the second-hardest schedule this year using 2018 expected points added per offensive play numbers."
suuma810,vernon had some injury issues the last two years but he also had the 7th-highest pass rushing grade among edge rushers in 2018. should be a solid upgrade opposite of myles garrett. #browns
suuma810,"some books opened #titans +3 against the #colts on  sunday night football . marcus mariota is not ruled out says he will ""do everything in my power to see if i can go""."
suuma810,"dan quinn just said the three areas the falcons need to improve are turnover margin run offense and run defense. he wants his rush offense ""to provide the balance to make play-action go""."
ClevTA,what i meant by not awful team it also matters that the opposing offense doesnt constantly go 3 and out too: jax indy and det have bad os and barely had the ball
ClevTA,bengals were my day 1 sleeper team. the aj + ol injuries/retirement cluster certainly hurt their upside chances but lots of positive luck and regression is expected all expected from me at least
CizzlingSports,".lmao pete last week  picked iu over osu because he ""didn't trust fields day et al. on the road."" he also didn't know about the iu qb sitch. wouldn't waste any time here."
CizzlingSports,"uh  you have know better than to blindly accept  self-scored incomplete and fake records.

his real 2018-19  college football  records are below.

he's trying to fool you into paying for his losing picks."
spanky,sounds interesting. how much time is required to spend every week?  im way too boring to do it myself. i need to pair up with someone that actually knows something about sports lol.
spanky,great point. had he gotten hot early  market would have reacted and i could have gotten value that way. the future wager was just a form of insurance. i still hope he wins.
spanky,thanks to     for taking time out of their day to offer their insight. thanks to paris smith vic salerno johnny aitken and joe lupo for providing insight from their side of the counter.
spanky,everyone including myself hates the guy cuz he swindles people out of their money.  thats admiration? like i said his great marketing skills are undeniable but they are used for evil which sucks.
spanky,ive never stiffed anyone in my life ... i have million dollar credit lines all around the world... i probably bet more this morning then youll ever see in your life. just sayin
spanky,hey  .  given my app banishment and reduced counter limits are you going to offer me a complimentary entry into your tournament? what good is a national championship without the champ being there?!?!?
DocBettor,i think that lebron to javale alley-oop to start the #lalvsbos game just missed tying this cp3 to blake one for the fastest basket to ever start an #nba game cc #nbatwitter #lakeshow
DocBettor,"this bet is a win but feels like a loss because i clicked ""max bet"" on buffbet to see what the limit was and they were willing to take 11k. so much fomo."
DocBettor,happy to cash this one after the bad beats of brow scoring 0 in the 4th quarter opening night and danny green getting 2 fouls in the first 3 minutes the other day
PlusEVAnalytics,im a terrible handicapper and also a homer but still buf +4000 to win afc seems generous? same odds as ind and cle who are far from locks to even make the playoffs?
PlusEVAnalytics,is there though? they could be priced to 102 percent  on average but adverse selection eats into that very quickly youll take action only when youre on the wrong side of the market.
PlusEVAnalytics,the concept of parameter variance  described in my last article provides an alternative explanation for the data observed here. what if its not a hot hand but the manifestation of a good day?
PlusEVAnalytics,if you want to win by increasing turnout you have to nominate bernie and if you want to win by flipping trump voters you have to hold your nose and nominate bloomberg right?
PlusEVAnalytics,a sad reality of the business world is that its so complex that its easy to confuse the facade of intelligence with real intelligence. this is why people use leverage as a verb.
PlusEVAnalytics,highly probable the response is overblown doesnt necessarily mean the response is inappropriate. suppose 95 percent  chance its minor 5 percent  chance its the worst pandemic in 100 years. see taleb precautionary principle
aluckyaday,in the future? one area where the us is way behind the rest of the world is gambling. watching what is happen in the us is like going back in time in europe
aluckyaday,100 percent  certainty this discussion pops up every 10 years. if you really want to get facetious you need to account for the different year length between the gregorian and julian calendar too
aluckyaday,pinny will charge the maximum they can get away with to get the information they need. if they guys they see as sharp are willing to pay what the rest do is irrelevant
aluckyaday,sad day. i will never forget my 200/1 for his incredible mandela day win in the tour flying past an amazed pinot and bardet. until this year my biggest ever priced cycling winner.
aluckyaday,that said what we call spread betting firms like pointsbet do seem to be more sharp friendly than the fixed odds ones.  knows a lot more about those kind of firms than me!
aluckyaday,is calculating maximum draw down from a series of results as difficult as it seems to be. it feels like it should be easy. am i missing something? maybe my brain is asleep.
aluckyaday,think about it  that is how all limits work! its the fact that the limit for profiled sharps are low that is your issue not that you can not bet $1 over it!
aluckyaday,is the standard affiliate model in the us a flat fee per referral? in europe it tends to be a continuing relationship where the referer is paid a percentage of the client losses.
aluckyaday,it has certainly made it easier to bet and increased the size of the market dramatically. large markets attract large corporates. sharps are an expense. in the corporate world minimizing expenses maximizes profits
aluckyaday,massive growth does not create liquid markets. i'd dispute your use of the word massive. global gambling growth is not predicted to be massive? us growth maybe but on a global scale no.
aluckyaday,the players coming in to the us are european marketing companies. they have no intention of increasing the worldwide liquidity that spanky is taking about. they are intent on doing exactly the opposite.
aluckyaday,i'm just not convinced that inconveniencing a subset of players for something that will only help a different subset is a good solution. inconvenience and benefits should be consistent across all staking levels.
aluckyaday,in the uk its now normal to gamble. you can't watch sport without being bombarded with adverts encouraging you to gamble. its easier than sending a text message. then the real problems start.....
aluckyaday,any control wrestled back from the eu via #brexit and there probably won't be much if we still want to trade with them will be handed on a begging bowl to the us.
aluckyaday,in reality i believe it is more democratic because of the pr system of electing representatives. in the uk a vast proportion of voters opinions are disregarded just because of where they live.
aluckyaday,but they  daily fantasy sports  really care if they are wrong. if you take the value side you get restricted if you take the other they laugh all the way to the bank!
joeytunes2,my guy gets it! very good explanation. he knows first hand bc he saw it. this is the type of stuff that goes on. that alot of these mickey mouse websites dont understand.
joeytunes2,were losing market fast. now with  closing nj. from what i hear theres other states too. also hearing rumors of betgrande closing as well. (always a rumor). donbest is quickly becoming less valuable.
joeytunes2,it is  nice to not shun everyone. a fair shake. hes lines will be air tight. he knows you can use as an advantage. and the guy is a innovator. more to come.
joeyisaks,just picked up your book yday after seein you on the the global econ show and love it so far grew up 2 blocks from the hollywood bowl and it is the best!
joeyisaks,darren- you are using as your example a bookie who doesnt take more than 300$ a game and doesnt use a pph site... this is literally worthless as its so outside the normal
EdMillerPoker,not huge obv. your phone or whatever downloads it the moment  it is  released. helps us bc we get day 1 sales credit for all the preorders which boosts visibility via amazon's algorithms.
EdMillerPoker,its simpleminded populist nonsense. its literally impossible to solve global poverty through wealth redistribution. attempting to do so would create enormous amounts of corruption and violence that would make the world considerably poorer.
EdMillerPoker,"just laugh every time i see ppl tout stuff like ""bet on whether the next pitch will be a ball or strike"" as the *next big thing*. lolno for like 6 different reasons."

LeeSharpeNFL,it is  becoming more popular. when i interview job applicants i never even read the education section of their resume unless i'm checking to see if it explains a long work history gap.
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  from nflscrapr which bases its model off what has happened in previous games based on similar score differential time (and timeouts) remaining possession down and distance and position on the field.
LeeSharpeNFL,"nfl commentators: ""you gotta let them play.""

also nfl commentators: ""not calling pass interference in the rams/saints nfccg was so egregious that we had to cobble together a terrible pass interference challenge system."""
LeeSharpeNFL,"""but the more overall games the more exciting games there will be""

this doesn't follow. the more games you add the reduced importance there is on any individual game making games *less* exciting."
LeeSharpeNFL,"having trouble following 9 games at once? keep this scoreboard on the side of your monitor or check it on your phone!

clean display no ads or other bullshit. refreshes every 60 seconds."
LeeSharpeNFL,i posted a tweet earlier today and while there have been some thoughtful replies that caused me to reevaluate some placements overall making a post like thst attracts wayyyyy too many trolls. yikes.
LeeSharpeNFL,truthfully i've never used loess outside of plotting so i'm not sure. an interesting thought. ultimately my approach would be trying to get to a bayesian or elo solution like another reply suggested.

whale_capper,whats funny is the ed reed clip that was circulated this week made me think of you can draw the target and then disrupt the play thats the most valuable contribution of all
whale_capper,yeah ive gone against him a fair amount at home with inflated numbers and gotten waxed so i get that... your angles are making me think staying off it is the best play
whale_capper,would you say the fact that b2b roadies have no signal against the spread vs closing numbers just means the market accounts for it correctly... wouldnt be surprising since its widely talked about
whale_capper,no the offshores have offered free agency props sporadically but not ever at caesars or in vegas... theyve just been confusing the hell out of everyone posting hypothetical odds whatever tf that means
whale_capper,bodexpress who was on the also-eligible list now is in the field. every horse from no. 13 to no. 20 moves over one post position. bodexpress will be in the no. 20 spot
whale_capper,the market for rg is pretty stagnant until post-rome every year then people evaluate clay performance as a whole and hit the board... every player with a h2h win vs rafa gets pounded
AndyMSFW,not sure how many teams have come out and said that they've done this on purpose but it would never surprise me if the hoodie knows something well before i figure it out.
AndyMSFW,"couple small r2 matchups for the

snedekertway -115

3 balls went 1-2 today with the +175 winner almost breaking me even. so i'm already in much better shape than last week."
AndyMSFW,my numbers say it looks like a damn fine line. njit is better but quinny is a top-50 3point shooting team that could screw that up in a hurry if they get hot.
JoeyKnish22,"i usually only bet political props that dont have a long hold like sotu props or congress/governor elections etc.

JoeyKnish22,i was as well. very disappointing. and its coming at some point in canada probably sooner than later. unlike michigan they appear to realize how much revenue they are at risk of losing.
JoeyKnish22,i dont say things like that lightly. really changed the way ill even look at rsws going forward and how i would go about approaching them. applicable across all sports not just nfl.
TheKostos,i  daily fantasy sports  even know why i still watch.  it is  been bad for a long time and is showing zero signs of getting better. wwe is a total waste of time
TheKostos,as much as i want it to happen there's just no way they're smart enough to pull it off. bb would have to do it for them. i'm not getting my hopes up
LockyLockerson,afternoon nba updates now posted over at the patreon page.  numbers have moved a bunch and as a result the spreadsheet thinks there may be value in a couple spots.  we shall see.
LockyLockerson,at what price is he not worth a try? ive heard he was 120/1 then 100/1.  now 75.  seems unlikely we are still at the point where he is valuable in any way.
LockyLockerson,nets news is really fun but by the time durant suits up for real deandre will be even more washed than he already is which is really washed.  not exactly a big 3.

DannyParkins,he should enjoy the praise now because once the playoffs are over other 2017 draft picks named mahomes watson and kittle are gonna sign massive extensions that will look less impressive by comparison.
DannyParkins,i mean its looking terrible... you think i wont own it if it loses? do you know how often im wrong and everyone in my business is wrong? what are you talking about?
DannyParkins,that wouldve been an insane catch in college by anthony miller. i have no problem going for it their on 4th  7. only other option was taking a 5 yard penalty and punting.
DannyParkins,if you care at all about the officiating crisis that is happening in the nfl you need to listen to the  convo we just had when the podcast posts. that was incredible stuff.

Gingfacekillah,my guess would be that game theory factors into the 4th q as teams try to close score gaps. pace slows considerably despite being offset by increased fouling in the last 2 minutes.
Gingfacekillah,agree q the obviously better choice. hitch was more likely the best available that would a) come to edm given their dumpster fire and b) be willing to take a 1/2 year deal.
logan_matthews9,our entire backline structure has changed. cbs split way wider and the holding mid drops in. early on it worked more like a back 3 along with the rb tucking in we mentioned
logan_matthews9,im not sure if i have many poker people in my tl but any must-read/listens to elevate a relatively small stakes slightly + player looking to use it as a more noticeable income?
logan_matthews9,based on what? one player? the number of mexican/americans playing for the us and usynts vastly - and i mean vastly - outnumbers the ones playing for mexico. your point is completely baseless
logan_matthews9,a trade exception cant be used to sign someone. maybe they could use it to then st for kemba but salaries would have to match so theyd still have to send someone out
logan_matthews9,for example i initially took gs under 240 for two units. it moved to 243 added a half unit. three for three with that technique the past two nights worth monitoring going forward

PikachuBets,yeah if ppl want to think i went and conjured up a group chat ss in 5 minutes to prove a point then they have bigger problems than being annoyed with me lol
PikachuBets,"thinking you're gonna be the guy who can time the market profitably long-term using hindsight is the ""investing"" version of thinking you can beat 20c mlb long-term profitably using your star-spangled 3-year backtests"
PikachuBets,what? i just pick the winners. every day i wake up and my office 365 premium subscription spits out the winners then i bet them. picking winners is what  it is  all about!!
PikachuBets,rufus pls.  let us  not misrepresent the situation again.  made it very clear to me that the best of luck opener actually had a $500 limit. think about the difference that makes! $$$
PikachuBets,-307 is a best of luck opener. nobody else is up yet. best of luck limit is $250 to win. where are you betting 22.74 units on this  line u fucking tout. #berrykellystakes

no play on the spread. will live tweet anything cool at the game again. harvard yale here we come"
adamchernoff,hey thank you. i appreciate that. i have been working on getting better with presentation and explanation for the entire season so i am glad to hear that. enjoy the games this week.
adamchernoff,the team of    and  do great work at  the perfect mix of funny obnoxious entertainment great guests actionable info and quality takes from all. a ton of fun to listen to every night.
adamchernoff,"after the start i thought things were cruising to the undefeated week until the game died out. sf -3.5 comes through but over 46.5 does not. week finishes 7-1 (+5.81x). 

work attached below."
adamchernoff,"impact of #andrewluck on betting markets is now live on the podcast.

breaking down the new colts price point and looking at comparables within the market to sort out the chaos.

adamchernoff,thanks  however i will say that the fees on a lot of the atm's have got extremely high (i wrote this a couple years ago). worth noting the exchange rate during the process.
adamchernoff,reminds me of the saints game where they used 5 different rushers in the first half to try make it work then realized they were out of time to pass and catch up.
adamchernoff,"off a double bet win last week my weekly column for  breaks down my one wager this week. 

lets keep the great nfl season going and get another win this week. 

read here:"
Ccon8181,wow!! #pennstate no balls no faith. set up for  field goal  before the half down 14 with #minnesota getting ball 2nd half? yikes coach franklin not ready for nfl like rumors suggest. #psuvsminn
Ccon8181,im sure the patriots will find lots of vulnerabilities. i touchdown  be a far more interesting piece imo if you found where dolphins can find vulnerabilities in the patriots. regardless thanks for publishing.
Ccon8181,gave out #gsw ... at best value with 2nd half play = +4.5  field goal ... and #braves rl both cash. both were given out as free plays. 2-0 on to the next
kellyinvegas,whatever you need to help yourself feel better buddy  show came out at 8:30am on thanksgiving. guess i shouldve yelled at the producers for not updating the current line on a holiday morning.
ToddFuhrman,"jam packed  monday night football  edition with  featuring...

- complete #nyjvsne preview
- good bad  ugly from week 7
- lookahead lines
- next level injury analysis from  on mahomes tua and others"
ToddFuhrman,tried to share this sentiment before the year that the browns would get everyones best but people kept saying teams bring it every week...clearly showing every d (except the ravens) taking it personally
ToddFuhrman,just knowing the implications of pricing when it comes to how implied probability changes based on a line move or what kind of win rate required if youre laying -105 to -125 etc
ToddFuhrman,it is  a catch 22; do they deserve to be the favorite? sure but no chance i'd bet them and really believe there will be exceptional fade potential the first 15-20 games ats
ToddFuhrman,funny you say that; i remember my dad doing the same kept a manilla folder and would hand score them using me to double check in case any of his arithmetic was off
ToddFuhrman,i'm not concerned about you gambling at 12 but the child labor laws ha...guessing it was for a parent or family member rather than you punching a time clock then.  good with btw!
ToddFuhrman,"try this on for size...

according to the  $8.5 billion will be wagered on the ncaa tournament and more than twice as many people will bet on march madness compared to the superbowl"
TheCousinSal,october 1st and its gamblepalooza!!! on an all-new against all odds - nfl week 5 best bets mlb playoff picks nhl futures + gb great   i marvel over my successful lambeau leap attempt.
TheCousinSal,just listened to antonio brown speak for the better part of a hard knocks hour.  i take it all back.  hes got a good head on his shoulders. everythings gonna be just fine.
TheCousinSal,im going to pull a rare move and complain about refs calling a biased game in favor of a team i bet on. warriors are very lucky to be down 5 at half.
TheCousinSal,watch  today to find out if  broke the guinness record of placing a bet at 74 casinos in a 24 hour period. also im being told that blackjack dealer is an actual person.
TheCousinSal,long day for the bolts if brady doesnt get touched in the pocket and edelman spends all game bowling over dudes twice his size after every catch. opening line: kc -3.5 over pats?
TheCousinSal,"dear notre dame

there are several one loss/undefeated teams on the outside looking in.  are you sure you want to lay down for usc?  

love ya lots

- the ncaa basketball playoff committee"
TheCousinSal,someone very close to  guy named  guaranteed me hed par hole #1 during the first round of the corales puntacana resort  club championship. so i did the unspeakable and wagered on him (-160)..
TheCousinSal,a brand new against all odds podcast is up. the degenerate trifecta and i offer our favorite sunday props/best bets +  drops in to discuss harry harry hippos 52 by 52 weight challenge.
TheCousinSal,mike mccarthy would be a fine choice but i wouldn't be against going coachless for 2020. the boys were 0-5 in games decided by 7 points or less.  how could it be worse?
12Xpert,bookmakers typically get nervous about posting early odds for teams like this. hence when i come to post the odds at my usual times there have been no available odds for their matches.
12Xpert,just get rid of it. its ruining the game and the pleasure players and fans get when goals are scored for a dubious and marginal decrease in uncertainty regarding a range of decisions.
12Xpert,what is the point of you repeatedly saying this? give me a reasonable explanation otherwise i'll conclude you are a bot not a human and will block the account.  it is  just annoying.
12Xpert,"some people see the earth is flat. fortunately we have science that is more rigorous than simply saying i can ""see"" it. still not sure what bias it is you want to prove?"
12Xpert,"unfortunately the words ""survivorship bias"" appear nowhere in this article. until you learn what this is and take it into account this is my advice:  daily fantasy sports  ever pay anyone for tips."
12Xpert,anything that involves risking money risking items bought with money.... hmm let me think. mortgages loans credit cards insurance shares. wouldn't it be great if we taught children about risking money in schools.
12Xpert,im not sure id call it forcing. the wording requires the reader to think about sample and the fact that they are part of it to avoid the possibility of committing the fallacy.
12Xpert,i would need to see hundreds of sharp bettors like you showing the same pattern and knowing that they bet directly via pinnacle and not via a broker before i would be convinced.
JambosPicks,as  pointed out week 4 is incomplete.  however you are free to count it if you want.  that is why we post everything on out website.  different people like looking at different things.
JambosPicks,the #giants plate eight runs in the 8th to take a 10-4 lead over the #athletics which is perfect for our over 8.5 play but not so ideal for our as moneyline pick...
mschwimer,then the lines could move right after we release which would again be a disadvantage to subscribers as they would have less time to get the picks in at the lines we release.
mschwimer,i should say the limit is our bankroll. we need to make sure we can pay it all back if we lose. but i highly doubt we will ever get to our limit.
mschwimer,sign up for free and you will see! our record includes all our recommendations that are time stamped with the book we used so you can see all lines and when we post.
mschwimer,great article by  this has been a huge issue for a long time. i have been preaching a combination of a few ideas jayson wrote about that i think solves all the issues!
RufusPeabody,no offense michael but from what i've heard there are only a few dozen subscribers. and most people  daily fantasy sports  spend their time complaining about a product. they just cancel it.
RufusPeabody,some insight into how we at  see the rest of the  college football  season playing out simulating remaining games plus conf champ games 20000 times and using our probabilistic committee selection model.
RufusPeabody,this week's  is up featuring a recap of  g2e encounters the distinction btwn bettors and media covering betting a discussion of  college football  (and georgia more specifically) and  college football /nfl picks.
RufusPeabody,"a few model-based nfl takes that go against popular perception:
-the broncos are an average football team.
-andy dalton is an average starting qb.
-derek carr is an above average starting qb."
RufusPeabody,i was also saying you can have a model that does have value and betting based on it shows a profit but that doesnt mean your prediction is better than the market.
RufusPeabody,i gave out maryland -7 on  line closed -5.5. is that stronger evidence that we have only 8 listeners or that we have a lot of listeners out there fading me? cc
RufusPeabody,taking reasonable limits from everyone. no one-way markets (if youre offering yes offer no price as well). and not grading/settling some peoples wagers much more quickly than others in contests you run
RufusPeabody,it was sooo close. every time i step up to the ball on a par 3 i think this could be the shot and this was as close as ive ever come.
RufusPeabody,. asks  if he could beat nfl player props. (question wasnt answered.) berry will emphasize content related to player props. player props are a very easy on-ramp from fantasy to sports betting.
RufusPeabody,i had to submit a request for withdrawal that would take 2 days. i was flying out in 3 hours. so now i have 13k sitting in betmgm for the foreseeable future
jeffma,i'll refrain from answering this directly on twitter but we will cover it in depth on the next  podcast. although i'm sure you can guess my answer based on our previous interactions.
jeffma,this is an ongoing message from us on  there are very few touts who can beat the market + vig and almost zero that can provide long term value for customers. #trustalan
SportsCheetah,oh for  college basketball ? yeah i had a bet in it. we dont currently have a spot were posting daily picks or anything just do those on the daily wager show.
SportsCheetah,haha well this was mostly my point did he just all of a sudden start calling himself mr. over/under? is there evidence of everybody else calling him that first? i need answers.
SportsCheetah,good thing the guy lifted his leg in the end zone so his team could lose on the long pat instead of going to overtime (or going for 2 and the win)!
SportsCheetah,starting a new band thanks to matts tweet if anybody is interested. weve got  on guitar and im manning the drums. were taking bass and vocal demos and videos in the meantime.
SportsCheetah,the steph injury is unfortunate for many reasons but the one nobody is talking about is the fact that klay thompson had gone from joe harris to league mvp in 3.5 games.
capjack2000,"the concurrence of a bill which allows campaign donations in michigan from casinos and gaming tribes had nothing to do with it i assume. 

if you're looking for a domino...look at that."
capjack2000,"considering you only have one book offering college at all in oregon id say theres no reason to be first. 

does chinook still have ore +8.5 this week? that line perplexed me."
capjack2000,just league of legends world championship finals and only limited wagers on that. dge is saying $1k max operators may choose lower. i suppose this is a test case to see viability.
capjack2000,"dm's are open. 

sportsbetting is not a panacea but it is a reliable tax revenue stream. nv sportsbooks last had a losing month in july 2013...and will probably never see one again."
capjack2000,"heres a thread enumerating the areas of improvement left for  to discover in their roar product so it doesnt go out like a lamb (feel free to give them a nudge  

thread:"
capjack2000,"pa sports betting revenue is out. 
$109m in handle
$9.89m in revenue before promos and bonuses
$3.77m in promos
$6.12m in ggr (5.6 percent  hold)
76.3 percent  of wagers came from online/mobile"
capjack2000,"thanks for being brave enough to admit that defeat. honestly i'm oddly proud of it. it'll be a story i tell for many years to come. ""there's wrong...and then there's dead wrong."""
capjack2000,hypothetical scenario: if william hill was the only sportsbook in your state (bm/mobile) - and you would not be booted for winning too much - would you be ok with playing there?
capjack2000,i cant say for certain but it seems fd is content with the approach they are currently taking with regards to the db screen. im sure they subscribe they just stay off-screen.
capjack2000,interesting considering legalized markets shouldn't really have a hurdle to overcome in payment processing. all my nj outs already offer a branded debit card however bank ach or paypal are even easier.
dinkinc,wonder what the bc track bias will be .. doubt it will be the usual highway ... i am going in without any convictions and then concentrate on head to head matchups
dinkinc,it is  an important part of the american political climate.. i understand why in some cases it gives us a reason to live but it also gives us a reason to hate
dinkinc,for sure.... i think i will do it with a secured account ....it might be a little harder to find new donors but i have an idea that may raise more money
robpizzola,i think  it is  a fair question. he was never an elite quarterback at any point in his career but he did have a long stretch of being average to above average.
robpizzola,really wasnt even intended to be a troll. didnt think it would get as many engagements as it did. but once falcons fans started losing it on me i rolled with it.
RASPicks,"my issue is your statements regarding touts leave no room for exceptions. there is a good sized group of ""above average"" joe's who would and do find significant value in such services."
RASPicks,"ras  college basketball : we are 32-11 (74.4 percent ) in dec this year and 196-112 (63.6 percent ) in dec since 2008.  still five weeks left in our ""sweet spot"" package."
VegasRefund,even though i havent checked my comments im well aware that the haters are at an all time high which is fine.. just a few more flys on the wall then normal.
VegasRefund,before posting futures.. lines can vary drastically across the market so shopping for the best line can be very advantageous (if you can). betonline seems to be one with some nice value.
suuma810,first of all i think they should have fired the coaching staff instead of the gm last year. i would love if they can get a modern offensive-minded guy. maybe lincoln riley?
suuma810,"2-2 on the first slate. beat on ravens over 44 made up for the browns win on thursday.

bengals +3 l
den/bal over 44 l
oak/mia over 44 w
saints +3.5 w"
ClevTA,u guys have to stop saying cinci has the worst run d in the nfl. they are way worse defending the pass than run. citing total yards in any category is elementary
ClevTA,they have to eventually trade kuzma in a centerpiece of a deal if u ask me. somehow get iggy and trade kuzma and salary filler for a pg (dinwiddie?) would be ideal
ClevTA,i think he was talking specifically about tendencies in the red zone. maybe thats a big reason why theyve struggled all year? they dont run pick plays or rubs ever. very genetic
ClevTA,lol no problem. yes im talking ats. theyve been destroying these awful teams so i think when they finally face good teams theyll be overvalued a bit. thats all i was saying
ClevTA,guess u look at it like if they score at the end of the game and decided to go for 2 and the win instead of the pat. essentially the same outcome
CizzlingSports,we simply pretend we never previously failed selling picks or bought off the nfl 5.5 because a magic spreadsheet that excluded any reference to the nfl 5 told us to do so
spanky,"this a disgruntled employee of goldennuggetac who insults me because i brought light on his outfit kicking out winning players.  

how this joker still works there is surprising to say the least..."
spanky,"my last few tweets are the basis of my entire success in sports betting.

team and player analysis means nothing. 

line analyis means everything. 

hope i didnt inadvertently train any future competition"
spanky,i hear ya ed but i think there may be something unquantifiable or at least difficult to quantify in the playoffs for most sports.  its certainly a different animal than regular season...
spanky,miami and vegas are towns to sometimes keep an eye out on fading visiting teams who are prone to get bit by the party bug...  some are obviously more susceptible than others
spanky,an auto-linemover is what drives both businesses.  the ship is on cruise control but theres a lines manager there to adjust accordingly.... im shocked that very few others have developed this technology.
spanky,this is what you  daily fantasy sports  comprehend... if a game is supposed to be 145 going over 142 and under 148 is all hot side... nothing is cold about either bet....
spanky,nothing is wrong with fractional kelly. my tweet is explicitly against full kelly.  but in this scenario  fractional kelly will likely lead to lower positive expected value than the risk free choice
spanky,i've tweeted video/photo evidence of the following: 1.) banned from  2.) banned from   3.) limited severely by   4.) limited severely by  my goals: awareness and hopeful change on how winners are treated
spanky,this news sucks. tony has kicked my beards and i out a dozen times but he has always paid.  i hope his captors do the right thing and release him without harm.
DocBettor,hey  for your $50k nfl survivor contest there are already 6400 entries at $10/entry. how about increasing the prize pool rather than taking $14k (22 percent ) rake and counting? #gamblingtwitter #mybookie
PlusEVAnalytics,because it has a highly leveraged influence on the market valuation of company shares. i dont have the data to back this up but i wouldnt be surprised if its way overrated.
PlusEVAnalytics,the commutative property of certain operations like addition is not a license to move events around in time. it just means you can use the wrong method and get the right result.
PlusEVAnalytics,if your goal is to have people look at betting as an alternative to other investments good luck to you. you have a long way to go. building trust is step 1.
PlusEVAnalytics,i think i have a decent super contest strategy at least for the early season. now all we have to do is run this 100000 times and ill make a small profit!
PlusEVAnalytics,statistically significant is a red herring too. is it such a foregone conclusion that a bookie wont even put a line on it? if yes its statistically significant. if no its not.
PlusEVAnalytics,thats wild. my hypothesis from this sample of 3 is that theyre varying it by how much public money they expect to take on each matchup. do their other matchups support this?
PlusEVAnalytics,epistemic uncertainty. we *think* that as of *today* your risk of dying from corona is minimal. same goes for your risk of drowning in a bathtub. how might these assessments change tomorrow?
PlusEVAnalytics,xfl totals would be good to parlay all 4 over and/or all 4 under. the market is very uncertain and market errors will propagate across all 4 games in a correlated way.
PlusEVAnalytics,nobody knows. flu is a relatively known thing thats fairly stable from year to year in terms of cases and deaths. this thing could be less or could be much much more.
aluckyaday,yep. recreational players fund the business. tailor your business to what they want. sharps are a cost/risk they do not need. corporate solution cut out the cost. same as any other industry!
aluckyaday,favorite longshot bias . i would have thought the best chance of it working will be for outliers at the front of the market which are more likely to be loss leaders.
aluckyaday,they are not bookmakers they are marketing companies. their clients are not pro gamblers. they are recreational clients. why do you think you know better then them how to run their business?
aluckyaday,what happens when the till can't capture the bet? should the bet be automatically rejected or is there another process to follow where the mistake would not be picked up until settlement?
aluckyaday,i thought that would be the case. it got so bad in the uk that the government threatened to legislate so they agreed to have a whistle to whistle ban during soccer.
aluckyaday,but you got to vote on the government  that approved it. you do not get to vote on the individual laws that come out of the civil service. what is the difference?
aluckyaday,you can never know it is true however many bets you have only have a level of confidence! that level of confidence depends on the price of the bet and your roi
aluckyaday,it can be. if you have information that the market does not or their is enough recreational money in the market for the books to deliberately move away from an efficient tine.

joeytunes2,anyone who tell you high volume is a better change to lose. laugh at. truth is more games at positive positive expected value is much better. pros have numerous positions and bets.
joeyisaks,for health reason i had to change diet  didnt increase excersize just cut out sugar and carbs (on weekdays only im no hero) and im 3 -4 weeks already lost 8 pounds!
joeyisaks,the future is better to be poor in america than middle class and make 100k ... people will be taking pay cuts or everyone will somehow make 99.9 k a year magically
joeyisaks,if im wrong and you have a winning model or have trouble getting down size on these plays (lol) id gladly eat my words and donate $ to charity of your choice
joeyisaks,chadwick... thats one of the dumbest things ive read from someone whose bio reads pro bettor. high volume at +ev isnt darts if theres an edge. i had almost 40-50 plays yday

EdMillerPoker,attacking others in the gambling space tends to be a very cheap tactic because mounting any sort of defense almost always forces you to divulge information they can use competitively against you
EdMillerPoker,its been brought to my attention that i may have failed to properly credit the role   played in the writing of my books. and also my 9th grade english teacher mr cobbs.
EdMillerPoker,"two dozen brands trying to answer the question ""if someone uses one sportsbook how can i make it mine?""

EdMillerPoker,"it is  a hard problem and we're still in the early stages of regulated sports betting which fully explains what you're seeing.

but yeah there's massive opportunity for bettors at the moment."
EdMillerPoker,i suspect the more key variable isn't hidden vs not hidden but game speed (do agree hidden vs not hidden likely matters). slots and video poker both much faster than table games.
EdMillerPoker,i watched a ton of the great war episodes. extra history i like. kings and generals. now my algorithm promotes so many history videos i mostly just click on whatever it suggests.
EdMillerPoker,yeah thought the same about all that unfortunately. in general i'd like to see nv remain the nexus of us sportsbetting and for me part of that means letting new operators in

nonrandomalpha,nice cash although we thought the spread was at least 3 points off and should have been closer to 3.5/4 especially on short week when neither team is expected to be sharp.

LeeSharpeNFL,of course. if he thinks only was is interested in him fair enough. but i would gauge additional interest. was would be my last choice of a job if i could pick.
LeeSharpeNFL,i mean  that is  true. but expected points added of delta between going for it on 4th and 1 vs. punting is high enough that i'm skeptical team-specific effects would outweigh it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"was reading a website on the supreme court that had an article titled ""fourth down and goal -- will the court punt again?""

come on not even mike mccarthy was that bad."
LeeSharpeNFL,"why does 538 have the bills as high as 78 percent  to beat the broncos?

my model is significantly different. this is expected to be a battle between qbs named allen right?"
LeeSharpeNFL,maybe i'm alone in this but does anyone else find the circling player position identifiers continuing to move while the actual player movement is being paused and unpaused to be extremely jarring?
whale_capper,hodges more of a downfield threat and can take advantage of the weak secondary better than rudolph... mason off a head would likely run an uber conservative offense and shorten the game
whale_capper,congratulations to friend of the podcast and now bona fide author  ... well have him on next week to dive into some interesting angles lets us know if you have specific questions
whale_capper,the only over i like in the t8 is the clippers entirely under the assumption kawhi lands there... nuggs is fine... someone out of lal hou gsw okc por likely to miss
whale_capper,so rather than stay in the bay and rehab the dubs flew kd to canada to be a spectator but we're supposed to believe he might come back sometime this series? ...
whale_capper,by far the biggest factor in their favor in my opinion is the experience... having been on this stage so many times the dubs will be very tough to beat four times
whale_capper,its extremely tough to parse trends into the predictive and the nonsense but nba game 7 unders are among my favorite angles when you have g6 home teams coming off huge performances
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  think the margin on paper is high enough to keep a company like dunder mifflin solvent.  the payroll for a three-person in-house accounting department alone must be staggering.

JoeyKnish22,if youre good with referring to it as the knish invitational (weve had some dissenters who havent totally bought in yet) might be able to make room for a last minute adder.
JoeyKnish22,maybe a thanksgiving/black friday special odds-booster to move it back to 1000/1? ill add you to my thread. didnt know if circa had anything planned but this seems like a great opportunity.
JoeyKnish22,"back to my regularly scheduled programming. 

if youre not putting the cowboys in as many teasers as possible right now what are you doing with your life? 

i laid the -6.5 too."
JoeyKnish22,im hearing charlie strong has interest may not be going that well at usf but think hed be really perfect for rutgers. not sure how a strong/sitkowski combo doesnt revive the program.
JoeyKnish22,you stupid fucks worried about tax dollars. the mls playoff loser i give out on here tonight would have generated $10 million for the state alone. instead it goes to costa rica.
JoeyKnish22,anybody thinking of parlaying the jets and browns again this week?? dont have any money left but ive got some furniture and tools id be willing to trade for a parlay ticket
JoeyKnish22,i should have added salary/contract into the question to make the argument a bit more compelling. not saying brissett is great i just dont think too much separates him and jimmy g.
JoeyKnish22,i was apprehensive but  talked me into a couple sprinkles on lamar to lead the league in rushing and rushing  touchdown s. still some shops trading around 100/1 to 150/1 on each.
JoeyKnish22,in all seriousness agreed. dunks tastes good but its too weak sauce. the bucks just hits right. especially now that im over 30 lol cant afford to choose taste vs crack energy.
TheKostos,the sam darnold story might be my favorite of 2019. young star qb in ny plays well and then drinks and hooks up. wow what a shock!! would never have believed it!
LockyLockerson,to me this is very similar to bucks-hornets last year when everyone bet milwaukee over before the season steamed them opening night and they won but did not cover vs the close.
LockyLockerson,you could make the argument that because of the condition of purdue/nebraska in those games maryland at home will be the toughest game of minnesota's season so far.  what a hilarious joke.

LockyLockerson,i play a lot of these.  nfl sides are basically impossible for me to win money at because i'm not that smart.  these are not that way.  i have beaten these regularly.
LockyLockerson,preseason thread will start around 4pm and may be lengthy so if you want to turn off notifications now no one would blame you.  figured a 30 minute warning is pretty good.
LockyLockerson,koepka should just increase the awesome gesture each hole after giving the little girl the ball.  next hole buy someone a puppy.  coming up 18 just yell you all get a car!
LockyLockerson,"lost in all of this is daryl morey probably has the best team in the west by far under contract but a couple weeks ago said theyre all available

whoops? just kidding?"
LockyLockerson,"can someone make the argument for why more baseball playoff games is bad? i'm guessing history/tradition/""the way  it is  always been"" is prominently involved?  i am not an expert on this topic."
LockyLockerson,spurs are 14-20 and currently hold the 8 seed in the west.  to say this conference didn't turn out how we all planned after the couple elite teams would be an understatement.
EliHershkovich,mike white's game plan made zero sense. more than half of florida's attempts were 3s for a team that doesn't shoot well. work the ball through blackshear johnson  nembhard off the dribble.
EliHershkovich,i've given davey martinez a lot of sh*t but going to scherzer was a big-boy move. gave him some confidence too. hudson with some onions to cap it off. futures still alive.
EliHershkovich,"zion morant and barrett are a lock to go 1-2-3 tomorrow night. is there any value the rest of the way?

DannyParkins,thats the pitch thatll always keep you coming back with darvish. just nasty 96 miles per hour with movement on the black where contreras doesnt have to move his glove an inch.
DannyParkins,check it out. i plan to be on the next few episodes before im out of the country for the finale and i have no clue what im gonna do about that.
DannyParkins,sure if you want the cubs to be at a competitive disadvantage. they havent been primarily on a free superstation for many years. this is where media has gone and is going.
DannyParkins,oh man... if this is the vehicle that leo jumps to tv with im all-in. if hes just on as an ep ill be bummed we didnt get him in the movie.
chadmillman,season-long bad beat: my  buddies who bought knicks season tix thinking value would go up when kd signed. money was due the day kd was hurt the first time. hello wayne ellington!

Gingfacekillah,market hasn't moved this much but i think  it is  high. khalil mack  co. will likely give cousins a tough time in a collapsed pocket. estimated range: 157 - 191 pass yards.
Gingfacekillah,"here's the link to the spreadsheet:



some assembly required. you'll have to experiment with finding an optimal k value and also decide on your output function. a place to start anyways. enjoy."

no sportsbook would consistently book these plays unless they knew you were a square

if you really were good at this you wouldnt need to sell picks for pennies"
logan_matthews9,"two things i hate doing:

but still i grabbed jags and denver +4 a couple books still have that up. and faded the seahawks steams eagles +115"
PikachuBets,guys who made it like you are the overwhelming exceptions to the rule. on the buy side the vast majority of your younger colleagues hold degrees from elite schools. yes or no?
PikachuBets,"nothing like watching a midnight sportscenter rerun to see a ""top 10"" play from a cfl game and thus learn that 27 points were scored in 4q to dick your u47... #gambooling"
PikachuBets,for what  it is  worth  it would actually a fascinating survey and i'd be interested in the results.  daily fantasy sports  care about shoes obv anymore but i'd be interested to see
PikachuBets,read my tweet. i am making fun of a tan gambooling ekspert for being so rich off of his experteeze that he can afford to bet a whopping $100 on nba finals
PikachuBets,imagine implying you are the bill belichick of betting  what the fuck fffffffff the only similarity between the two of you is that you've both been publicly accused/exposed/targeted with cheating claims loooool
PikachuBets,"bruh 10c is a gigantic difference. 2.38 percent  and 1.97 percent  in your examples. if  that is  a ""lean"" to you then you need to relearn how betting prices work like asap"
PikachuBets,my database isnt set up to do the totals and im too lazy to redo stuff only for a couple of games. it only moved 1-1.5 nothing exciting. -4 to -7 tho

Ccon8181,"weekly recap: worst week of the season last week. just means time to go on the big run.

last week: 3-9 

happy thanksgiving yall. got a profitable weekend on deck this week."
Ccon8181,"back at it for #mnf .. get this out for you guys early. on this two pack:

#niners -5.5 -110  -6 worst 

#niners #seahawks under 47.5 -110 47 worst

#seavssf #nflpicks #skininthegame"
Ccon8181,youre right they are at different levels but id take butler or klay thompson over harden and leave cp3 and take my chances then try to build around harden as the 1.
Ccon8181,true its easy to fake a screenshot of a random fake offshore account but i havent seen fake bet slips and if so they can be verified by book of need be.
Ccon8181,76 percent  of the poll respondents believe that less than 50 percent  of media/touts/professional bettors wager more than $100 on the sides they advise!!! which leads me too a follow up question...
Ccon8181,#msu always does me dirty... isso must have given the guys the last 4 days off. still sleep walking verse a osu team that will fold at the first sign off pressure.
Ccon8181,im still not over utah up 20-3 going in to score to start the 3rd.. fumbling have having it returned for a touchdown! then just folding up. kinda fitting end to 2018
Ccon8181,i miss the days where the players would rather limp/crawl/roll off the field  than have the trainer come out and tend to them. football needs that toughness back! # college football  #nfl
ToddFuhrman,"i understand nfl players hate preseason games for increased risk of injury...

ToddFuhrman,"sports gambling will test your patience self control perseverance math skills discipline reading comprehension emotions and resiliency

dont ever let it test your financial resources; always bet responsibly and within your means."
ToddFuhrman,i wont claim to be overly knowledgeable on the sport but can appreciate greatness and the fact these guys rarely let down or all go cold at the same time is incredible
ToddFuhrman,well make  personably responsible for the best parts of the show making it to digital available through the  account but worst case can always tune in on fox sports go mobile app
ToddFuhrman,a lot of work to do with the blues but always a massive sweat on the empty net; cant win the parlay without the first leg so lets see this thing through
ToddFuhrman,"that may as well be the wynn or bellagio compared to the top 2

keep wondering if  is going to put some in the lobby or on cardio equipment at some point"
ToddFuhrman,ha i ask because of the 60 minutes piece trying to cite the blacksox scandal and athletes being very susceptible to corruption so im curious to get an actual poll out there
ToddFuhrman,most interesting note watching the game last night that spurrier has won every game at every one of his first stops didn't think the offense would click right out of the gates
TheCousinSal,on an all-new thanksgiving edition of against all odds the degenerate trifecta and i preview nine week 13 nfl games and i really cant see us getting any of them wrong. #gambling
TheCousinSal,if i had a dollar for every time cris collinsworth said pash rusher i would still need thousands more to make up for what i lost on the chiefs money line tonight.
TheCousinSal,im not exactly sure how my  over 3.5 goals bet is going to lose. they need to change the rules so that hitting the post over 5 times counts as a score.
TheCousinSal,as a person who dabbles in pranks i have to say the  purposely not hitting when jacob degrom is on the hill continues to be the gold standard in practical jokes. #letsgomets
TheCousinSal,well that sucked. but im a good loser.  tomorrow morning im filing a lawsuit against that nfl officiating crew reckless interference of a contract.   let me know if you want to join.
TheCousinSal,georgia really effed this game up. they had several 4th and 4 at midfield that they punted into the end zone - only to  choose to fake on 4th and 11?  wow!
TheCousinSal,"im backing these fine young gentlemen in their quest for the heisman hardware. may god help them all...

dwayne haskins (ohio st.) 12/1 
kyler murray (okl) 15/1
justin herbert (oregon) 16/1

#gambling"
TheCousinSal,luka doncic wore an atlanta hawks cap for 11 minutes and 9 seconds which shatters the previous mark of anyone to ever wear an atlanta hawks cap by over 7 minutes. #nbadraft18
TheCousinSal,the reaching for the pylon that results in a fumble nonsense has to end. far too great a risk when the alternative is 1st and goal at the one inch line. #bearsbestbetbadbeat
12Xpert,but for sure if spain can do it in theory any county could do it if there is the will to change law. but those seeking change should understand the likely consequences.
12Xpert,yes. i'll say again. if the press  daily fantasy sports  agree with him in this country they are free to say so. stop believing his message was right and the press wrong.
12Xpert,"in which case you shouldnt have generalised to betting markets and made this specific to political betting markets.
i guess if sports modelling is so easy you must be a millionaire right?"
12Xpert,if i use 51 percent  instead and 641 then your number increases to 0.763. to get it to one we need 850 bets. hope it makes sense and i haven't messed up.
12Xpert,"i'm pissing myself laughing here. 

you and your kind give me endless abuse about trashing the hopes of amateurs and you accuse those using my methodology of giving false hope to amateurs."
12Xpert,actually to be fair i reported the earnings wage and not the real wage which appears to have remained close to unchanged over the period but way outside these two scenario forecasts.
12Xpert,"because i asked you to. if you  daily fantasy sports  put a time scale on it you'd presumably claim predictive success under any circumstances.

3 months? 12 months? 24 months? 5 years?"
12Xpert,"weekend main leagues data added: 
there is now a 'recent results' excel file for the main leagues. note that column headers for fouls data is in fact free kicks for belgium only."
12Xpert,i'd have to think about that. i find lays intuitively hard to get my head around which is why i turn them into backs for the purposes of analysing a bet history.
JambosPicks,we also send out weekly recaps that only include our paid packages.  even if we lose.  go back to week 2.  you will see us tweeting that we went down -19.77 units.
JambosPicks,we made a major miscalculation. we assumed people would research our company and understand this is completely legit but we are always happy to work to make this more clear for people.
JambosPicks,3. this one we will agree to disagree. we look at each play independently. if we have a big edge on both we believe our subscribers will want to play both. (3/4)
mschwimer,conference call in 10 minutes.  open to everyone.  please dm me any questions you have and i will not hang up until i answer every single (respectfully asked) question.  always full transparency!
mschwimer,oh i beg to differ. only one way to find out! let the listeners decide after we have a professional debate on the issues at hand. i am in. dont know about
mschwimer,"step 1. register for free
step 2. go to records page and click cumulative record. 
step 3. scroll to bottom to see how all plays did vs market line and closing line."
mschwimer,"iv been called worse. remember i was a shitty middle reliever that played in the city of philadelphia. 

but i will only speak the truth. people can call me what they want."
mschwimer,need to subscribe in order to see everything. subscribing is obviously free for everyone. but making the faq available for non subscribers is something i will consider. thank you for the suggestion.
mschwimer,for those not watching snell has 10 punchies in 4 innings. 20 is definitely in play if we were in the old school era and didnt care as much about pitch counts.
mschwimer,i better not hear one hater say that was a bad call. 100 percent  correct call. indisputable. for those who say let the players decide. they did. the player committed the foul.
RufusPeabody,there's a reason tout has a negative connotation in the industry. and there's an inherent conflict of interest with selling  daily fantasy sports  advice and playing  daily fantasy sports  yourself. ick.
RufusPeabody,you just told me she was a liar. and i haven't heard back from her that she has the refund. until then you do not get the benefit of the doubt.
RufusPeabody,if you knew you wouldn't convert and then the titans would score a  touchdown  on the very next play of course you wouldn't go for it. but you can't know that.
jeffma,it makes me laugh that  is going to come out of wearing rejected victoria secret's costumes in the desert for a week to 400 mentions on twitter all regarding this mess
SportsCheetah,works for me if you guys work out the logistics and how you submit picks to each other and track everything. i wont be able to deal with all of that.
SportsCheetah,like the one baylor game tells all? id wager heavily yards gained per down when leaving the pocket for hurts is well above nation-average let alone a weakness. will look later.
SportsCheetah,this week i laid out my chart for each week 14 matchup and looked back at why staying away from games with unfavorable weather conditions in week 13 paid off heavily
capjack2000,delaware was fun. can't be understated how remarkable that first season was when lines were purposely made to shade local teams. i'll try to dig up some of those old cards.
capjack2000,"damn.  really knows his stuff. i believe this episode sets the record on fewest words said by jake. 

it was a pleasure to listen to such a polished presentation of information."
capjack2000,"that one is a head-scratcher. for 98 percent  of bettors gambling is a negative expected value activity devoid of work ethic. 

maybe i can become the face of tennessee sports wagering."
capjack2000,if you have a smaller bankroll then you want to turn your money over faster. avoid locking money up in futures. just keep grinding. consider teaming up with a like mind.
capjack2000,the $1.69m in expenses is a bit concerning. i could see startup costs being rolled into that first month but i also see some troubling expenses for such a low-margin industry.
capjack2000,nv numbers will bare out a hold percent  of 8.5 percent  when they are released in about 2 weeks.  it is  more of a product of intramonth economics than bookmaking model.
capjack2000,"this picture doesn't help your case as it clearly says that for sports wagering the $600 and 300:1 threshold is applicable.  

the $5000 threshold applies only to the other lottery products."
capjack2000,"i agree wholeheartedly. not only are they one-sided but they are heavily skewed. you're not getting a competitive line even if you like an over. 

this is a bad look for"
capjack2000,you're working hard. i won't begrudge you that. there's a lot of competition for the affiliate dollar. do you plan to stay with a cpa model or move to revenue sharing?
capjack2000,"john randle placed a $93 bet on the twins -194 tonight to be the first bet at diamond jo casino in iowa.

capjack2000,"monday morning musing

slow day on the betting markets so heres a thread on 5 things that nj sportsbooks (or any state) could do this nfl season to increase engagement:

1/7"
capjack2000,"next you're going to tell me that retail poker rooms aren't profitable. 

sportsbooks have long been loss leaders to spur traffic. online books can be profit centers due to lower overhead."
capjack2000,"they lie because if joe bettor knew of the glass ceiling in sports betting he wouldnt want to wager. 

they advertise something they dont sell - never even had in stock."
capjack2000,in mlbs statement they said theyre in line with what is done in other international sports. does anyone have an example of an international sport that discloses information to sportsbooks first?
dinkinc,my two biggest pet peeves with the keyboard are 1.   the period and the comma keys should be reversed and 2. the question mark key should not require a shift ...
dinkinc,2-1 for the  horses.... this month has been producing unusual boxscores every day but today was the weirdest.... 4 games totally 5 runs at some very unexpected ballparks and pitching matchups
dinkinc,if we spend 20 minutes to determine if the 1 would have finished fifth or not we should go back to a foul is a foul... we will get there eventually
dinkinc,another one ..... man...i loved horse racing when it was thriving ... pretty much all that is left for me is saratoga and the reward i get from helping the   horses
robpizzola,tweeted this during real time not after we saw a million replays. im surprised you can still afford a phone to tweet from after that nfl season you had last year.
robpizzola,"titans offense is 2.5 yards per play today lmaooooo

pretty sure i can assemble an offense of people that i follow on twitter and put together a better number than that."
robpizzola,russell wilson is shorter than drew brees. doug baldwin 5-10 tyler lockett 5-10 golden tate 5-10 jermaine kearse 6-1 paul richardson 6-0 have been his main receivers for the last decade.
robpizzola,i dont think im as high on the devils as everyone else is. theres definitely potential there and i can totally see it but i still think theyre a bit away.
robpizzola,just ran into  at #bosamerica in jersey. dude is walking around like a tourist with the conference play sheet in his hand circling all the talks he wants to attend lollll
RASPicks,i agree with almost everything that rufus  and many others say about touts. i just wish they would not always completely ignore the exceptions to the general advice that they give.
RASPicks,two weeks ago was our worst closing line value of the season and we went 5-2.  last week was our best closing line value of the season and we went 3-4.
VegasRefund,"creighton -3

7 sec left (up 5): $$$

1 sec left (tied ot): oh can possibly cover now though..
ot: creighton loses"
VegasRefund,"michigan has literally zero shot
nova is going to decapitate them
nova is free money

just a few of the comments ive heard today.. as most of you have as well."
suuma810,agree that it was more than one would expect but 20 runs vs 36 passes on 2nd  10 is still a bad ratio when you consider the discrepancies in success rate.
suuma810,the #patriots are 17-5 against the spread as short home favorites under a touchdown since 2010. this includes a meaningless week 17 loss in 2014 when garoppolo played a full half.
suuma810,"best  worst defensive ypp differentials for home/road splits:

1. #seahawks +1.5 (better d in road games)
2. #chargers +0.8
3. #steelers +0.7

30. #vikings -1.3
31. #jaguars -1.5
32. #bucs -1.5"
suuma810,he ranked top-5 in pressure rate. actually had the same rate as joe thomas according to pff. sf got rid of him because he isnt suited for shannys zone blocking scheme.
ClevTA,prob not. that perkins stepped up nicely last week at least as a #2 option. to me a healthy ertz makes this philly -2.5/3 and without i have it philly -1.5.
ClevTA,sutton has been a monster this year with awful qbs. sill pissed that the browns passed on sutton for corbett. was begging the browns to draft him. he has it all
ClevTA,to be fair i didnt watch the whole gm so maybe im speaking out of turn but there was a comparable qb in that same wind who wasnt nearly as awful
ClevTA,no not having an rb who is averaging 3.8 ypc and has one game over 55 yards is not a big loss. james conner has zero impact on this game today
ClevTA,ha apparently. anyone who bets nba every single night has problems lol.  it is  a death march. i like to pick tv games and random good spots but far from daily
ClevTA,was terrible kiid. horrible clock management. throwing to the ez there is perfectly fine but the goal was to bleed clock score  not let russ get the ball back. he failed
ClevTA,easily. all he had to do was dump it a few times to get ppl off his trail. not be a hero every time but i guess that was the point
ClevTA,"last 6 road gms (sb included) for goff:
56 percent  completions 6.08 ypa 4  touchdown  8 int
he has zero 300+ yard games on the road since early november last season"
ClevTA,bc its the nfl and these are pros so anything for the most part can happen. simien started like 25 gms so its not as if hes some no name scrub

spanky,"im supposed to start the  show soon. 

i feel weird talking to myself for a long period of time.

i have no idea where to start. 

im lost. 

looking for answers."
spanky,been a big fan of the  guys since literally day one at the grand opening.  i wish    and all the guys continued success on being bookmakers who welcome all customers. respect
spanky,the investment is supposed to equal the amount one can potentially lose given an 0-for wipeout.  you are reinvesting the money daily but are not accounting for the previous days losses...
spanky,"yet they continue to thrive and expand.  

my voice seems useless. 

our state governments will continue to support companies that resort to the extreme measure of kicking out their citizens. sad."
spanky,you guys love joking around. i think you all have a circle jerk every morning and then decide who the target of the day is.  ease up fellas. be nice sometimes.
spanky,you aint breaking my balls.  i definitely have a long relationship with them. but im hearing from lots of guys on here that they have no problem. to each his own
spanky,back in 2010 coast property gave my guy a nickel on world cup final.  soccer aint popular in the us. you cant blame us bookmakers for not taking a big pop.
spanky,were lucky to have any kind of dime line anywhere. many moons ago a huge meeting was held by some of the worlds top bookmakers to ban the dime line altogether.
spanky,spoken by one of the sharpest legends in the business. its pretty crazy when you think about it - you coulda bet more money in 1999 than you can in 2019.
spanky,i agree with your point.  however i also believe slip ups like these are a sign of the times.  domestic us sportsbooks will always play second fiddle to the offshore sportsbooks.
DocBettor,lot of opportunities in the current in-play betting market. during the most recent lakers/suns commercial break different operators were showing anywhere from 236.5 to 240.5 as the baseline live in-game total.
PlusEVAnalytics,if you think the point spread had anything to do with the decision you must be one of those to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail guys.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes...but theoretically if youre not running a long term bank and dont care about sustainability then you should just bet as much as possible on the bet with the largest ev...
PlusEVAnalytics,in case anyone doubts my domain knowledge in the field of tennis kyrgios is the guy i referred to on  as whats the name of that maniac who always goes nuts
PlusEVAnalytics,its not even a question of intelligence. decision making under probabilistic uncertainty is not something the human brain has evolved to be competent at unless youve studied and learned to be.
PlusEVAnalytics,its the only bet ive ever heard of where you can take the dog plus the points and lose on an outright win. are you trying to own me online benjamin?
PlusEVAnalytics,ah ok it seems that ive wandered into a tangent. carry on then. id never do that if i was a bookie because it makes me extremely fragile to adverse selection.
aluckyaday,how robust is using the harmonic mean for the average odds? mine is 3.03 which results in a k of 21 quite a bit below the actual losing run of 25.
aluckyaday,it is a very good sign that you will be profitable. markets are generally more efficient at close than opening as more information is available. a couple of articles on it.
aluckyaday,just because the ball goes forward it does not mean it is a forward pass. maybe as you like to comment on rugby so much you should actually learn the rules
aluckyaday,anyone who has worked in a betting shop know when this error would be picked up?  are there extra checks on big wins or would the normal settling process detect it?
aluckyaday,"ooops retweeted the wrong one so deleted the retweet not realising that actually deletes the original tweet! week 3 has 
 now disappeared from the timeline  i'll be attracting the tout haters."
aluckyaday,if it is like europe then it will be consolidation rather than contraction. the most profitable brands will take over the less profitable ones to get access to their client base.
aluckyaday,those two punters both can only bet on the exchange. where does the money come from to pay them their long term winnings and cover the running costs of the exchange?
aluckyaday,colossus bet pools is an interesting one their syndicate captain system. as a captain you are getting pretty big +ev if you can find people stupid enough to follow your selections.
aluckyaday,"the people it hurts most are ""pros"" hence spankys complaints. it actually benefits recreational players. they get many more prop bets which they enjoy plus loads of  free bets and offers."
aluckyaday,your j-league data does look like a definite change. my comments were more in reference to  point that said he had seen bigger margins when one team was a large favorite.
aluckyaday,"""providing them with a level of care and a quality of life that is virtually unsurpassed by any other domesticated animal"" i think millions of pet owners would dispute that statement!"
joeytunes2,really gussied out on the under in cleveland tonight. ugh. but overall we killed it. det fh was solid play. the lines moved 6 points. on info of stafford  not playing.
joeytunes2,exactly if you only wanna air move and kick out winners you are what you are. dont give a buffet to a skinny guy and not a fat guy. own it
joeytunes2,he got me the best part was the feds called me. and i never awnsered. lol. and they were like hey  discovered tour tickets. you must not need the money. hahah
joeyisaks,a bookmaker told me about the trend in like 2009.. this isnt some new revelation / a really stupid reason to bet on something/ kinda sums up action network though sadly
joeyisaks,haha anthony come on do u know what a fix even is? its a sportsbook knowing the $ itll generate from this free publicity outweighs the small amount lost on blues
EdMillerPoker,darren would you be willing to pledge to help this kid get back on his feet should his luck turn and he finds himself with some financial problems due to losses?
EdMillerPoker,we wont really have made it until we have a win probability expert expert on air who can tell you if the win probability expert is full of it or not
EdMillerPoker,dont know if itll be this fellow or someone else but someones gonna build a massive tout business with a similar model thatll blow up big enough to stop a hurricane
EdMillerPoker,i guess im saying your beef should be more with amazon and not andrew. also andrew theres still time to hang a $49.99 on that puppy the price point of champions.
EdMillerPoker,i dont know what needs to be done to reduce the latency but i gotta figure that if they build this theyll figure out soon enough that latency matters a ton?
EdMillerPoker,there's a zillion games and the limits are much lower and almost no one in europe bets it and for sure  it is  less efficient. halftimes/in game also very much so.
EdMillerPoker,right it doesnt require an altruistic donor but an altruistic donor substantially increases the possible viable combinations. i think as usual a big hurdle is figuring who pays what for whom.
EdMillerPoker,my favorite part of this article is where the author repeatedly shoehorned  in as the foil to gates even though he never mentioned her and hes talking only about policy concepts.
EdMillerPoker,also i think extremely few today appreciate the potentially massive effect seemingly small differences in market composition and regulatory environments will do to the size and viability of various competitive niches
EdMillerPoker,well yes a govt run monopoly with 9 figure prize pools on a skill-free game works. competing with that and trying to apply it to skill-based games imo works less well.
EdMillerPoker,pitched my first poker book to a few ppl who rejected it. ppl who apparently thought 3 months after moneymaker won the wsop that a new poker book was a loser
GolcondaFund,"look 5 touchdown  passes vs week one dolphins is cool and all but lj throwing 59 times is never going to amount to anything in case you had any doubts.

#titans"
GolcondaFund,i gotta give credit to  all off-season he had 49ers at 13-3 on the season. i started at 7 got to 10 by end of pre-season. looking very sharp so far.
nonrandomalpha,more #sec talent showing up and demonstrating the #niners are deeper at wr than many expected and have priced into the market. more sec talent? see jalen hurd the bulldozer #bullish
nonrandomalpha,this is vintage russell wilson.  if kyler can be more wilson and less vick he could have an extended successful career. the zip of his throws is a thing of beauty.
LeeSharpeNFL,"tired: the seahawks are the cowboys are the seahawks

wired: seahawks are 12-3 and in the playoffs cowboys are 8-8 and not.

inspired: seahawks are -1 point differential cowboys are +113"
LeeSharpeNFL,packers had 4th and 4 on the 14 with 0:27 left in half down 14 points and kicked the field goal to go from down 2 scores to down 2 scores.
LeeSharpeNFL,week 17 is super fluky so after week 16 i'm glad i at least managed to get in the top 10 percent  to finish out the season after a rough start.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i do feel for the officials it hard to call those correctly in real time. 

being on the negative side of that variance in an emotional game sure is frustrating though."
LeeSharpeNFL,really happy the bears are hosting a workout for dak prescott tomorrow night at soldier field. always good to get your starting qb for next year familiar with the environment early!
LeeSharpeNFL,"each team's movement from before vs. after last week (week 13) of its chances to...

1) make the playoffs
2) win their division
3) get a bye
4) earn homefield advantage"
LeeSharpeNFL,i am impressed with your desire to own the libs by rooting against your own team's interest if it final;y proves once and for all that aaron rodgers is not elite.
LeeSharpeNFL,"somebody replied to this by guessing this page's url and then deciding it was there's to browse and play with.

whale_capper,"this is a great question and generally trying to prove ""motivational"" spots in the nfl is so subjective that  it is  not very meaningful but i think we have to ask..."
whale_capper,you nailed one of the most interesting observations... the numbers are an average of the look ahead lines weeks 1-16 and overall the browns are way under lined across the board...
whale_capper,more like dig a hole and throw 99 percent  in there but if youre in the 1 percent  that has a legit edge you can do whatever you want with it
whale_capper,yeah this is still relatively wide open but i do think dubs hold at home and holding gsw series gives some flexibility to swing away at tor g5 g6 and g7
whale_capper,yeah  that is  tough... somewhat of a leap of faith that pop has one more adjustment to deploy and denver will come in with the same look they've been rolling with

JoeyKnish22,got a text from buddy who noticed this as well. potentially deal with staff he got 2k then pulled. well know first series of 2h if hes out there or not.
JoeyKnish22,hope youre right lock. maybe im misreading the vibe but it seems harbaugh has some more media buzz. i agree tomlin making a strong case hoping pitt falls off here late.
JoeyKnish22,all the bears teasers and alts today. the lions had one positive thing going on the entire team (staffords play) and theyre on literally their 4th backup qb of this season.
JoeyKnish22,tough to see  looking like this havent seen him this upset since hayward wouldnt sign his maga hat at a celtics preseason game. hopefully pats bounce back for him this week.
JoeyKnish22,"more mls playoffs tonight:
split a unit on philly +1 (-130) and +0.5 (+125)
also .5u on u3.25 (-120) 

nothing for me on el trafico classico just gonna enjoy the spectacle."
JoeyKnish22,we just needed mr. big chest to keep it together and not completely lose it for a couple more days and that fucking lunatic couldnt even make it to game 1.
JoeyKnish22,like any good old school caveman manball coach im sure at the first sign of any spread system fault hell revert to power footbaw and ruin the season with fullback dives.
JoeyKnish22,maybe if you buy a michigan jersey and say some nice things about harbaugh ill send you a few picks so you can make your money back from that lsu bet.
JoeyKnish22,forced to buy out cause the syndicate smashed my release into oblivion right back at me fixed it for ya. fuck outta here. cooked ya like a cheap ballpark on grill
JoeyKnish22,kawhi is returning. west is wide open and plenty of futures value to be had. and many many people have burned money on lakers futures at what are now atrocious prices.
TheKostos,devante owning gilmore today would make me very nervous if i were planning to bet ne. if they  daily fantasy sports  trust gilmore solo against aj brown  that is  a problem
TheKostos,that was one of the dumbest plays i've ever seen. dirty af and incredibly stupid in that he should have been going for burrow instead. so so so so so dumb
TheKostos,huge  coming up 9am et with   and me... we'll hit all the games today all the the line moves and all the fantasy/ daily fantasy sports  to help you win $$

TheKostos,really feel like the nfl bullshit evening out. was such a disappointing nfl season for me that i felt things had to turn around. nba has been great. thankful for that.
TheKostos,the texans somehow not covering +10 with a 24-0 lead was only the second most annoying beat of the day lmao. gotta love the nfl. feast one week famine the next

DannyParkins,obviously the packers havent played yet so this is fluid but the early line at the westgate superbook for next week has the bears a 7 point underdog in green bay.
DannyParkins,they blew a call in the nfc championship game and as a result created a new rule that fixes that problem but in the process created 50 new ones. great job.
DannyParkins,43 seconds and 2 timeouts i bet nagy is gonna be real conservative here. mitch hasn't shown any reason to have faith in letting him drop back or take some shots.
DannyParkins,if you missed our conversation with theo you need to seek it out. i've never quite heard him like that. we'll replay it at 5:00 and talk through it all now.
DannyParkins,lack of depth. lack of playing time together. youth. we dont know what free agents are gonna go east. still lots of reasons bulls are an underdog to make the playoffs.
DannyParkins,oh man kd heading to the locker room. steph now would be a good time to snap outta whatever the hell funk this is or the warriors are in real trouble.
DannyParkins,this would be so much fun and is exactly the type of hyper-aggressive move ryan pace has become known for. will his market fall into the bears budget is the question...
DannyParkins,the president of the nfl player's union is a smart thoughtful guy who is always a great interview. pumped to be joined by eric winston at 5:00  to talk nfl issues.
DannyParkins,im taking it personally that trevor lawrence had the worst game of his career in the title game and patrick mahomes is having the worst of his in the super bowl.
DannyParkins,nick foles a generational talent? you can win one super bowl a lot of ways. id try to do it the way that if you really hit you contend every year.
chadmillman,the time  was invited to a party by phil mickelson and wound up being one of several people who lost a big bet to lefty that night. quick colorful insider read.
Gingfacekillah,i really like hearing creative solutions like this. you never know what youll find unless you try out your ideas. learning from every single experiment is a strong foundation for success
Gingfacekillah,with that in mind i'll probably focus on bky/uta. both teams are likely to play close to their mean expectation making a statistical forecast more likely than not to be useful.
Gingfacekillah,taking a break on games today. spent most of last night working on mlb modelling and all day today studying tax  evidence law. my brain is cooked. back at it tomorrow.
Gingfacekillah,i mean its not as easy as just loudly asserting i can beat 1.90 odds at a 70 percent  rate but its seems like the better path to statistically significant results

logan_matthews9,"alex is mostly right but some smaller books especially locals dont have their distributions right and you can get value. 

but paying a quarter for a half point is not good"

PikachuBets,in this episode we'll take a look at how the nba  gathers his market information which apparently is through crowdsourcing line movement news from reddit!!! man what a goat he is
PikachuBets,buy glasses? or at least have spares you can wear. go to a high-end glasses store where someone with a clue can find you a pair that fit your face properly
PikachuBets,how is this great stuff lol its only for mls and has a ton of unnecessary rows that are just clutter. also doesnt break out vig closing line value vs nvclv
PikachuBets,"tan always introduced you as an ""nfl expert"" lol but sure yeah  let us  deny it now that 1) you got fired and 2) we're fishing out your poor gambling record!"
PikachuBets,is this a joke? did your counsel just graduate law school? there are ways to mitigate that and anyone who has ever hired counsel to talk anti-nuisance would know. come on
PikachuBets,this is fucking embarrassing and you know it. but then again you got your mybookie referral link spammed all over your twitter so what the fuck did anyone expect anyway. pathetic
PikachuBets,fouling when down 6 with 8.8 seconds left is some goddamn  college basketball  bullshit. ind should be ashamed of itself for being a little crybaby doing that shit. rip +7.5 bettors
PikachuBets,thankfully  it is  10 minutes before tipoff which allows me to capture the best value in the line since we have near perfect information at that time. remember efficiency = cash
PikachuBets,forgive me father for i have sinned. i tweeted about a non-gambling thing for the first time ever i think and now my notifications are getting rimmed. i regret everything lol
adamchernoff,i read all of your tweets with a heavy german accent and therefore can not tell if there is a sarcastic under tone but knowing how smart you are i assume...yes?
adamchernoff,hey glad to hear you say that. its nice of them to let me come on and chat football. looking forward to another spot with them on friday. thanks for listening.
adamchernoff,we are getting highly speculative here but if you beat the market consistently at any decent volume (# of bets placed) over 10 years youre going to make a comfortable living.
adamchernoff,two for two winning weeks out of the gate in my weekly mls column for  readers get well ahead of the number and cash in on real salt lake this afternoon.
adamchernoff,"my fault for misreading the market early in the week and not anticipating dal -1. i paid the price but just an annoying way to lose. 

on to the ravens tomorrow."
adamchernoff,i am putting it at the end of my condensed game rewatch list for the week. might watch it back on 2x speed and see if it gets any more entertaining.
Ccon8181,seen this movie a million times. #oregon goes down gets the dramatic touchdown for the cover. book it. wisk will have one last shot for  field goal  but wont cover. #rosebowlgame

Ccon8181,i dont like the 2nd half lines for the side or total in this #dukevsunc game.. gonna let it ride and hopefully it plays out well for the good guys. #duke
Ccon8181,classic #clemson .. in control could pull away but start with the antics and go prevent late in the half.. done things never change. put them in the category with louisville.
Ccon8181,yea but doc was looking to pull lou and dj but wiz kept em around. could have blown the doors off em but shot 22 percent  from 3 at home.tough loss
Ccon8181,i own it when i lose and had the worst # college basketball  season on record finishing 4 games below .500 but more then made up for it with #nba season
kellyinvegas,regarding my last two season win totals. need steelers with next week for a push (hoping ravens sit everyone ) and cowboys to lose for a winner. push is worst case.
ToddFuhrman,still very curious to see what earnings look like for all the new operators knowing how much marketing spend is going into the pa and nj battlegrounds from the biggest players
ToddFuhrman,the multiple major marketing deals signed recently between gaming operators and media outlets further illustrates sports betting is here to stay;  it is  an exciting time for everyone in the space
ToddFuhrman,"dragging out ""drama"" over a 7 game series in the nba loses a lot of luster in comparison to the finality of a one and done unless  it is  a finals."
ToddFuhrman,pretty sure that got me in trouble back in the day you'd have told me back in 2005 a home playoff game vs middlebury was in the offering i'd have laughed
ToddFuhrman,here's the thing...if that was going to happen taking out of the legal betting markets won't stop it so mlb thinking it being unavailable in nevada changes anything is beyond naieve
ToddFuhrman,there's no right or wrong way to handicap a sporting event; everyone has a different approach and at the end of the day the only scoreboard that matters is your bankroll

TheCousinSal,im aware that this is going to stir up some controversy - but if a jockey falls off his horse at the starting gate that jockey should be put down. #fairisfair
TheCousinSal,betting the nba has become impossible. case in point the defending champion warriors cant even win a home game vs. the celtics - a team thats been tanking since late 2018.
TheCousinSal,of the degenerate trifecta is betting that there will be under 333 total points scored in the nba all-star game.  question: is there a more agonizing sports wager to root for?

12Xpert,it makes sense but intuitively something still doesnt seem right. would be interested to see what the median xpts are for xgd = 0. this i would expect to be 1.
12Xpert,and here's the average. i should say that the analysis data start in august 1995 and omit the first two seasons where there were more than 38 games in a season.
12Xpert,i agree with the spending plans (apart from the silly stuff about renationalisation).  it is  how you credibly pay for it without massive increasing national debt and wrecking investment that matters.
12Xpert,to be fair to  he's one of the few who i think knows what he is doing. but the number that fall into this category is 1 percent  in my opinion.
12Xpert,you will be welcome in my debating cafe where there are only two rules: no abuse and debaters have to adopt a position they would normally oppose vehemently and defend it.
12Xpert,but everyone else can see the teams performing too. and if you interpret those things in the same ways that everyone else is  it is  just the same as pre-match no?
12Xpert,i'm afraid i have to disappoint you and say i have no idea. perhaps  might be able to help i believe his has been doing a bit of machine learning lately.
12Xpert,this is what is called regression to the mean. most important lesson a punter should learn short of knowing not to chase losses and burning money they can't afford to lose.

jeffma,heres the final word on  while  may have really tried to be different the results and actions really are just like every other tout and sadly in some cases worse
jeffma,no one saying how dumb pederson's first half challenge was which caused him to be afraid to challenge that non-catch. still can't believe we lost a super bowl to him
jeffma,now  let us  change the game so that when tails comes up you roll a fair 10 sided die and you can bet on heads or one of the numbers
SportsCheetah,the ball doesnt hit until the bottom of the net. its usually pretty instant relative to when it goes past the bars. would bet it was good for a lot.
SportsCheetah,yeah kemba went out with about 2 minutes left in the 1q should be similar again and maybe less than 60 percent  3s out of philly this next time around.

ClevTA,also that 6.9 ypa would rank 24th in the nfl at qb and 25th in pass rating at 89 so its not like those qbs are lighting up anyone else
ClevTA,but i was relentlessly mocked a few weeks ago about my longshot 80-1 mvp. vikes keep winning and u never know? like a 3 percent  shot is all i need
ClevTA,there are 6 guys in the backfield every single time fournette gets the ball and its his fault. cant wait to see the yards before contact for the jags tonight
ClevTA,omg im catching up on todays show and they had duhamel on and replayed the clip for him of ryan hollins saying the robots were racist in transformers. so good
CizzlingSports,"they were not but that doesn't matter when you bet monopoly money at a book that doesn't charge juice and gives you free half points.

# worst of all time"
spanky,youre obviously right. he cant be happy he blew the season.  but keeping your emotions in check i think woulda been more classy. smiling just isint cool in my opinion.
spanky,despite ac leading the way the aggregate vote of nyc and hoboken makes hoboken the best compromise.  my pal  is great at organizing this stuff and hell have details soon.
spanky,dont worry greg. these guys mean well. theyve been busting my balls since i came on here. they just hate touts with a passion - albeit sometimes an unhealthy one.
spanky,in the past ive waited almost 3 minutes for approval.  the action i put now is limited as i am waiting on a response from ceo if delays are gone...
spanky,thank you gentlemen.  im looking forward to it.  do you mind posting the straigh bet sides/totals limits for nflcfnbacb?   given the opportunity ill make that duffle bag guy look tiny
spanky,crazy.... harrahs and fanduel are the only 2 joints in the entire state that i havent heard any boot stories about... so much for regulated sports betting. what a joke
PlusEVAnalytics,i was about to pat myself on the back for producing enough quality content for enough years to earn 5000 followers. then i saw that ben the bettor has 5279.
PlusEVAnalytics,for any given set of prior estimates of the likelihood of each option we can run the actual observed results through bayes theorem to get a set of posterior estimates.
PlusEVAnalytics,no it would be a bit different for a linear regression...hard to help you without understanding how your model works linear regressions and probability models generally dont go well together
PlusEVAnalytics,again its semantics whether you get there by reducing your theoretical edge or by betting fractional kelly. same result. what matters is how you figure out what fraction to use.
PlusEVAnalytics,"raps gonna get swept kawhi gonna leave siakam gonna regress we have no draft pick and no free agents want to come here.
other than that were in great shape"
PlusEVAnalytics,maybe. a question for the data to tell us would be how much of that effect is real and how much is our own cognitive bias from watching these matches.
PlusEVAnalytics,also krack is the betting equivalent of one of those extreme couponing guys...nothing wrong with it but its more about work ethic patience and free time than any real skill.
aluckyaday,traditional bookmaking is very niche and not as profitable as recreational bookmaking in a regulated market. asking them to take your bets is like asking you not to line shop.
aluckyaday,the fact that a business won't deal with you because you are not profitable for them is quite a long way down my list of what is morally objectionable .
aluckyaday,they are not vegas bookmakers. they are online recreational bookmakers. their target market is very very different. its a completely different business. you seem to be struggling with this concept.
aluckyaday,this is an interesting one.  it has always puzzled me how anyone can set up a book using fsb's licence  and not be subject to the usual gambling commission checks.
aluckyaday,too much is made of inside information. if the information is not known by those setting the market. then its effect is basically random and will even out long term.
aluckyaday,interestingly enough most operators seem to have limits in place already but they have been ineffective. the gc has issued new guidelines on how to implement safer gambling checks already
aluckyaday,i was more interested how the run line has changed from open rather than betting them. trying to train a moneyline system to see if it could predict line movement.
aluckyaday,i think they should run the stage in reverse. see if alla can get enough back on the descent and then if the rest can catch him on the flat!
aluckyaday,did you look at profit using opening odds rather than closing? that might help to determine if bookmakers are specifically targeting this bias by adjusting their true odds at open?

joeytunes2,"yes  it is  great to have these props for losers. but the people who have the edge get 10 dollars. 

i'd put out anything too if i cant get hurt."
joeyisaks,i disagree but well never know... sampras had rafter rusedski henman  guys who were comfortable moving forward ... fed has clay courters and guys more comfortable 6 feet behind baseline
joeyisaks,ok ok . im done being a jerk. was simply pointing out that things like that you say to uneducated listener is misleading and vsin should be better than that
EdMillerPoker,"history tells us that every year we dont have an all-consuming global war or a worldwide pandemic is a good year.

2019 was a good year and heres to 2020"
EdMillerPoker,for example a prominent in-game odds provider in the last few minutes made a ball at the wrong yardline error that you could spot via the methods in the book.
EdMillerPoker,its hard to believe how bad i am at twitter given how much time i spend on it unless you are familiar with the rest of my body of work
EdMillerPoker,the idea that you can make money by improving the efficiency of something or exploiting an inefficiency is seductive but there's usually less inefficiency and more friction than you think
EdMillerPoker,obviously true for all existing markets but i dont see why if there were a real liquid market widely available that an election is substantially different from a sporting event.
GolcondaFund,"gotta love to see it.
tebow hype we all knew tebow was a run 1st qb.

lj hype they all refuse to accept he is a run 1st qb.

GolcondaFund,"didn't see anyone on hawaii so took them in tease alt line -3.5 then live byu +4.5.

sometimes i just play numbers for numbers sake knowing the market really doesn't."
nonrandomalpha,why are you so desperate to find isolated incidents to tout this bum? do you care more about the team and winning or just love sick with one individual player?
nonrandomalpha,"your limited universe of posts can be broken down into 4 buckets: 1. lamar hardon 2. kap bitchfest 3. cam hardon 4. puking on kyle allen. 

you got anything else?"
nonrandomalpha,it wasnt an innocuous football tweet it was a foolhardy attempt at political grandstanding. the former doesnt engage in morality shaming. go dunk on pleebs in the huff post comments.
nonrandomalpha,were they aggressive v saints? were they aggressive v packers when game was close? the playcalling has clearly been questionable the last two games when playing much more difficult teams.
nonrandomalpha,jackson buying into his own hype  love it - the reversion to standard operating jackson in the weeks to come v no the dolphins will be a delight to see
LeeSharpeNFL,this is still the strangest thing about the 2019 bears to me. for much of the season the best part of trubisky's game seemed like it was simply forgotten about.
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  disagree. bal is a uniquely schemed team  that is  probably causing an undervaluation by me. but i think 21 percent  is closer than 46 percent .
LeeSharpeNFL,"the afc south doesn't get a lot of attention but the ebbs and flows of its division were actually quite interesting this year.

the titans almost made an unlikely comeback!"
LeeSharpeNFL,the chances of winning that challenge were very low. late in the game i'd challenge it but here i think not challenging is fine despite the large amount of leverage.
LeeSharpeNFL,yes the former is what i was trying to say probably could have phrased better. (though of course cpoe isn't quite thst simple since you're evaluating against each pass's expectation.)
LeeSharpeNFL,if you look at public snap count data and focus on plays later in the game from the bdb you should be able to control for this effect i suspect.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""in conclusion dad when you consider the roi of my time a c was actually the right grade for me to shoot for in this class. i appreciate your understanding."""
LeeSharpeNFL,few. the failure though comes from not making the effort to find someone good who you can outsource this to.  that is  part of the qualities you list in parenthesis.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it is  not your imagination the seahawks really do have the games with the most high-wp-changing plays. lions are close.

and patriots and jets games really truly are that boring."
LeeSharpeNFL,"someone tell me because i'm never experienced this:

what is it like to have your qb throw the ball like 40 yards down field and be excited instead of panicing?"
LeeSharpeNFL,the only thing keeping the bears in this game is matt patricia's cowardly punting decisions which are particularly embarrassing given the quality of offense it suggests he is worried about.
AndyMSFW,your model might want to bet seattle moneyline since  it is  showing like a 20 percent  edge.  i'll let seth handle how many dollars full kelly wants you to wager.
AndyMSFW,you should explain what a 15 percent  hold means for people that  daily fantasy sports  know enough to understand how fucking laughable that is and how outraged they should be.
AndyMSFW,just figured out that there are only 108 regular season football games left this year and it gave me a tummy ache.   let us  cherish these last 7 weeks. #thursdaythoughts
AndyMSFW,"1513.5
i  daily fantasy sports  know about you but i  daily fantasy sports  see anything that should have a guy worried about their play calling from the 2 yard line."
AndyMSFW,hope you win enough to be happy but not so much that you make dumb nba bets with all the cash! (also you'll have to tell darth to unblock me)
AndyMSFW,they say recovery from an injury like that is mental too.  he doesn't look fully comfortable yet a little tentative.  they can't all bounce back like tom terrific i guess.
AndyMSFW,"the best part of friday is the cut!
today's h2h's went 1-1

JoeyKnish22,had a great time talking shop with the fellas today. some background on me couple fun stories and we touch on bowl szn bangers. give it a listen and rate/review/subscribe.
JoeyKnish22,i told the guys we can start doing video. im a bit sensitive for account protection on identity but if i can get it set up will start doing video.
JoeyKnish22,folks please direct your trolling here  when they get shut out. ive got dinner plans anyway dont need to be reading akron sucks tweets from you idiots while im eating.
JoeyKnish22,my grandma (dead pour one out ) used to buy scratch offs every single time she was at the gas station she never made a sports bet in her life.
JoeyKnish22,can you guys pull the jets off the board so i dont lose anymore money on taking awful jets lookahead lines? my family and therapist both encouraged me to ask.
JoeyKnish22,circa really changing the game in so many ways. openers yes/no bets and now comped food if you agree to tail my losing mls bets. place is revolutionizing the industry.
TheKostos,goldberg almost killed undertaker and then almost killed bray but yeah give him a mania main event at the expense of the best character they've had in a long time

LockyLockerson,youre trying so hard to troll when all ive said is the trend is worthless.  wisconsin is destroying michigan and thats totally something that always could have happened ya know?
LockyLockerson,i  daily fantasy sports  play contests so i  daily fantasy sports  have a good answer but maybe people who follow me have a better feel for the rules/entrants and stuff!
LockyLockerson,this was a team that had every indicator in the world that they should be really good again and they were most decidedly not good. can't predict a lot sometimes.
LockyLockerson,all good i think people get the wrong idea sometimes (maybe your or my followers) that these prices are signals as opposed to really low-limit props. have a pleasant evening!

DannyParkins,because that no talent hack  is easy to miss thats how. its not like hes versatile smart hilarious or any other positive quality hes just a bully with a microphone.
DannyParkins,no i dont they were bad too. the one against the broncos was just too late in the game to overcome. bears dont win if they dont get that penalty.
DannyParkins,getting ready for another double dip. thrilled to be in for  on  the great  joins me at 10am ct. then  it is   where    guest star. they pay me for this.
DannyParkins,well you've now tweeted me twice in the last 90 seconds on a sunday night so you must care about me a little. i appreciate ya have a good day.
DannyParkins,i mean he finished 2nd in the mvp is a back to back all star and an elite defensive player; hes awesome. just all or nothing approach at the plate.
DannyParkins,if the reports are true that the bears have back to back thursday games late in the season without a bye week beforehand thats not gonna be popular with players.
DannyParkins,also #morningthrones is gonna be an emotional rollercoaster dodging spoilers while on air and waking up and watching the episode before coming in for the afternoon show but i think

chadmillman,something new: the first podcast w/pro athletes talking about betting: inside the locker room how it looks to them who they like.  and  host embrace the sweat. go get it!
chadmillman,"question for a story answers may be used in piece: what would you rather do (eg. pay taxes) or bet (eg. darts) than bet the pro bowl? 

ready ... go"
Gingfacekillah,this out-sample roc curve  for the nba looks pretty good until you realize the books are generally 1 percent  ahead of you. important to keep these model benchmarks in mind.
Gingfacekillah,i am currently running a design competition for the cover of my upcoming book. please take a look at the front runners and vote for the one you like best!
logan_matthews9,no he wouldnt have. and even if thats true the cycle of constantly firing coaches after a short run of bad results is a huge waste of time and resources.
logan_matthews9,i dont use ras but if i did id use multiple outs. as it is i was on my phone and only got one bet in before the lines shifted
PikachuBets,this is so dumb and the fact that youre gobbling up this bullshit marketing tactic of his really shows how intelligent you are which is to say not at all
PikachuBets,not saying who is or who isn't but both of them also thought at some point i'm dan which i find hilariously funny and also sad at the same time
PikachuBets,i agree cris. big fan btw of you and your employer. keep up the great work tweeting out hockey/soccer plays without notating the juice you got. looks successful. ty effort
PikachuBets,no problem nothing is non-negotiable before we both agree on the conditions. counter with your conditions and we'll work it out this doesn't seem like a difficult deal to do.

adamchernoff,the listener base of mitch and pauly stretches far and wide haha! good to hear there are more folks in the city that follow their show too. thanks for listening.
adamchernoff,not sure. seems like it might? only thing i know for sure is that the surface is being used for the first time for a sporting event and is untested.
adamchernoff,fun episode this morning announcing the contest winner as well as looking at a early bet to get into your account for sunday (which is still available in some spots).
adamchernoff,another favourable result with lar cle under 50 1/2 to wrap up a 7-0 sunday. doesn't happen often. bigger stake sitting on the total tomorrow in monday night football .
adamchernoff,in my experience my most profitable fantasy football strategy l is to withdraw all of my money from the fantasy website and then deposit it back into my sportsbook accounts.
adamchernoff,my bad. forgot about the same guys that bet horse racing every day of the year but just dont post online or talk about it ever except for the derby.

ToddFuhrman,thats what makes it more incredible when you consider  used a figure that he might get to a handful of times. number even more staggering if you went 100 obviously
ToddFuhrman,spot on...playing cupcakes doesn't get anyone ready for prime time.  will be interesting to see how dabo's boys respond but they did get a scare vs unc which always helps

ToddFuhrman,unfortunately if you're seeking true odds for any in-play market laying the favorite is always going to put you in a better situation for value than taking long shot dogs
ToddFuhrman,can someone explain to alex that going 3-2-1 every 6 games as a bettor puts you in rarefied air and lets you live on a beach somewhere...think he's confused #math
ToddFuhrman,tomlin...because butler wasn't behind the 3 points the offense mustered so when your team isn't ready on either side of the ball the hc as ceo has to wear it
ToddFuhrman,incredible that  still can't get this resolved going to lose a ton of sports fans here in the desert and in  neighborhood too.  good thing dtv offers us  ...hmm nevermind
ToddFuhrman,and the other reality on top of that if there is an appetite for the market it won't come from the players that most shops want to deal to anyways
ToddFuhrman,"recording the first   college football  preview (big ten and pac12) today means the end of the off season around these parts.

TheCousinSal,this week the degenerate trifecta  i break down best bets for the top 3 nfl games elis hall of fake resume + nfl/landscaping  great  on the denver/chicago bad beat. #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,sadly i get this same question from strangers about a dozen times a day. watch season two of  beginning this monday at 4:30 pm et to find out the answer.
TheCousinSal,gambling on golf always seems to end with a shirtless  counting his winnings in a sand trap. thanks to our pals at  for allowing us to contaminate their beautiful facility.
TheCousinSal,with philly rivers now out of the picture tune in to  this monday to find out  73rd mvp pick of the season. i have a good feeling about this one.
TheCousinSal,ill listen back but i couldve sworn you were pushing me to bet on georgia kicker rodrigo blankenship. either way - look for an applebees gift card in the mail.
TheCousinSal,we have reached a point in time where every 30 minutes for the unforeseeable future we will read a new blurb thats going to absolutely floor us. stay safe people.
12Xpert,sorry i've been  holding out for the two games tonight. i was going to say earlier but i forgot. i should get the data uploaded by 20:00 tonight (uk time).
12Xpert,i have a far more effective tool for setting limits: my woc method. follow it without efforts to disguise your activity and you will have all your bookmaker accounts closed.
12Xpert,it is  a fairly well known bias. some stuff about it in my last book (ssss). basically  it is  regression to the mean. here's a summary published by the bbc.
12Xpert,so there is the opportunity to twist things this way and that to suit the argument without actually presenting the actual data that we need to talk about this properly.
12Xpert,but if youre ruined along the way perseverance doesnt come into to it.  the trouble society doesnt get to see those who did the same as him and were ruined.
12Xpert,mugs. lots of them despite the gambling commission's best efforts (and mine). their existence in large numbers is precisely why betfair went down the sportsbook route in thee first place.
12Xpert,thanks for letting me know. i must have forgotten to run my team name macro. ill make sure this is done when i uoload the results most likely wednesday evening.
12Xpert,"found not to have implied knowledge can be applied to sports betting to ensure success. well you couldn't make this up could you. 
skybet 'winners' already knew this didn't they."
12Xpert,only  not the bookmakers that offer the prices available to make this system happen. of course they tend to get a bit upset if you try to exploit them systematically.
12Xpert,"would you able able post a screenshot of the  's written response to you. interested to see how advertising ""savvy"" is considered acceptable when betting ""savvy"" gets your account closed."
12Xpert,good for them that doesn't surprise me. for matters unrelated to account restrictions i have always found them to be the model bookmaker something i can't extend to many others.
12Xpert,"at a sharp book i think the figure will be 1 percent  or even 1 percent . 
i've set out my arguments about this in detail in my last book."
JambosPicks,"todays the day! our 17-week package covering the entire nfl season mlb  college football  and  college basketball  kicks off today!

mschwimer,if we lose 450 consecutive bets then you are correct. although the likely hood of that is small. especially considering we are +4.06 units in our 6 play career! haha
mschwimer,not advertising any record. we post all our plays so everyone can make their own decision. you can take away those plays if you want. others like to include them.
mschwimer,we dont make bets. and i can promise you. it is not the player in my talking. the modelers have found things i really wish i knew as a player.
mschwimer,haha no!  jambos is an acronym for 6 of our analysts. they do all the hard work in modeling so least i could do was name the company after them.
RufusPeabody,where you went to college is overvalued by the job market. should how much you cared about academics as a 14-17 year old really matter that much decades later?
RufusPeabody,on 3rd and 10 this is a batter outcome for the dolphins than a punt. dont know why more teams dont take these kinds of shots on third down.
RufusPeabody,you're offering bets based on the best lines available but grading using rules available at two books in the world as far as i know. how is that ok?
RufusPeabody,koepka not being motivated by golf and only really trying in majors is something that doesnt have a lot of historical precedent. meaning its not captured in my model
RufusPeabody,to be fair it isnt just  big parlay wins are crack for sport betting media in general. rovell just happens to be at the forefront of this unfortunate coverage
RufusPeabody,there are exceptions but i generally lock in a bet as early as you can once limits are decent enough as markets generally move towards the more efficient number.
RufusPeabody,i hope to god schwimer gets a deal setting odds for a book and has full faith in his numbers which are 8 points off market for nfl games.
RufusPeabody,i heard from bookmaker who said schwimer is one of their most valued clients. and sent me a screenshot of his pl. they will take huge bets from him.
jeffma,not being a ucf apologist but i havent heard any of the mainstream media mention that they were missing their starting qb. probably makes a difference in that game

capjack2000,i set a new year's resolution i intend to keep this year...make sportsbetting better for all involved. here's a list of resolutions from others in and around the industry:
capjack2000,"the  super pool is over. not all the prizes have been awarded though.  let us  hand out some special awards based on the final complete standings found here: 


thread:"
capjack2000,i  daily fantasy sports  think or know. i was just saying that granularity often highlights weaknesses when compared to other operators. no opinion on the profitability of in-game wagering.
capjack2000,there's an irony in naming your show all-access fantasy football and then broadcasting live from a place where nobody can access any of the major  daily fantasy sports  sites.
capjack2000,actually the consensus spread has been 7.5 largely all week. additionally 8  9 are pretty dead numbers. so a move from 9 to 7.5 is not a significant move.
capjack2000,"be the man  make at least a 4-figure bet!

we  daily fantasy sports  want to see $5 on the vikings to win sb. 

show them how  it is  done."
capjack2000,"nj bettors: nba season wins are up at just about every book. plenty of different opinions in the lines and all but one shop is dealing -110 lines.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (vig)"
capjack2000,if theres no such thing as bad publicity then its worth a lot. remember barstool used fanduel as their sportsbook sponsor. im sure pointsbet paid heavily for this privilege.
capjack2000,"what is the value of sharp money to a sportsbook operator? i attempt to explain the concept in this article for . 

includes some good quotes from  as well."
capjack2000,predicting what the future will look like is a foolish endeavor. i feel like youre trying to bait me rather than attempt to see the validity of my viewpoint.

dinkinc,i think  it is  pretty much been told... those pictures will hurt rescue donations and not help them..the opposite of pictures of rescue horses thriving at a second career..
dinkinc,it is still possible.  i think a heel champion is always the best option.  i can see io turning heel if she gets the title and turns on candice
dinkinc,others have that same opinion too rita .... i  daily fantasy sports  really see it as i have never seen a horse dq'ed from directly behind the fouled horse
robpizzola,imagine being a team that has no hope of making the playoffs and running the ball on 1st  25 when your team is down 13-0 in the first quarter.
robpizzola,honestly i check the write-ups every single day and just pray i'm not on the same side as this mush. i really wish i was joking but i'm not.
robpizzola,the roughing the passer penalties are a joke for the most part. defenders cant avoid them half the time. that doesnt change the fact that it was a penalty.
robpizzola,not really sure where you were at all day but i got down early this morning and there was heavy police presence in every spot that i ended up.
robpizzola,that goal could not be reviewed because couture was called for a penalty on the ice. we dont know what that call would have been had it been reviewed.
robpizzola,"columbus in 4 was set at +4651 an implied probability of 2.10 percent .
ny islanders in 4 was set at +1808 an implied probability of 5.24 percent ."
robpizzola,wouldn't really be able to break anything down. the reality is that i run a bunch of numbers through a simulator for march madness and call it a day.
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  get to give free picks often due to line moves after release but dr bob and others have made this one possible:  #140 fla intl -13.5
VegasRefund,even though they probably wont be posted a for a week+.. i find myself checking multiple times a day to see if nfl draft props have been posted yet.
ProfessorShine,many eagles fans simply parrot what they hear on local radio.  fact is pederson still makes correct decisions  his roster from top to bottom play incredibly hard for him.
ProfessorShine,i spent time on his website a few years ago and tracked his games.  ive heard his yearbook is full of data. so good for his fans i guess
ProfessorShine,not yet anyway.  i agree with  partly that people have to be dilligent.  yet consumer protection laws exist.  maybe  can weigh in assuming he knows about the tout environment
ProfessorShine,duke is such a gritty bunch of nba future stars.  will be a tough challenge for coach k to keep focus as a -100000 fav his first few games.
suuma810,their offensive pace was 2nd last but they couldnt stay on the field because their offense wasnt efficient. therefore their d was on the field the 3rd most time.
suuma810,i've found no correlation between pace of play and offensive scoring on the season-level. would love to talk about that and/or see new evidence that i haven't found yet!
suuma810,klar keine frage. aber er ist ein limitierter qb und nach sieben jahren sehe ich da nicht das groe potenzial nach oben. es muss fr ihn halt alles stimmen.
suuma810,sure do salaries rise his contract is still massive. his average salary ranks 3rd behind rodgers and ryan his cap hit will be 3rd in 2019 as of now.
suuma810,"what would be the total in a potential #chiefs / #rams super bowl right now? 60?

the 2016 #packers / #falcons playoff game closed at 60.5 and went over."
ClevTA,should just be able to click the link and if it goes to the web page just reserve your spot and fill in your lineup on the app later
ClevTA,depodesta advocated for stefanski last year so thats one. matt rhule might be a top candidate in a lot of places as well. eberflus and mcdaniels are as well
ClevTA,michigan had success in the air for one half. patterson is 4-22 in the 2nd half. michigan has one  touchdown . that doesnt count only the first half counts?
ClevTA,anyone see an osu/michigan look ahead line? i have models that would put it somewhere in the osu -17 to -20 range. sounds outrageous but its at that point
ClevTA,u are being stubborn for no reason. u are wrong. u dont go for a 4th and 2 from your own 35 with 6m left up 11. thats absurd
ClevTA,well that solves it then. huge sample size there. sea is 5th best in the nfl in 2m drill success on offense. it was an indefensible decision just stop
ClevTA,ha ok. it was literally just something to watch on a friday. if im madly in love with a game u will know it on twitter before a gm
ClevTA,got asked for a couple week 1 survivor pool options. for maybe the first time ever the browns are a top option in a week. 2019 here we go!
ClevTA,all wins are not created tho so most importantly what if the indians win say 75 percent  of their gms vs twins what would they need to break even
CizzlingSports,no this is an atrocious lineup   but if you are serious about being as awful as possible at least add # worst of all time   to round it out
CizzlingSports,she works for and promotes wagertalk. the more picks wagertalk sells the better she does. the fact she doesnt individually sell picks anymore is a distinction without a difference.
CizzlingSports,"lol every time this delusional low-iq gets smoked he claims ""well the public [must have] won"" as if he's just so shrap and contrarian

# worst of all time"
spanky,"thats where the art form comes into play and takes years to master.  

as a beginner i would simply compare prop lines across several outs and pick off numbers."
spanky,appreciate the debate.  i operate on a rather large scale and believe i am a highly sophisticated bettor.  would be interested in seeing case law that contradicts my stance.
spanky,i was fooled once driving by downtown in costa rica. i said damn that girl got a beautiful ass. she/he turned around and ive never been the same since
spanky,there is where well agree to disagree.  assuming all those numbers were real. i dont know any tout who can sell 500k worth of picks on the super bowl
spanky,lots of stuff dated since it came out in 1996. but the underlying principles of the blindfold method is a fundamental tool we use daily. glad you liked it
spanky,this is the sad truth of the industry. a $500 bet causes tremors.... the overnight circled line is the enemy of the professional and best friend of the bookmaker...
spanky,unfortunately standard practice.  many bookmakers both domestic and offshore use confirmation delays as a way to use sharp money to adjust their lines without even writing a bet... #beabookmakernotadressmaker
spanky,i have this exact relationship with sportsbooks worldwide... the big shops know whenever they need a pop (and of course if the price is right) they call the spankster
spanky,daily fantasy sports  sell yourself short.  i've been in this racket long enough to realize you know your sh*t.  i'll be in town next week.  hope to say hi.
spanky,lead detective on my case did a radio interview on npr. not once did he mention me booking anyone....why? because i am not a bookmaker. heres the radio interview:
DocBettor,i kept waiting for the lebron-ad pnr that never came. seemed like they tried to get into it a couple times late but the clippers blew it up cc
PlusEVAnalytics,if this is done out of a misguided sense of i got this leadership its bad. if its a matter of i gotta get mine selfishness its really bad.
PlusEVAnalytics,agreed. kelly  percent  is just the vehicle that i used to present the bayesian posterior for the market regression parameter. there are other presentations that would work equally well.
PlusEVAnalytics,congratulations to  on getting his paper on developing a solvency framework for bookmakers published in this months issue of the actuarial research journal variance. one small step for man...
PlusEVAnalytics,i cant imagine any casual bettor being interested in a weird pts*reb*ast spread bet unless they take the under and theyre going to the game and theyre jeff gillooly
PlusEVAnalytics,per this chain of logic it would be sacrilegious to punish a woman for having an abortion because god made her do it and youd be disrespecting gods will?
PlusEVAnalytics,is it just me or has the markets respect for josh allen and the bills done a complete reversal between midseason and now? 2.5 for this game seems looowwww...
aluckyaday,if you are feeling flush and want to check your draw theory on more data  personally i do think draws get overlooked and inefficiencies could last a long time!
aluckyaday,the only reason you run in to that demise is because they can ban winners. if they could not ban winners prices offers and promotions would be very different.
aluckyaday,i've heard it said that the uk gambling commission is a facilitator not a regulator. maybe like the rest of the us industry they are just following europe's lead
aluckyaday,what makes you think cap st. vincent should be pronounced with a french accent? i believe it is in portugal. or is the horse named after a different place?
aluckyaday,yeah but their smaller packages come with guarantees as well. it would be quite an interesting thing to model. lots of actuarial assumptions would have to be made though!
aluckyaday,ok. you should be ok then. if they are blocking 2*higuita but not different riders then it looks like they have decided that 2 different riders are not related.
aluckyaday,it would be interesting to know what percentage of negative expected value punters use comparison sites. everyone i know personally who bets does. are there any surveys/estimates out there?
aluckyaday,"i hate that term. in sports betting ""the market"" does not exist. to be profitable you need to beat ""a market""  preferably a market that will let you play!"
aluckyaday,you have to remember it is not that long ago that first show meant first show on horses. prices did not exist before on course bookmakers priced them up.
aluckyaday,model was trained on data from 2013-2016  cross validated on data from 2017 tested on data from 2018. not your normal sports metrics data model though something completely different
aluckyaday,2.8 percent  of americans die from a drugs overdose. really? that is one in 35 people! if that is true i would have thought that would be big news!
theFirmAISports,i watch wayyy too many pac-12 games with him calling it... haha half the time hes off on some symbolic soliloquy of saguaros statuesque strength standing on sunburnt sand
joeytunes2,they gave me my own counting room. then threw me out. 5 of us went down with computers. everyone in there was amazed. then through us out. good times
joeytunes2,nope. i didnt know if it was just me. the counter will take a dime or 2   that is  it.  i mean its at least a diff line set.
joeytunes2,"also might take lsu. if 7. these sec teams too much.  but hate favs late.

not sure if i gave out iowa plus 7 but also will be endulging"
joeyisaks,with chiefs and niners both winning and covering 87.6 percent  of pph bookiesn went bankrupt take screenshots cause decent chance you wake up to the call customer service screen
joeyisaks,book 2 for 2020 billion dollar whale is done i give it an a- .. also dont think itll be a good movie what should joey read next?  #readwithjoey
joeyisaks,if u looked at his arm in the review its not on the footbal when wrapped around his body and both hands were on football when he got ball
joeyisaks,anyone volunteer with hi usa ? im volunteering starting next week as long as i pass an interview / curious if anyone else volunteered here and enjoyed doing it?
joeyisaks,big win? come on d.... he risked 2.3k to win 3.2k on a negative expected value bet ... how much did this sportsbook pay you to tweet this dareen?
EdMillerPoker,"googled it and first result

according to the national institute of mental health (nimh) adhd affects 8.1 percent  of the adult population and 29 percent  of the entrepreneurial population."
EdMillerPoker,"people misunderstand the difference between lifespan and healthspan.

lifespan means living long enough to see everyone you care about die.

healthspan means remaining fit enough to dig their graves."
EdMillerPoker,there are exceptions obv esp for large public companies but most businesses fail for the most part you can't really bet against them and  it is  also kinda mean
EdMillerPoker,"producing a engaging firehose of content about gambling is v hard and im rarely critical of the folks who try.

but this article really rubbed me the wrong way."
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i think this is a good sometimes promo but probably not the best as a cornerstone of a business model just my opinion obv
EdMillerPoker,yeah this is a big problem imo with the current live products. the reason they take it down is because they can't make the lines in the 4th quarter
EdMillerPoker,the mistakes are very large in size at the moment and you can catch them just thru comparison. agree that the modeling is tricky esp for football and baseball.
EdMillerPoker,as i said the other day college football in-play is the wild west. if you like finding positive expected value this is a great place to look for it.
EdMillerPoker,not an absolute rule but  daily fantasy sports  kid yourself about red flag ppl. chance of major headaches from that person in both failure and success is super high.
EdMillerPoker,it is  sad man. one of our dogs died sunday morning of a brain tumor. been missing the sound of his nails clicking around on the floor since :(
GolcondaFund,missed this! but was on both...sadly this season's continued fade of balt is looking dumber by the minute. too well coached players too bought in to fade so vehemently.
GolcondaFund,actually would be most successful assigning a digit to each player rather than a name. #37853 retired. ah and #37584 replaces him. moderate downgrade market overreacts buy buy buy.
GolcondaFund,"news broke of tunsil trade and jumped on ravens -6 +100 and moneyline play 1.67 percent  tw 1.67 percent  against worst o-line in football.

line now -7
 

multi-sport fund"
nonrandomalpha,consistent with this ethos would you agree that even blatant and unapologetic tout businesses (eg   etc.) can serve as good sources of free market intelligence to serious sports bettors?
LeeSharpeNFL,"""thank goodness nagy is going for it. a lot of coaches would have punted here and you love to see---

oh a checkdown.  that is  actually worse than punting."""
LeeSharpeNFL,"but seriously i did once go with tabak to a packers backers thing. they're a fun group. sports fandom is great.

just you know better in orange and blue."
LeeSharpeNFL,i am off work until january 2! and since i  daily fantasy sports  really watch/follow college football this leaves me plenty of time to dig into nfl numbers. :)
LeeSharpeNFL,i think the cowboys should have been given a defer from the beginning but changing it at halftime is very awkward (but probably ultimately the right thing to do).
LeeSharpeNFL,"lose/lose trade!

not really it was great for the raiders. the decision to use the earlier of the first round picks on a running back was pretty yikes though."
LeeSharpeNFL,nagy was too busy complaining to the official about the missed face mark call to call a real play on 3rd down that might actually get a 1st down.
LeeSharpeNFL,i would look at just sunday night games those do tend to be more marquee matchups but not always. chi/lar for example didn't flex out because of market size.
whale_capper,of course if they could go back in time and get 2015 cam you play him over allen in a heartbeat but i fear that player is long gone
whale_capper,thanks man thought of a bunch of other stuff i wish we had covered of course but it did start an good discussion in the community about the issue
whale_capper,also hoping por makes adjustments to take away the orebs and we know neither team likes to run sprinkle a little fatigue and elevation and  it is  a beauty
AndyMSFW,"while we're all destroying the terrible seattle opener...  college basketball  recap:
fri: 0-1
sat: 2-1
sun: 3-1
keeping my head above water as we slide into the new year."
AndyMSFW,i still  daily fantasy sports  know what happened there.  either that kid from memphis transferred to jackson state today or a couple of portland's players are lost at sea...
AndyMSFW,"week 16 grabs:
giants over 41.5 -110 (bookmaker)

texas -1 -105 (lowvig)
green bay +4 -105 (lowvig)"
AndyMSFW,"*back to shitting on them*
why are the listed in that order??? make it rams in one column cowboys in the other one price list ascending the other descending."
AndyMSFW,this is 1000 percent  a touchdown for philly.  but either way we're just blessed to see one of the two least reasonable fan bases in sports lose their minds.
AndyMSFW,detailed it on the podcast and  it is  in the spreadsheet but for the record i'm on the over 49 tonight.  see ya at halftime.  # thursday night football
AndyMSFW,"too many  plays to fit on one card going to release stuff throughout the day starting with:
outrights presented by jena sims (brooks is under there somewhere as well)"
AndyMSFW,"as we talked about on the tuesday  i've sprankled some small bets on women's world cup futures:
usa +300 (0.6x)
germany +605 (0.4x)
dutch +1400 (0.25x)
aussies +1800 (0.25x)"
AndyMSFW,i'll deal with it today because i'm glad you didn't lose a bunch of money and an out.  gonna need the surly bastard we all love back tomorrow though.
JoeyKnish22,lmao im just messing around steve. gonna listen to it myself tonight mainly so i can use it against cheetah in the bowl pool but glad you enjoyed it.
JoeyKnish22,the hot trub is warming up!!! come take a dip water is nice and tub is full of middle aged white guys with too much money on the bears
JoeyKnish22,if you cant find it after following these directions stop spos betting now. because heres the hard truth. youre too stupid to win. but still have a happy thanksgiving
JoeyKnish22,maybe have  tell steve and jesse what ahlers career against the spread record is. because betting on him frequently is a big reason why im still living in detroit.
JoeyKnish22,you can have all the closing line value free play you want baby the rollover is so large anyway youll be dead before you ever get your money out.
JoeyKnish22,the ball is over the yellow line. not sure you can use that as conclusive cause who the fuck knows in this league. but he obviously got the 1st.
JoeyKnish22,and tell those yosef trolls rolling around appy state can suck my dick theyre bout to get bent over by the cocks this weekend like its a  house pay
TheKostos,"""shallow"" has to be the  karaoke song right now. unreal duet and  it is  easy for both guy and girl to sing and  it is  a dope ass song"
TheKostos,nightmare. if the jets keep scoring lamar is gonna put 50 on the board. unreal. i hate the jets and i hate gregg williams and i hate adam gase
TheKostos,what a dumbass team. imagine not putting him on ir to start the season and wasting a roster spot. imagine still not deactivating him!!! its almost thanksgiving! youre 0-10!
TheKostos,"as we stand on the precipice of a week 11 nfl sunday i nick kostos am wishing you:

minimal sweats

winning bets

and the absolute very best of luck."
TheKostos,"i think aew is awesome. kenny omega is my favorite wrestler.

but this match is stupid!!!  it is  not for me.  it is  beyond unnecessary. not a fan.

#aewfullgear"
TheKostos,"that was his first promo back too. think about how amazing he's gonna be as he gets his feet back under him.

i *need* ""trust me"" to return. need."
TheKostos,"schala theme underrated choice. gets overshadowed by corridors of time but  it is  very very good

(yes i own the ct soundtrack in addition to several other jrpg soundtracks)"
TheKostos,12 years ago today was the best sports moment of my life and theres nothing that could ever be better. giants 17 patriots 14. got goosebumps just typing that
TheKostos,definitely betting at least one nba game tonight and looks like i'll have anywhere from 2-4  college basketball  plays. plus a pick for thiem/zverev in the australian open semis.
TheKostos,i want a game where i'm not covering fo 59 minutes and then cover at the end. give me bullshit. give me bullshit. give me to me you asshole
TheKostos,since im extremely self deprecating when i lose i want to take this time to say ive won three straight weeks in the nfl. thank you for your time
LockyLockerson,really tough because usc has been all over the map for me all year tough for me to make a number on them sometimes but i had oregon -6
LockyLockerson,"that is  not me saying ""jam this side"" or anything just something we  daily fantasy sports  normally expect from opening night/day: already trying to account for multiple key injuries."
LockyLockerson,the really wild thing is im not saying the game is rigged but if you were going to tip the scales thats the absolute ideal way to do it
LockyLockerson,could be that situation for sure but couldnt it just also be wisconsin runs for 500 yards? number pretty close for me so dont really wanna play it sorry
LockyLockerson,dal-was: really popular home 'dog for a lot of people i follow but just nothing here for me.  opened dal -4.5 now dal -5 i made it dal -4.8.
LockyLockerson,ari-bal: may seem like a baltimore overreaction but using pre-season numbers i made this ravens -14.4....so....no overreaction.  ravens have significant injury concerns on both sides so probably passing here.
LockyLockerson,doing the show friday night 6-10 every week of season except for one or two... will do show then post picks i discussed on show here and pin them
LockyLockerson,tonight was one of the few jeopardy episodes during the streak where both other contestants were so mad the whole time.  this fucking guy was basically over their heads.

DannyParkins,had him. started him. in an absolute barn burner against a guy who has cmc-sanders-mixon all playing. i also have zeke. a matchup worthy of the playoff semis. #youcare
DannyParkins,right. because they dont have the personnel to do a traditional running game. kc runs to their receivers all the time. guys not blocking and fumbling is the problem.
DannyParkins,we had been going 24 minutes at that point i got my point in that it was different and we were late to break. i wasnt changing his mind.
DannyParkins,that was a fun game on a tough road trip with a chance to feel good coming home tomorrow. huge effort from darvish with rizzo  strop offering supporting roles.
DannyParkins,agreed. just think tonight is gonna be an adventure. hes in short sleeves so doesnt seem outwardly bothered by the cold and threw a ton of strikes. well see.
DannyParkins,one of the best pieces of sportswriting i've ever read is wright thompson on ichiro. carve out some time today if you want a greater understanding of the legend.
chadmillman,join my pickem pool in the action network app. im picking all 16 week 2 nfl games against the spread winner comes on  to rub it in my face.

chadmillman,another from  on how he ended up winning ridiculous money on a triple crown race while on a rehab assignment from the dodgers. this time  it is  the belmont.
chadmillman,new rules: pats are two touchdown faves and cover by whatever they choose. another new rule: ignoring a potential jinx by tweeting about a cover before game is over.
chadmillman,sean lee zeke elliott jerry distractions (thanks to  and  ). but mostly public thinking eagles are invincible (extra credit for anyone who picks up on what i did there).
Gingfacekillah,picked up the corsair h150i pro so far so good! having a few issues trying to run all 4 sticks of ram though will hopefully get that sorted soon.
Gingfacekillah,this error simply means the ranges aren't the same length. check to make sure you have included the labels in both ranges and that they are the same length.
Gingfacekillah,i noticed that too. by these numbers they would be projected to cover +17.5 at home vs ne. will have to wait and see gather a bit more data.
Gingfacekillah,recalculated with lebron at 32 minutes which is his theoretical minute restriction ceiling. it doesn't get much better for the lakers but does push the total up a bit:
Gingfacekillah,min/det tonight. i think under and minutes looks good. even if you knock a bit off their og for fatigue still likely to be much more competitive than +5.
Gingfacekillah,my understanding isnt that strong but i thought that was the whole point of data partitioning with a train and test set: to avoid overfitting and data mining error.
Gingfacekillah,thanks for this. i've been through benter's paper and used logistic regression successfully to the end you've described. just exploring how something similar might be done with bayes theorem.
logan_matthews9,have you tracked your clv? i feel like i get good value most times. yesterday i got brewers at -150 and at one point saw the reds at +155
logan_matthews9,the gold cup odds seem... off to me. you can get mexico +140 and the us +150... no one other than those two have won a traditional gold cup.
PikachuBets,thanks for replying and clarifying. no hard feelings. still incredibly difficult to believe someone is willing book 10k overnight sides. you must be down huge lifetime with your guy
PikachuBets,"point is that you're that meathead idiot who flexes ""wins"" with checkmark emojis on twitter before the games are over all while responding to your shitty employer's tweet lol"
PikachuBets,clearly you  daily fantasy sports  even know what the screen limits are for that market let alone the scale you could get off screen. so just stop and stfu
PikachuBets,actually you might never get to use another offshore book again depending on how quickly they add your name to the blacklist that circulates among the major offshore books
PikachuBets,dude calm your fucking tits are you new to gambling twitter or something...ribbing ppl while sweating games or waiting for next dart is how it goes around here. jeez.

adamchernoff,yep. it was a similar situation last year. but this is going on 13 weeks now again this year and trending worse the last 4 5 and 6 weeks.
adamchernoff,not equipped for whole hog but thats certainly on my list. not many more for me personally with ribs. just experimenting new flavours and types each week for fun.

this sunday i have two bets locked in to continue a great start to the season. 

read:"
adamchernoff,very true. just not something i have had the time to get around to this season. have you done any tinkering with the 0.2 and seen any other results?
Ccon8181,needed that one glad it came through. #rams -6.. and to those that moved the line against me. hope they learned theyre lesson haha jk .. onto the next
Ccon8181,for the horse betting community. give me your best shot at #delmar today. not shy to admit i dont do the horses but let me know who you got.
Ccon8181,#purdue done... gonna take a dive to get #gophers in the tournament. thought about that angle but didnt think purdue would comply. edwards doesnt even want to be there.
Ccon8181,do you know what limits they have on the app? i gotta check regardless need the outs but just curious if you know off the top of your head.
Ccon8181,if blount would have scored on that last run and the #jets fell outside +9 after being up 1 with 4 minutes left i would have lost my mind
Ccon8181,put out all plays for free and the season ends today.  it is  been a great #nba season.  daily fantasy sports  charge just ask for retweets not likes retweets.
Ccon8181,tonight marks the end of the # college basketball  season. will end up being my worst on record currently 4 games under .500 far to many plays this year.
kellyinvegas,one of my favs each week. which way are the lines moving? we talk a lot about getting the best of the number. this is always a helpful tool.
kellyinvegas,i made niners 7. lots of hype with seattle im not buying. everyone is ready to give russell mvp. best defense hes faced. well see how it pans out.
ToddFuhrman,that is  the issue; we get a day game in the middle of the week  it is  rather bizarre and no doubt a made for tv creation these days
ToddFuhrman,a dominant performance this time of year always forces the hand of a bookmaker to over react; will be interesting to see how perception changes after the next game
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to betting sports as a recreational pursuit be sure to set aside money you can afford to lose; the fun stops when you dont gamble responsibly
ToddFuhrman,"podcast potpourri...for anyone looking to play catch up on their football prep  and i have got you covered at

ToddFuhrman,you (joshua) walking into a sportsbook on a nfl sunday before the book (ruiz jr) hits you in the mouth repeatedly and basically dances on your still warm corpse
ToddFuhrman,it is  stunning to me how quickly and swiftly they acted with hunt (obviously because of video) but letting this linger much longer given his importance to the offense
ToddFuhrman,chris  let us  be honest...the ponies are always at the forefront for you year round my good man;  daily fantasy sports  pull the seasonality card on us here ha
ToddFuhrman,dont be self conscious darren no matter how much we laugh when youre on  has to deal with it daily and finds himself in a class of his own
ToddFuhrman,most books going to wait until a day before if not day of especially early on knowing the majority of bets they'll potentially be taking come from sharper customers
TheCousinSal,"_____ has a terrible lie
______ is in a world of trouble

result:
_____ lays it up 25 feet from the hole 

- every golf announcer all the time"
TheCousinSal,this game is already hard-hitting and terrific. why do i get the feeling that 5 hours from now theyre still going to be going at each others throats? #stanleycupplayoffs
TheCousinSal,sure weve all used a fake penis to pass a drug test before participating in the olympics but  experience with this tactic is pretty special. (interview begins at 1:00:35)
TheCousinSal,the fact that this generation was robbed of chris farleys greatness is a travesty worse than all horrible officiating calls put together. thank you   for bringing it all home.
TheCousinSal,we are witnessing two of the greatest defenses in the history of the national football league (need to keep repeating things like this in order to stay awake).  #nyjvscle
TheCousinSal,i feel horrible for the long-suffering vegas knights fans but happy for the capitals ...and for me for barely cashing my adjusted bet of under 7.5 goals.  #ibelieveinmiracles  #stanleycupfinal
TheCousinSal,nba tanksgiving update: favs were 8-1 against the spread and 9-0 overall tonight. hate to jinx us degenerates but we may have an easy couple days ahead. #notachance #gambling
TheCousinSal,epic against all odds podcast. best nfl/college bets and prop talk with my degenerate trifecta - then super dave osborne (curb's marty funkhauser) berates me and  for an hour.
12Xpert,i am just  daily fantasy sports  have the data nor motivation to get properly into using them. besides there are better people than me doing great things with them.
12Xpert,brilliant. destroy a billion pound industry that supports 85000 jobs because you have a moral objection to gambling at least you've finally been honest about your view of it.
12Xpert,"rufus on what's wrong with the tipster model. quite a lot actually.

 daily fantasy sports  ever assume ""guaranteed"" means guaranteed in the betting industry.  that is  my $0.02's worth."
12Xpert,"those new to this can find the method behind my approach here: 
beware you will run the risk of killing your betting accounts if you use it with disguise."
12Xpert,"main leagues weekend fixtures available a day early since i probably won't have time to do them friday.

wocs available too.
extra league will be available later tonight (hopefully)"
12Xpert,but if they do they should prove they that they have something worth buying. my inability to offer something really worth buying has absolutely nothing to do with that.
12Xpert,that is  typically not something i offer. those sorts of things can be created by users from the raw data. i've always just been about offering the raw data.
12Xpert,as a skeptic i would say that if you still have any recreational bookmaker accounts left at all after betting regularly they clearly  daily fantasy sports  agree with you.
12Xpert,brilliant. lake wobegon effect in full effect.. well over 50 percent  of the sample believe they are at least average or above average in that sample. a logical impossibility.
12Xpert,they might have won it if financial fair play was a real thing rather than just an acronym used by sports journalists. perhaps also if committing doping violations mattered.
12Xpert,but compared relatively to closing odds using the method here the are clearly not as good as closing and opening to closing is a goo predictive tool for roi
12Xpert,so again implied 538 odds divided by implied true odds estimated from pinnacle opening odds is a decent measure of expected roi (on average). sample size is 49905 odds.
12Xpert,my thoughts are that regulation/prohibition is rarely effective. education is always better. and that can start with explaining that gambling isn't a moral bad  it is  part of life.
JambosPicks,paul goldschmidt launches a two-run  hour and the #cardinals lead the #reds 2-1 in the 3rd! can they hang on to get jambos subscribers (f5) and moneyline winners? #gamblingtwitter
mschwimer,thursday podcast!  game of the week is tonight! tune in for some insights!  7 props as well.  4-4-1 in game of the week this year and 31-26 +3.08 units.
mschwimer,let me get this straight.  are you saying if we had a professional conversation about this that the smart listeners would agree with my pov and disagree with yours?
mschwimer,not true. he said point blank that he didnt believe our plays will win over the long haul and no one could make the financial guarantee we are making.
mschwimer,scroll to the bottom. below the video. menu only works for people who register. you should register anyways. its 100 percent  free and you can see our history etc.
mschwimer,it is most certainly not! our general counsel is ex gc of mgm. we have our bases covered. we are not taking any bets. simply giving out pick recs.
RufusPeabody,i would be inclined to say he has more skill than someone who only bet a million in a year yes. a lot less likely he was lucky.
RufusPeabody,you bet a team -3 -105 (w/ -115 comeback) at a market-making book. that game closes -3 -110/-110 at the same book. would you consider this positive clv?
RufusPeabody,so if youre doing your own handicapping why bother with a trend? if the market isnt properly valuing something you should see the value just using your model
RufusPeabody,were not doing the washington post  college football  playoff column this year. i think four people read it and it took a significant amount of time every week.
RufusPeabody,sorry that was unclear. as long as your edges aren't biased  meaning the prediction errors are centered around 0 it doesn't matter that your edge is an estimate.
RufusPeabody,true. but  says his subscribers want to know where the best number is. easy solution: grade against widely available number but point out who has the best number.
RufusPeabody,. hands a backpack full of $150000 in cash to a reporter. what could possibly go wrong?  fantastic article by  shedding light on the new sports betting landscape.
RufusPeabody,so you want people to believe with zero evidence provided that sharps and books are buying picks that are -4.44 units over 2161 plays since you started selling?
jeffma,not an ignorant question at all. just based on numbers. its probably one of the hardest things to figure out in sports analytics. how to weigh recent performance
jeffma,also i think the formatting issues have come in since he cut an pasted into whatever text editor he is currently using so not a product of youth
jeffma,hey chris would love to give you the platform to discuss your process... curious how you came to this teaser? and what vig did you have to pay?
jeffma,also enjoyed it. but im not one of those americans that think vegas matters. i still think some of the soccer numbers for known winning bettors is astronomical
jeffma,i  daily fantasy sports  care about the miami trip. but i will contend playing 4 quarters last week like it was the super bowl was a bad idea
jeffma,as a pats fan that was present for the 18-1 super bowl. i can tell you these losses are a good thing for the w's and their fans
SportsCheetah,i dont remember the last time i read up on a movie after i finished watching it but it comes at night has me digging around right now.
SportsCheetah,as good of a start as it has been id be surprised if they made a legitimate playoff push. out by deadline though is probably a coin flip.
SportsCheetah,haha yeah wvu was at 1 yard per play at half they couldnt move it at all otherwise. i was fine getting out of that at the time.
SportsCheetah,well so far they havent let him shoot midrange jumpers and he scored 16 in the 4q in the comeback over miami so maybe hes not as bad.
capjack2000,"looks like  has 23 props on tonights monday night football  game!

unfortunately when you go into props here in nj there is only one for first  touchdown  scorer."
capjack2000,yep fully admit i botched that part of the tweet. in my defense that entire tweet thread was done while lying in bed with only one eye open.
capjack2000,nvs sept handle might beat njs by 9-figures. looking back it should have been obvious when neither rebuck or christie tipped their hand at g2e wrt the numbers.
capjack2000,i think we all played action points back in the day. although my local never offered action points on the slugging percentage of a team in a game.
capjack2000,i have not looked at foxbet's pa offering but the fanduel promo is available in both nj  pa.  i assume foxbet has the same lines in both states.
capjack2000,really guys my golf game is pretty bad unless there are windmills involved. besides i suspect mr. peabody is hard at work in the laboratory until late january.
capjack2000,"looks like  it is  just via the app for now. i'd guess they'll modify the web version too.

ok my shift on the dk help desk is up."
capjack2000,wh does over-the-counter retail better than anyone else in nj and its not close. thats more a testament to how they train their employees than any bookmaking philosophy.
capjack2000,this was a great episode. a close second to teds appearance last year. that he can be that thorough and well-spoken all while being a barista is extraordinary.
capjack2000,no  that is  not it. here's a comparison of their online tax numbers from last month where location doesn't matter. fd did twice the online revenue as dk.
capjack2000,they also realize that most states will criminalize taking affiliate money from offshore in the future. this is the perfect opportunity to switch allegiances in an orwellian way.
capjack2000,innovative! much more relevant for vsin to run a betting tournament rather than the tired old ncaa bracket competition or just a simple pick'em. looking forward to this.
dinkinc,i dont want to brag but the only bet i made on the late game was taking 1000-1 on over 1 1/2 balls getting stuck in the fence
dinkinc,if there is one thing i agree with  is he should not be impeached...i worry enough about the gun violence that will occur when he gets voted out...
dinkinc,i think i have a valid opinion on how to lose money booking good wrestling shows... i wonder why no one asks me how to go about that
dinkinc,no.  some people preach jesus as the answer to our problems. i think we lose our ability to fix problems when we hand them over to some god
dinkinc,the vast  majority of people in the horse racing business love the horses. however the majority of people in horse racing who can change the rules do not.
dinkinc,i enjoy your work.  you have a great look and you get it.  enjoyed your interview you did on busted open. just wanted to say some nice things
dinkinc,the derby thing involved an unwritten rule.  different standards for big races.  i think that ended it.  fortunately no human ir horse had to get hurt or die
dinkinc,heavens forbid we update the judging of a horserace in an effort to improve horse safety..... kinda like they do in hockey and football to protect against concussions
robpizzola,they held the ravens to 20 packers to 8 bucs to 17 and rams to 7. they may have dominated crappy offenders. they also dominated some good ones.
robpizzola,yep the team that committed a billion dollars to a quarterback that needs his coach to read defenses at the line of scrimmage definitely has the brightest future.
robpizzola,i dont think you realize how much that 2.5m means for the leafs and finding a partner to retain salary on a top pairing d-man was absolutely huge.
robpizzola,higher hold will hurt retention rates which *could* theoretically lead to less ggr down the road but that would only happen with a prolonged period of high hold.
robpizzola,i'm referring to the fact that neither of those sites has the full complement of data that they need to even come close to accurately calculating expected goals.
RASPicks,our last free pick (byu side) a few weeks back didn't fair very well will release a free  college football  total right here on twitter at 12:10pm pst.
RASPicks,ct/wash side has moved 194 times since open at pinnacle (range of -2 to -4)  daily fantasy sports  recall seeing so much action on a wnba game before.
VegasRefund,19 degrees in nyc this morning. fully convinced the seasons have pushed where jan/feb is march now.. and well still be getting snow is april and maybe may.
VegasRefund,to put into perspective how bad the peters/siena game was... the total closed at 128 and the under still hit with a twelve point cushion after three overtimes.
ProfessorShine,smart touts like marc lawrence sell different packages so if one goes sideways they can pimp the other one or two.   it is an scam on dumb degens.
ProfessorShine,id like to think a radio person can be interesting without being totally fluff narrative.  but theres a market for marshall apparently.  he has gold sheets to sell
suuma810,and the reason they increased their rushing rate was because they were winning more games than during weeks 1-9  they were a pass heavy team early in games.
suuma810,for what  it is  worth  todd gurley faced 8+ men in the box on only 8 percent  of his runs this season the lowest number in the league.
suuma810,sam darnold lit up the packers but on the most important drive the #jets trusted their run game that produced 2.3 yards per carry. on back-to-back long downs.
suuma810,"doesnt look like aj green will play this week. lt cordy glenn also on the injury report.

browns down to +2.5 +102 at pinny +3 -125 at bookmaker."
suuma810,re joe buck: with the legalization of gambling a lot of misinformed people in the media and on sports platforms will talk about #betting this season. be aware!
ClevTA,this gm only means something to kc if they assume ne loses to miami at home next week right? maybe they lay off the gas? probably not but
ClevTA,no different than if i tired to play poker every day. i can make fun of your terrible nba takes but u would kick my ass heads up!
ClevTA,just saw lukas stat line thru 1q and had to do a double take. i hope gs rallies so he can play most of the gm. crazy stuff
ClevTA,ok i accept your apology. i was wondering why u are literally the only person to disagree then saw u are a ne fan. now it makes sense
ClevTA,i dont do isolated write ups for  sunday night football  or monday night football . never have. only  thursday night football . been doing that since day 1
ClevTA,what kind of response is this? im starting a fact and points to the rest of their schedule not being difficult with actual data. how miserable are u
ClevTA,yes all nfl coaches would rather play the chiefs than the jets right now. plz stop this jason its a ridiculous premise that even u dont actually believe
ClevTA,spending 3  hours at the apple store bc the new ios completely f'd up an iphone is a blast. nfl pks a little delayed. on the way later
CizzlingSports,mike mike and crew did make some changes - apparently deleted all non-cris units from the records. but still holding onto all dem units allegedly own pre-8/27 lol
CizzlingSports,"not sure what this is responding to.

 it is  a problem that you  daily fantasy sports  know how to present/make available basic information and metrics regarding alleged past-performance."
CizzlingSports,at this point there's enough info out there; there's no excuse to fall for it other than stupidity which of course is common to nearly all klay stans
CizzlingSports,lmao my screenshot is direct from the  app from 10 minutes ago care to explain why your carefully cropped one-liner list more wins less losses and more pushes?
CizzlingSports,"there are numerous places in new york law where there term ""person"" is expressly defined to include coporations like action network inc. shock-stun that  content is wrong/useless again."
spanky,the results of at least 1000 non-prop plays - and payment of the guarantee if applicable - will do all the talking on december 31st.  nothing else matters...
spanky,same reason why caesars/harrahs sportsbook supervisor guaranteed my limits would never be cut only to renege and cut me down to peanuts (see below).  the incompetence runs deep.
spanky,cuz twitter world scooped up the cheap copies... i took a pic right after i recommended it....  im in the wrong business.  i gotta write a book lol.
spanky,this is put very elegantly and i love it... for me not going bankrupt is far more important than leaving money on the table.  minimizing risk  maximizing return.
spanky,i'm not your man. i lose more accounts weekly then you probably have ever had in your life.  the anonymity of twitter makes you feel powerful.  keep hatin
spanky,the beautiful thing is there was a vocal platform for everyone to get paid. the sad thing is it required a vocal platform for everyone to get paid.
spanky,when my guys played at  they had a $1000 minimum window which was never enforced.  anyone know if thats still there and if so is it ever enforced?
DocBettor,danny finally gets back in the game halfway through the 2nd quarter and promptly hits his first 3. rest of the lakers are 0 for 11 from downtown.
DocBettor,it was astounding how long it took oddsmakers to adjust nba totals this season (though to be fair it was due to more than just the rule change)
PlusEVAnalytics,yes compare the 17 percent  take to a -110 market. theyre both the magnitude by which you have to be a better than average handicapper to become +ev.
PlusEVAnalytics,while were on the subject been doing some thinking about which movie/tv/entertainment properties would make the worst slot machines. would #1 be schindlers list bambi or brokeback mountain?
PlusEVAnalytics,tell me again why black box models are so great...lol. twitter thinks andy is a dog lover because his followers post about dogs all the time i.e. underdogs.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes thats a huge problem. its one thing to say regress to market but its non-trivial to decide by how much. to be covered in my article :)
PlusEVAnalytics,took a read through  model description - its not bad but can be improved. 1 percent  actual roi on 17 percent  theoretical positive expected value seems about right.
PlusEVAnalytics,sure but the increase maybe crossed the line between build them at your own schedule and aggressively force cashiers to push for the demise of their own jobs
PlusEVAnalytics,youre missing the point. let x be some data element or combination of data elements. i find a predictive relationship between x and over/under. you wont see it.
PlusEVAnalytics,with all the parameter uncertainty around xfl im surprised these lines arent closer to pk. id have to handicap a game at -12 before i bet it -9.
aluckyaday,forgot to update. 1-3. season now 27-22-3 (started week 2)  55.1 percent . infinite tipping monkeys would have this record or better 24.4 percent  of the time. regressing
aluckyaday,yep margin=vig. lower vig to gain market share or to attract the sharps with the best informationi believe pinnacle changed their approach when they left the us market.
aluckyaday,not sure how to do it but things like this have to stop. social media has changed the rules of the game. legislation has to catch up fast.
aluckyaday,1-3. first week below .500  even more mean revision. season now 13-10-1 (started week 2)  now only 56 percent . last seasons test set was 57 percent .
aluckyaday,well time will tell but my bet would be on the softs winning. when you have paris smith saying she can only dream of their kind of numbers.....
theFirmAISports,but i really do like your metric! its tough to truly capture a players impact and this does a great job appreciating the more nuanced aspects + traditional
joeytunes2,i think we might try and gain and edge bye seeing the cleat length or something silly. he might get a partner on the sideline as well. haha
joeytunes2,are we done with winston? this guy sucks. they would win more games not passing. he really is the  fault of all losses. again i bet this moron.
joeytunes2,ask me for more picks guyyyyy. must be hard to watch the game with you living in your parents house. lmk when you wanna compare seats or bankroll.
joeytunes2,hahah no sir. i liked vegas better. when i lived. no argument there guyyyyyy. vegas will never go away. we just grew up on this out here haha
joeytunes2,yes  that is  rare. but sure i'll agree. -110 from luck doesn't win. long. maybe short burst. yes but they know who will give back and who won't.
joeytunes2,hi guyyyyy  any opinions on nfl this week. maybe we can get a small wager going.   let us  say jeff cap for you. and tanning oil for me?
joeyisaks,but in this case its avid bettors who are talking down to someone who covers betting professionally and paid well yet after a year + is still clueless
joeyisaks,now i just know. if u wana buy in 500k + at a table game just negotiate a  percent  of losses back. theyll usually give u 17 percent
joeyisaks,sampras agassi played when they seeded 16.. djok fed get 32 seeds.. much tougher back then.. novak is going to make finals without playing a top 20 player.
joeyisaks,if you ignore the flight passengers  first responders  and other countless innocent lives lost that day and in war after i guess these two events are the same
joeyisaks,impressive to go from a sensical rant to begging for accounts. i wish i had the balls to beg random twitter strangers for accojnts but not there yet
joeyisaks,sharp money was def not on seahawks... not sure if you read that on action network or something but only sharp action was when vikings would hit +3.5
EdMillerPoker,i think low stakes live poker will always be alive and well but the clock started ticking on competitive poker the moment the first online site went live.
EdMillerPoker,periodic reminder that people who build their brand around debunking other peoples bullshit usually use their truth telling credibility to ask you to swallow their own bullshit unskeptically
EdMillerPoker,i understand but i think that wherever regulatory structure permits you will eventually see what youre talking about. what is lacking is not the intention but the means.
EdMillerPoker,are there any standards of speed and accuracy required in the bill for the official in-play data? or are sportsbooks required to buy it no matter the quality?
EdMillerPoker,just ran an audit on my twitter acct and it says all my followers are bots will be tweeting in machine code from now on for better engagement
EdMillerPoker,hey look someone produced a video saying that if you tip servers less you'll save money this is a fascinating concept  let us  stop working and discuss this
EdMillerPoker,obv im not. but spend 9 figures on branding and it gets you market share out of the gate esp when you're ready to launch first as well
EdMillerPoker,"there's no such thing as a poker player whose communicated thoughts and ideas (as opposed to what they understand internally) can be taken as ""authoritative"" on the topic"
GolcondaFund,"social peer pressure even from ""elites"" works better than silence.

see every social issue known to man.

in general you are correct but the alternative is less productive."
GolcondaFund,"to be fair if this was someone ugly or...you know prob would be more pc police outrage for calling her ""baby."" 

interesting how different rules for different folks..."
GolcondaFund,"say what you want but after 6 weeks the nfc east is up for grabs. 

giants can go 3-1 their next 4 games and be tied for first."
GolcondaFund,"jackson...one trick pony
agholor......one year wonder
alshon injury prone...
previous results is not predictive of future success. 
loving the eagles hype this year though. good time to sell."
nonrandomalpha,this is a big whiff by   - tepper got rid of riveria early since it was a forgone conclusion so might as well not unnecessarily drag it out.
nonrandomalpha,pretty sure everyone every week has the bears crushing their opponent and the bears scoring like 4  touchdown s...is everyone such a homer that they cant see straight?
LeeSharpeNFL,gb is a slightly above average team per massey-peabody and they have a bye.  very fortunate for them and we should not expect their good fortune to continue.
LeeSharpeNFL,why?  it is  kind of insane if you were going to keep him before the pick but after it want to let him go.  it is  one play.
LeeSharpeNFL,after experiencing like 36 hours of consecutive rain in seattle i am extremely jealous that you are somewhere where touching a bottle of sunscreen is a reasonable decision.
LeeSharpeNFL,"or arians (as happened earlier today).

the ""i'm upset by this call and convinced i am right therefore i throw the flag without considering any other factors."" challenge."
LeeSharpeNFL,"you're correct. while i think generally it is a fairly good model i do think  it is  unstable around the end game scenarios.

i've deleted the commentary tweet."
LeeSharpeNFL,"probably yes but you should both expect and receive a backlash when you derisively refer to statistical analysis as ""football being played on spreadsheets instead of a field""."
LeeSharpeNFL,oh to be clear it was still running code before i just had to fire it off manually. now i  daily fantasy sports  have to do even that.
LeeSharpeNFL,mia offers him two first round picks and he says no even though his desired pick will still be there with the 4th overall pick he'll now have.
LeeSharpeNFL,would be incredible if dal/phi no longer matters and the nfl was willing to let that got flexed to  sunday night football  but i doubt either is true.
LeeSharpeNFL,this seems like the perfect opportunity for a fun twitter bet. set an over/under on rodgers' epa/play by end of season. loser donates to charity of winner's choice?
LeeSharpeNFL,"broke: the bears offense is doing fine  it is  not their fault the kicker is missing field goals.

woke: if they're not getting touchdowns they're not doing fine."
LeeSharpeNFL,also the differential is likely higher on  thursday night football  games. data has shown the better team wins a higher  percent  of the time off the short week.
LeeSharpeNFL,lot of respect for baker mayfield for immediately bring willing to call out his teammate's behavior. far too many would have ducked the question or worse defended him.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it would be ""funny"" if there were more coaches assigned to stopping their bosses from making bad decisions in this area than to studying actually making good ones."
whale_capper,yes time decay refers to the weighting of the last x games so more recent games are more highly weighted... quadrants are the same as the nba one
whale_capper,have been hoping a more substantial leak would materialize today to send the number soaring and i could cover my exposure but that looks unlikely at this point
AndyMSFW,i get itchy about placing non-wong teasers but you're right.   it is  a way better option if  that is  the way you want to attack those two games.
AndyMSFW,yeah not sure if it ticks down further but this is where i plant my flag.  be interesting to see what this number does in a few hours.
AndyMSFW,lightly mentioned this on the podcast but wasn't 100 percent  sure what the bucs science team all had in place for the trip to london.  nice find demetrios.
AndyMSFW,it wasn't an easy decision nor one i took lightly.  httr bear down chicago bears and the weird dolphins theme with all the banjo all earn honorable mentions.
AndyMSFW,he's a good putter i guess i'm banking on it not regressing too much while the other pieces of his game catch up a bit over the weekend.
AndyMSFW,"round 4  
mccarthy -0.5  saunders +104 (bm)
piercy  howell iii -111 (bm)
harman -0.5  danielson -129 (5d)
tringale -0.5  burgoon +101 (5d)
niemann -0.5  frittelli -114 (5d)
#sundaybrunch"
JoeyKnish22,no i totally see what youre seeing. allen is a more fiery guy and seems to understand the game better. trubisky quite passive and just seems lacking mentally.
JoeyKnish22,where did they go? . my gifts have been stolen from under the tree. maybe they heard andy singing terrible christmas songs and decided to pull them down.
JoeyKnish22,darren how long are you staying at lindes house for? thought maybe the 3 of us mattress mack and the parlay kid might grab some sushi this week?
JoeyKnish22,"account has to be clean (not limited) and verified (all verification info submitted for withdrawals). 

as many know they havent taken new accounts for years (hence the request)."
JoeyKnish22,hadnt checked his stats in a few weeks but the season long breida rushing yards prop hit tonight . now lets get him a couple more  touchdown s.
JoeyKnish22,lmao im pretty surprised too. i might try like a 1.1 or that smart speed to remove long pauses but i never see myself as a 1.5-2x guy.
JoeyKnish22,agreed its a horrible set up for him. 3 man booth is too much and hes with 2 traditional broadcast guys. its just an awkward fit not working.
JoeyKnish22,interesting the owner water carriers (nfl media) never ran with this. good for wagner dont need to lose 3 percent  of your money if you dont have to.
JoeyKnish22,hes gonna win it without an injury return not great enough at +137 to warrant a large bet banking on him missing time. i would leave it alone
JoeyKnish22,actually shouldnt talk about lindes bae like that. especially now that its pretty serious. wouldnt want him talking about mine like that. ill be more professional going forward.
JoeyKnish22,folks. maxs heisman analysis is over which means the standard garbage  has returned. take your screenshots now. patterson lifts 2 trophies this year. take it to the bank.
TheKostos,i didnt have hopkins in any leagues but imagine that tilt. 23 yards!!! against the bucs!!! obrien should have to spend a night in jail for this atrocity
TheKostos,"quote this tweet with the most annoyingly transparent attempt to get quote tweets and s disguised as some other form of content. 

(and no this tweet doesnt count)"
TheKostos,i didnt lose a single  college football  bet today. going to enjoy this for an hour or so and then start quietly weeping in anticipation of tomorrows bloodbath
TheKostos,that was a horrific hit by damarious randall. legitimately as bad as it gets. straight out of the 1970s. no place for it. should probably be suspended too
TheKostos,i was thinking this morning that it might take something like that to wake people up. i'm not trying to be an alarmist just rational about what's happening
TheKostos,"hugo lloris just said postgame tottenham played ""shy"" and they should regret the way they started. lmao. mourinho!! gotta love it. they're done. stick a fork in em"
LockyLockerson,another match-up of a team that plays inside vs. a team that plays outside. given her love of the ou touchdown oors i'm guessing she's leaning chicago lol
LockyLockerson,feel free! it probably wont be persuasive tbh but you can also check out splits for all 20/30/40 point underdogs going back across seasons results will be interesting!
LockyLockerson,"i'd re-classify that statement as more like ""total wild card."" has completely bricked/bled before this too and has still won after although obviously race complexion against her here."
LockyLockerson,congrats chiefs! was very weird to not have a bet on the winner of the game.  kind of enjoyable.  can actually appreciate the achievement of winning the game.
LockyLockerson,say what you want about saban but i love him on the set in these big games.  always a transparent honest discussion of the game in key areas.
EliHershkovich,knew i should've bet msu. winston so good in bounce-back spots  sparty's d has shut down edwards. says a lot about what to expect in va. tech-dayton too.
EliHershkovich,i get all the criticism over lions-packers' refs but green bay also got screwed by the zebras vs. philly. it goes both ways. human error is the expectation.
EliHershkovich,"how-to listen to  ""you better you bet"" or any of our shows on-demand:

* download the  app
* search 'em under ""podcasts""
* subscribe sit back  tune in"
EliHershkovich,books had to price it that way with an elite dodgers' offense. strasburg kept rolling along though. just need scherzer to get healthy for my nats nl futures.
EliHershkovich,we've seen brandon jennings emmanuel mudiay terrance ferguson go this route. besides jennings to an extent hasn't exactly paid off in the long-term. hampton the latest to try.

DannyParkins,i enjoy our weekly conversations with  i think his competitiveness and love of the game really shines through even when the results on the field clearly devastate him.
DannyParkins,i hadn't seen this number until  story today. the bears have to make a decision on mitch trubisky's 5th year option this off-season. the price tag? $24 million.
DannyParkins,"wait... i missed this postgame. really?! then how do you not kneel towards his preferred hash? or obviously run it towards his preferred hash?! 

this keeps getting worse."
DannyParkins,"what if i told you the funniest play of the year in the nba happened in a game that didnt count?

30 for 30 presents: javale faked it"
DannyParkins,kliff kingsbury is learning! after leading the world in short  field goal  attempts he goes for it on 4th and 2 and kyler walks in for a touchdown.
DannyParkins,man thats a great seal by draymond to deny gasol while positioning himself to closeout on lowry who was most likely to get a pass. elite defensive stuff.
DannyParkins,you're just name calling and spouting what i would say are falsehoods. have a good one would love to talk to ya sometime if you're up for it.
DannyParkins,i feel like this is pertinent information if anyone is trying to extrapolate meaning from that matchup to what a potential 7 game finals series would look like.
DannyParkins,it is  time for  (which you should subscribe too as a podcast) on   and a bunch of other stations around the country with my guys   tune in now.
chadmillman,i love bettors because they think opportunity first sport second. case in point: the second most popular page on our site right now is college basketball betting percentages.
chadmillman,project 256 betting every game continued last night with under on vikes-skins (nice work on  by  and  more to come this weekend. not afraid of jinxes! follow along.
chadmillman,sorry about that. will share with the customer service team. dm me the email with your account so they can respond if need be. thanks for heads up.
chadmillman,good day to bring on  nba finals odds breakdown deep dive on lakers drama and how it impacts free agency odds + who controls power in player movement.
chadmillman,"this story by  is so true. bama-oklahoma was the perfect betting game. ""the game itself never really seemed in doubt but the point spread was always in doubt."""
chadmillman,want a bracket based on our  ratings? how about  prefer to use  like a bracket with lots of upsets? lots of favorites advancing? this simulator tests them all.
chadmillman,recorded great podcast segment with yday. also its get your prop up in vegas time. winner gets on big board at orleans for super bowl. send to propscontest
chadmillman,if scooch and i podcasted today: scooch would say his scooch roulette pick is buffalo +8 vs atlanta. i would say my pick is sea -13 vs indy.
Gingfacekillah,has some of the best information available on testing betting records for statistical significance on his website.  it is  well worth reading as much as you can there.
Gingfacekillah,that is  the glory of wyts. you get to laugh your way through the whole league until  it is  your team's turn to get kicked in the pills
Gingfacekillah,a little tighter than i would've liked but all in all a nice cash. a few missed loaded base opportunities could've easily packed on additional hre's. one down!
Gingfacekillah,currently working on a hre prop model an exact score mlb add-on to my current baseball model and possibly something for  hour k total bases props as well.
Gingfacekillah,best line from first episode: [krack explains his methodology]: i work as part of a team....weve got a guy with a model...and theres another guy that reads alot.
Gingfacekillah,xg or mov are basically your two main modelling choices. xg proves more useful for exact scores and totals. forecast a reasonably accurate lambda and you're in business
Gingfacekillah,"bos by 13 and the over hits. quarters were a little wonky but a nice forecast overall.

predicted bos: -13.2 224.06
result: bos -13 227.

bos/over cash nicely."
Gingfacekillah,not going to lie its very difficult. even when you think youve got something that works you cant be entirely sure its not just luck in many instances.
logan_matthews9,when will you have a podcast to address the claims that you had multiple initial models that did predictions and only promoted the results of the best one?
logan_matthews9,theres like two players who you could make arguments for to be on the team that werent. people just build up these youngsters who havent disappointed him yet
logan_matthews9,this is a really dumb discussion because people just do not have 5k bets. if you arent adjusting your model every couple months its not a good one
logan_matthews9,carlos gil the biggest all star snub or is ne too bad to have a real shout? hes almost certainly one of the best 8ish midfielders in mls
logan_matthews9,this line dropped more so im loading up. at -2 not sure why besides adams and noel are questionable (but ill guess they both play and definitely noel)
PikachuBets,3.5k on overnight  college basketball  sides on a yopig skin? that is highly highly unusual. you dont know  what the fuck  youre talking about if you think otherwise

adamchernoff,they use a weird hybrid turf field scuffs up real bad. nfl games tend to tear up fields much more than soccer matches. can definitely play a factor.
adamchernoff,"my record on the nfl season for  is 6-2 (+6.32x). 

double bet cashed in yesterday and there is still more to go tonight. 

full writeup for monday night:"
Ccon8181,here come the #buccaneers !! 4 turnovers... going into halftime tied! #nfl needs that tenn houston game to mean something next week. #texans not blowing anyone out. #houvstb
Ccon8181,hate having to root for rivers and #chargers ... like his competitiveness but its mostly masked by his complaining. all will be forgiven if they cover tonight. #kcvslac
Ccon8181,quick question for #nfl fans. are you in favor of the nfl creating rules to protect players or treating it like gladiators in a coliseum (free for all)
Ccon8181,bang!! dodged the overtime and got the win and cover with #utahjazz ... blew a big lead but well take it. onto the next. big weekend on deck
Ccon8181,based on the 2nd half line... and having eyes seeing the #bears product on the field first half. theyre going to lose outright let alone cover 4. shitty
Ccon8181,i bet the #athletics today +120 personally and damn this shits frustrating!! error leading to runs. stranded base runners. hate wagering on bases.. ready for tonights #nbafinals game.
Ccon8181,whew big 1st half cover with ingles hitting that 3.. rubio tried to turn it over but ingles bailed them out. still dont know what rubio does well!!
Ccon8181,wish i could. i used too but my account got suspended. now i just bet through cg mgm and they dont offer in play for more then $300
Ccon8181,i think youre right. the rules have catered to the fantasy football crowd leading to more scoring. seems this is the brand of football ppl like to watch.
Ccon8181,#browns gonna get the with this week. made the cut but i cant keep throwing money down that hole. so of course they cover this week. f em
Ccon8181,one last thought.. to the ppl saying you just have to laugh about it- im risking 10k+ a game of real $ - i'm not laughing about shit.
Ccon8181,so #giants going to try and ride out the early 7-3 lead and hope it stands up lol.  what the fuck  is the matter with these clowns. smh
Ccon8181,#gsw will roll tonight imo numbers just  daily fantasy sports  back them for me to put $ behind it. i was a game premature when they played #celtics
Ccon8181,#zags handle business but have to settle for 3-1-1 day... should of been 4-1 at worst.. f it gonna go club it up tonight get out the pad
kellyinvegas,my lovely co-host  gives out a mini version of the card and it starts tonight in the byu hawaii game. hint: its at the end of the show
kellyinvegas,appreciate the rams making tonight easy. cause today was a bitch. knocked myself from 2nd place in my league to 12th. barf. back to work for next week.
kellyinvegas,that 5th best team just beat your 2nd place team. no? and when your 1st beats your 3rd youre in the same boat as the big 12. congrats.
kellyinvegas,i get this question a lot.  puts his out for free on his  page  has an amazing numbers mag he puts out  for a website i really like
kellyinvegas,baylor helped saved some face. if the last two come in on the card for  and what i gabe our on  all will be right in the world
kellyinvegas,if you want to make $ just bet against  in the first half. its nuts how much they dont care until the last 5 minutes of the game.
kellyinvegas,obnoxious? because i bet early? we know if youre betting saturday and sunday mornings your chances of losing are much higher. the lines sunday morning are the tightest.
ToddFuhrman,hey  if the dolphins screw themselves out of draft position with a win today can we get a post holiday rant on  thursday? our listeners would love it
ToddFuhrman,"imagine explaining to new  college football  fans that sec games were traditionally played first team to 17 rather than the 2019 version of the league

(sorry uga fans)"
ToddFuhrman,the sicko in me wants to see northwestern and umass get middled at non-key numbers by falling 39. would be the most fitting end to this gambling picasso
ToddFuhrman,i hauled ass this morning mikey; payne told me he was going to fire me if i didn't get this thing rolling sooner to make the lunch window
ToddFuhrman,even more reason to keep them for later in the year when the rest of the pool can only use them once; mirroring the competition kills your edge
ToddFuhrman,i think the broncos are interesting; 3rd best team in that league but should be much improved this season  that is  for sure just by being buttoned up
ToddFuhrman,. dedicating his time to sports gambling seems like a stretch but its a still a great listen and have to thank  for letting us tarnish his brand
ToddFuhrman,exactly right thin slicing like malcolm gladwell described when you can't quite explain why something looks off but experience tells you  it is  not passing the sniff test
ToddFuhrman,im watching these games in jersey and have zero clue how people can watch anything on the west coast and get to work on time the next morning
ToddFuhrman,we got nailed one year because we kept a list of all the entries with who paid and who didnt. teacher confiscated everything damn paper trails ruin everything
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to the current gambling gambling gold rush of content we're currently living in (across all platforms tv radio digital etc) what's most important to you?
ToddFuhrman,mkes two of us...think its stay away territory or maybe take a shot on a few bombers since i believe were going to see a few big wrecks
TheCousinSal,kudos to usman and to covington who lost but fought for 3 rounds with a broken jaw.  i personally would be able to endure 2 at most. #ufc245
TheCousinSal,gigantic road win for the texans today. and just like that the chiefs who cant protect their qb are no longer a lock for the afc championship game.
TheCousinSal,pat schurmur is yet another to fall victim to belichicks spell.  punting on 4th and 2 down 14 with 7 minutes left is playing to cover...not to win.
TheCousinSal,dont wanna brag here - but when it comes to pulling a ball out of a hole i am definitely better than  maybe at putting too. #openchampionship #hometownbust
TheCousinSal,this reminds me of the time ned stark was beheaded by his own sword. oops...spoiler. load up    it is  all destined for your canadian cranium. #maplesyrupmakeover #torvgsw #lockitin
TheCousinSal,incredible! when you cant gain a yard in 6 tries and the other team needs one play to get 99...its time to get back on the bus. #jaxvsten
TheCousinSal,im going to say something very controversial here. i dont think sister jean sitting quietly in the stands has a ton to do with this teams success. #finalfour
TheCousinSal,if the vikings patriots steelers 49ers seahawks chargers lions redskins and saints dont all win on a money line parlay people are going to be really pissed. #chalkeaters
TheCousinSal,hue jacksons 1/2time speech: if we continue to play at a high level well run the risk of covering 2 games in a row. dont let me down
12Xpert,indeed so but not the best to level stakes. that honour goes to norwich by virtue of beating manchester city. liverpool are 4th. (lsp = level stakes profit).
12Xpert,there's a hint that the bias is weakening (more bettors aware of it?) but i'd not like to stake my reputation on saying  that is  definitely statistically significant.
12Xpert,no idea how you calculate edge here. as far as i'm concerned they are the same thing. match 1 gives 16.67 percent  match 2 gives 25 percent .
12Xpert,this might be useful in this context. how closing line value is so much faster than profits/losses at revealing potential skill (of course it assumes clvh is true).
mschwimer,i appreciate you listening with an open mind!  please listen at the 29:30 mark of the podcast for the exact reason we do not post estimates for bankroll.
mschwimer,any tout that makes people pay for losing picks i have a problem with. period. i believe people recommending picks should be in financial alignment with subscribers. period.
mschwimer,but then all our other ventures would have to go to 0 as well. and we have hundreds of millions in assets. it is possible. but highly unlikely.
mschwimer,yes. because i hate the tout industry that much!  and there is not a single book in the world that will let me bet big limits at it.
mschwimer,so are you saying that every single pick from 2/12 on is not detailed on the site? if thats what you are saying you are flat out wrong.
mschwimer,ok. so i want to be very clear. you dont trust that bill miller marvin bush david ganek and steve duncker are good for it. is that correct?
mschwimer,58 percent  vs. when we put in the plays. when we put them in our subscribers get an automatic email so they know the second we release picks.
mschwimer,"nba predictions.
1. stauskas will be a bust
2. payne will win roy next year
3. embiid will have the best career
4. hood will be a stud"
RufusPeabody,merry christmas everyone! my gift to you: this  bowl episode with  and  rife with audio issues as i recorded from the side of the road in maine.
RufusPeabody,people who think they have everything figured out ... generally  daily fantasy sports . the more you know the more you realize you  daily fantasy sports  know.
RufusPeabody,i would argue the opposite. a favorite should be less slightly less willing to go for two early since their chances of winning in overtime are greater.
RufusPeabody,so are your opponent adjustments stronger or does the opponent quality just not have prior anymore (whereas it was a weighted avg of prior and inseason before)
RufusPeabody,correct me if im wrong but havent teams been using analytics for some time now? they just prefer to keep their findings to themselves. competitive edge yknow?
RufusPeabody,i havent seen a tweet mentioning your record on free thursdays but if you were winning on those we probably would hear about it. thats the issue.
RufusPeabody,with tickpick you  daily fantasy sports  even see the service fee. well they say  it is  $0 but  that is  bullshit. how much is the seller getting?
jeffma,rufus and i revisit some of our favorite topics make some picks and debate whether you can ever make a bet big enough to betray your fandom
SportsCheetah,yup thats why they play the games. ou was clear choice at #4 way it shook out. oregon beats auburn or asu they get in. they didnt.
SportsCheetah,happy to do that can give our sides to rufus or something just  daily fantasy sports  want to publicly put all of them out there for now.
SportsCheetah,funny enough last year he was 11th on the team in net rating so the current glue guy fit on this years team probably helps a lot
SportsCheetah,pels not offering brandon an extension was the right call. he may have wanted to bet on himself this season anyway. but hes going to cost more.
capjack2000,interestingly out of those companies you just mentioned none have shown a net profit in any us state yet. gvc currently losing $50m per month in nj.
capjack2000,looks like betmgm updated their tc and by the looks of it they suspect some insider trading is being done and want to insulate themselves from it.
capjack2000,have you read the tc of the plugin? you are consenting to give them access to everything. i wouldn't be surprised if your webcam is fair game.
capjack2000,"here's why you can't just believe everything you read. this article makes you think a sportsbook will be opened at the linc soon. 

first the misleading story:"
capjack2000,"biggest takeaway for me today at #g2e: 

geocomply knows a ridiculous amount about your online betting session in nj. dont even bother trying to circumvent it. seriously."
capjack2000,i'm pretty sure that ruling has been made. dge only releases directors actions every two weeks but it sounds like they got the green light fairly quickly.
capjack2000,im refusing to give them any publicity. good or bad. not sure what theyre thinking coming in late to a saturated market with a wholly uncompetitive product.
capjack2000,i know where that place is...thats like going to north las vegas for cheerios and a banana. doesnt ocean have a place that specializes in cold cereal?
capjack2000,its amazing all the things that the  team got right in their first attempt while nj books with their years of experience in europe all tripped over.
capjack2000,"dont forget the two technical fouls!

its like that scene in the natural when gus guesses how much money is in roy hobbs pocket...dont forget the silver."
capjack2000,playing 1h derivatives for nba teams down 2-0 in a series appears to be an angle the market has adjusted for. i think that angle is dead.
capjack2000,"to be fair draftkings had a line of -275 on that game when he posted. so global liquidity was $257.48. 

dk is now -360 on that game."
capjack2000,to be clear sportsbooks will be allowed to purchase this information from mlb. bettors will not. mlb is creating an unfair market in the name of integrity.
dinkinc,probably betting a few system bets  tonight..... avs...kings ...vegas...and sharks..........teams that played yesterday against over-rested teams...  checking on vegas possible late scratches and dreding betting the sharks
dinkinc,kevin kerstein and  making the last two days in kentucky easy and enjoyable .. now off to columbus and   and  .. things are going according to plan
dinkinc,left my hotel room to get something from my car and came face to face with a skunk...  thought that was very cool...i think he liked me
dinkinc,the first check i use to see if someone is a good human being is if they follow   .... i haven't figured out the second check yet
robpizzola,im having a really good nfl season largely because ive been able to avoid any disastrous weeks so far. this is going to be a disastrous week.
robpizzola,"i always love looking back on early season nfl spreads just to see how out to lunch we were.

san francisco pk at cincinnati in week 2"
robpizzola,look for the clip of him refusing to give us an interview even though you promised to donate $500 to the rivers of hope foundation live on-air.
robpizzola,well im assuming they didnt take any money back so that they can make a play for a free agent forward but yikes thats a bad return.
robpizzola,ive watched this video about a dozen times and am still trying to understand how this is possible. its like they hit a deer in the sky.
robpizzola,theres someone on the bruins that has been absolute garbage tonight but i cant tweet his name or hes guaranteed to score a goal in the third.
RASPicks,be sure to let  and dozens of other sharps know they are gullible followers. also good luck with those services who's lines  daily fantasy sports  ever move.
RASPicks,our volume varies i'd refer you to our what to expect pages at  for latest expectations.  as for your other question lots of reasons but primarily logistics.
RASPicks,if you really believe that you shouldn't be part of this conversation.  if you  daily fantasy sports  really believe it suggests some sort of agenda/misinformation campaign.  why?
RASPicks,.co/jhasgoas poster steviey has hit 55 percent  (adj for -110) for +118 flat units on 2195 picks across nfl/nba/mlb/ college basketball / college football /nhl since 2010.
VegasRefund,ill be in hawaii this week and i fully expect to miss a tip or two due to the 6 hour time difference ill be adjusting to.
VegasRefund,in terms of recent marvel movies... enjoyed ragnarok and galaxy 2 more.. civil war with dr. strange not far behind are my all time marvel fav's though.
ProfessorShine,he has access to lots of info in many sports which is a battle itself.  i have respect for anyone who bets their own cash of course.
ProfessorShine,seems to be that producers of these shows dont think certain aspects of sports betting are entertaining.  so they almost purposely omit things like those pesky prices.
suuma810,"incase you missed it : my detroit #lions 2019 team preview!

maybe bold but i wouldn't be surprised if they started the season with a 1-5 record:"
suuma810,the result doesnt make it a wrong decision. you go for it in such a high probability situation and try to ice the game. agree to disagree
suuma810,lowvig has already released a line for the #chiefs / #rams game in week eleven. la is favored by -3 at -121 with a total of 59.5.

ClevTA,notice during his presser how jimmy made sure to note that example of analytics and formations plays etc that fit what baker does well. makes u think
ClevTA,its some of the best bettors in the world who use models and refuse to think its possible to actually handicap motivation so they essentially ignore it
ClevTA,vrabel is just an ok coach. he is t some guy that teams are clamoring for. u said gregg williams. thats a majority of the horrific take
ClevTA,typically one of the biggest disadvantages in the nfl is a rookie hc preparing for a thursday night game. ladies and gentleman freddie kitchens is up next
ClevTA,like the last 5 tweets and ig posts from brendan are about this bachelor thing. hes really laying it out there for the world to know haha
ClevTA,carolina was definitely a consideration bc i dont think allen is that bad. i am concerned about that defense and short being doubtful. it just missed tho
ClevTA,expected points added on most any punt that results inside the 20 is marginal at absolute best btw best and worst punters anyways. thats the real stat
CizzlingSports,i'm 100 percent  blocked; have been since 2016 i think since telling him how stupid it is to use stale wed. contest lines for sun nfl commentary
CizzlingSports,you have to subtract 181.06 from their cumulative record each today to determine the real record beginning on 9/3/19 which is the day the 17-week package started.
CizzlingSports,"wow a guy who sellz loosing gambooling picks loves all manner of aribtrary end points whodathunk it

spanky,johnny the ceo was a perfect gentlemen.  i wish nothing but the best for them in the future. hopefully if limits ever increase ill be back. (2/2)
spanky,why would i do that. so people can like me more and i can get more followers?  im not seeking anyones approval.  i bet. i dont sell.
spanky,maybe someone could fill in the four variables of chance each team scores a fig and a  touchdown ... i wanna be convinced im just not lol....
spanky,of all the cats ive met from twitter universe these last 8 months there is no one sharper than  hes also a hell of a nice guy...
spanky,not sure... johnny is a bettor himself.  he understands the business.  i just  daily fantasy sports  think they are ready for someone like me at this time....
spanky,i was given 2500 on  college basketball  sides and 1300 on  college basketball  totals.... 300/game is not worth my time to stand there and bet all day

PlusEVAnalytics,listening more closely to the lyrics the differences between we wish you a merry christmas and m.o.p.s ante up (robbin hoods theory) are purely stylistic in nature.
PlusEVAnalytics,or a nightclub or any other business where there is conspicuous consumption and guys can measure their dicks according to how much money they give to me
PlusEVAnalytics,and i would walk 9.7 more just to be the man who walked (...hold please adding it up...) 19.4 km to fall down at your door da-da-duh
PlusEVAnalytics,i used the report a post function to report the post. there was an option for this is a photo of me that was not authorized. great.
PlusEVAnalytics,the term best is vague it can either be descriptive (has been the best) or predictive (is projected to be the best in a hypothetical future game).
PlusEVAnalytics,ha thats a stupid narrative. the thrill and enjoyment of gambling is there just as much on +ev bets as it is for negative expected value bets!
PlusEVAnalytics,related: go buy a lottery ticket today because your chance of winning is 1 in 2! (either you win or you dont) happy probability ignorance day everyone!
aluckyaday,well as they have all signed up to the boris deal which is effectively a border in the irish sea i doubt you will have many takers!
aluckyaday,a blanket ban does seem to highlight a lack of understanding of the bet as does highlighting someone who got lucky as a reason for dropping it!
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  know many clients what would like it either! they want a push button approach. show me the bets and hand me the cash!
aluckyaday,my two penneth on teasers. any bet where a fixed formula is used to convert odds from one market to a derivative market can throw up possibilities
aluckyaday,the human brain is a funny old thing. it tends to remember the close loses but forgets the close wins. something to do with evolution and survival
joeytunes2,from a pure pr perspective clemson is favored. this is where you find value. if clemson is getting points you bet your ass clemson will take money.
joeytunes2,phony the openers. bet everything through locals and trading on monday tuesday. wednesday bet more everyone's models are ran by then. middles and scalps  friday and saturday.
joeytunes2,i got a game i'm ready to rip tomorrow at full market. yea wake -3 i got too. few numbers were way off. at a vegas book.
joeytunes2,your a clown. you sell out. this shit shouldnt even be allowed   promoting junk.  stick to what got you not laid in your teenage years   fantasy football
joeytunes2,i'll give you my football. just get me accounts.  that is  all. all mine. post and i'll free roll ya. i know money is tight for ya.
joeyisaks,ya perf right in time for monte carlo tournament which i  is we supposed to be at  and wont refund me even though not allowed to travel
joeyisaks,its actually an interesting concept that economically if implemented correctly would fix a lot of things  read about it and educate yourself before jumping to a conclusion
joeyisaks,because i dont need 7k that bad and for someone who wants to bet 1 millions or not bet why do u want my 3k that bad?
joeyisaks,i have a few of those skins  theyre ok. i obv i prefer bookiemarkets cause theyre softest but usually broke   metallic backend i like a lot too
joeyisaks,yeah. bookies are getting stupider by the day.  i should share some texts i get daily. but like u thankful for any account i can get nowadays
joeyisaks,its a weak division. can upgrade catcher mid season if needed and no reason to over pay harper or machado when next year can spend more freely
EdMillerPoker,most models suck so  it is  dealt very defensively which means lots of rejections.  it is  considerably more popular at the few books that aren't as defensive.
EdMillerPoker,"oh professionals often straight bet into market lines. which is part of the reason ""you"" (i.e. implying not a professional) likely won't win trying to do that"
EdMillerPoker,there are tons of great constructive exciting opportunities in sports betting including on the media side. bloomberg for sports isnt at the heart of any of them.
EdMillerPoker,hmm im not sure.  for what  it is  worth  all that material and much more is being published as a book in the next month or two.
EdMillerPoker,another lsp article seemed to suggest that fd gave away most of that $ on a promo. is that wrong? if not  that is  quite the promo.
EdMillerPoker,dk might be paying over a million in overlay but if they can bink rufus brand ambassador will be money well spent no doubt.. :) gl rufus
EdMillerPoker,tho funny id be surprised if this was actually the story. if you have time would you mind telling me what their in-play  college basketball  limits are?
EdMillerPoker,this article both gets at a core truth and also overgeneralizes the thesis to absurdity which is i think a very effective formula for building a following
GolcondaFund,somehow playing in that division and getting the dolphins and jets cowboys got worse since last year. dear god get rid of jason garrett 5 years ago.
GolcondaFund,"we might have some serious alpha opp in sc and especially circa tw. 

0.5 points out of first  
 sportfolio plays will drop 2night for week 4 nfl"
GolcondaFund,"it is  hereee.
week 3 nfl sportfolios.

nonrandomalpha,had way more external distractions in 2019 v 2018 but look forward to improving our process over the offseason and closing in on 70 percent  in 2020!
nonrandomalpha,you dont know what happened? nagy has let him run...opening up everything else. playing 3 of the most recently challenged ds have also helped. not rocket science.
nonrandomalpha,i feel like tons of ppl talk about goff sucking as well lol - and really who cares tru is somehow less bad because goff also sucks?
nonrandomalpha,after the patriots game the browns could actually win every single game moving forward. why? because they start playing all the teams the ravens have already played.
nonrandomalpha,many of the folks who criticize lebron are simultaneously devout jordan fans but somehow must still be racists because they criticize lebron? your logic is airtight. thanks.
nonrandomalpha,love this energy. tru does not deserve to and should not be coddled or told good effort. nagy will not settle for a low ceiling from tru.
nonrandomalpha,"jeffrey/jackson duo may have been top 5 receiving core in 2015 not in 2019.

i do like upside of jj arcega-whiteside and braxton miller as backups tho."
LeeSharpeNFL,"no bears kicker has ever missed a field goal down 1-2 points in the final drive.

( daily fantasy sports  fact check this or reference past games.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i love visiting vegas and this new stadium looks awesome. i'm excited to go to next bears at raiders game there in...

*checks calendar*

seven years? :("
LeeSharpeNFL,this chart really shows how many times the packers tried to give this game to the vikings in the first half and the vikings kept refusing it.
LeeSharpeNFL,lions currently hold the #3 draft pick but are winning 10-7 over the broncos and would fall to the #6 pick if they hold on to win.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i suspect this is mostly a combination of recent team movement and variance. 

but it is true overall that hfa generally has been going down over time:"
LeeSharpeNFL,i didn't even link to the tweet i posted the gif natively (though it does say  in the corner). but yeah i'm not trying to sell anything.
LeeSharpeNFL,kudos to  for paying out team win total wagers as soon as the outcome is certain as opposed to waiting until the full regular season has concluded.
LeeSharpeNFL,if you tragically are celebrating thanksgiving where watching football isn't an option you can sneak some looks at my scoreboard on your phone. updates every 60 seconds:
LeeSharpeNFL,same. and honestly i'd be angry if my partner showed up with two new cars as a surprise too. we have a budget  what the fuck .
LeeSharpeNFL,"this ""draw marginally less attention to  garrett hitting rudolph with a helmet by skipping the game to a less visible time slot"" is the most nfl move."
LeeSharpeNFL,"if you're a neutral fan just wanting to watch exciting football this was one of the best early game slates all year. 

football is an amazing game."
whale_capper,road teams are 20-9-2 (69 percent ) covering by 5 points on average... will probably regress but its surprising how few teams have been impacted so far
whale_capper,i was being a little tongue in cheek the books have making it harder to play basic strategy teasers which are high +ev plays throughout the season:
whale_capper,assuming they pull off a third max id say its way too high... if they balance the roster around lbj and ad its probably a good number
whale_capper,glad you enjoyed it and like so many things about sports betting we all have to learn things the hard way for some reason thanks for listening
whale_capper,completely see that... greater uncertainty though expecting a team to win a championship on the fly like this chemistry takes time (or at least it always has)
whale_capper,nice can't make a call on the side at this number defensive adjustments are there for the dubs so this seems like the best angle of attack
AndyMSFW,"i'm still in holiday "" daily fantasy sports  quite know what day of the week it is"" mode and just realized there is nfl football on tomorrow!"
AndyMSFW,i did not watch the movies and do not understand that reference.  i am waiting for my little sister to text back to explain this to me.
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  fully understand?  why  daily fantasy sports  you post what you bet when you bet it.  it seems like that would be pretty accurate.
AndyMSFW,as if there wasn't reason enough to fire jay gruden. kicking 21 yard  field goal s to turn a two score game into a two score game.
AndyMSFW,be touchdown si and 5dimes are the only ones i know of.  that said 5dimes shades some lines to keep you from using certain +ev teaser strategies.
AndyMSFW,imagine being that shitty at estimating how many hogs are running into your yard. especially if you have 3-5 minutes to get some sort of head count.
AndyMSFW,"con: both cities telling the rays that they love them very much and  it is  not their fault (they know deep down it is)

AndyMSFW,so anyways this is what i bet for the weekend.  need something to sweat sunday while i come down from the derby.  tees off at 7am est.
AndyMSFW,not sure what to make of the guy with the canadian flag and the italian soccer team avi replying to a post about american basketball in german.
JoeyKnish22,"talked about a couple wc weekend props on the  my favorite of the bunch:

most rushing yards wild card weekend at  
devin singletary +700
sony michel +700"
JoeyKnish22,i love the pickzzz accounts coming to the defense of the other pickzzzz accounts on this app lmao. like a shill family christmas gathering for the holidays.
JoeyKnish22,"lost in the shuffle of all last nights browns/steelers fight drama was the most important aspect...

(was a great night all around for ravens division futures )"
JoeyKnish22,didnt actually bet it. think seattle might park the bus was gonna take +1.5 but it steamed on me. dont have a real lean either way tbh.
JoeyKnish22,had some fortune with stanford injuries but also stanford much worse than even i could have imagined. but yeah should be some nice closing line value here.
JoeyKnish22,if you look close enough you can see the ball hit my wallet when it drops in the net and what little money was left is gone.
JoeyKnish22,took me 12 weeks of serving mahomes kool-aid to fend off the nfl media brees apologist campaign. im primed and ready for a full season burrow sauce.
TheKostos,man listen ill just watch old super bowls if i get upset  (on a serious note yes your team has kicked my teams ass recently for sure)
TheKostos,there's no way a stat correction would be six points right? i won one matchup by 5 and sat the bills defense to prevent a doomsday result
TheKostos,"especially early. had john brown a few times. if he hits even one of those could be a different game. v annoying!!

(i bet on the bills)"
TheKostos,is that gonna be it for lamar and ingram? i need that to be it for lamar and ingram. my 90 point lead is now 4 lol
TheKostos,one-loss oregon or utah as pac12 champs getting in if georgia loses. the question will be: what happens if uga beats lsu in sec the title game?
TheKostos,standby. fixing now. you can watch the show also at the link provided in the  tweet. going thru the  college basketball  card now starting with illinois/penn state
TheKostos,barely saw my girl last month with all the chicago  trips so if i cap and bet tonight it might be the end of my relationship lol
TheKostos,whale is way too california cool to not show himself. i say this as an extraordinarily vain person so i think my opinion matters more than most
TheKostos,man i'd be down for the breds myself but i'm a 10.5 in 350s. dope pair you should be able to get a nice price for them
TheKostos,i love all the contestants on the various mtv shows that come from love island so no doubt the show is great. def gonna check it out
LockyLockerson,i have a really hard time figuring out your tone on here lol.   it is  like playful but kind of antagonizing but also supportive?  you're an enigma.
LockyLockerson,"monday nba overnight projections + analysis now up over at patreon. 

a truly fascinating group of games with stars returning from injury and some really interesting openers."
LockyLockerson,real sports profile of richie incognito is pretty wild in that its totally comprehensive.  there were a ton of arrests and incidents i didnt even know about.
LockyLockerson,in some cases the numbers have moved too far in my opinion (indiana iowa state etc.) but mostly just my ratings vs. market plus my weirdo intuition.
LockyLockerson,when i went to college near a sheetz they carried this stuff called gallikers that was straight crack.  addictive and totally bad for you.  best chocolate milk.

DannyParkins,youre too kind always happy to come in when i can... and i definitely get tired its why i sleep in without an alarm monday-saturday whenever possible.
DannyParkins,starting the national show a little bit differently tonight. you can listen on the score or sirius 206 or your local cbs sports radio affiliate or here:
DannyParkins,that is  awesome man seriously. no matter how my career goes i'll always be grateful to espn1000 for giving me my first chances to host back home.
DannyParkins,i mean i didnt wanna make the maybe eloy shouldve stayed in the minors to work on his defense a few more weeks joke felt too easy
DannyParkins,like bill murray in stripes with the end of old yeller im not too proud to admit i cried on this day in 1995... whos with me?
chadmillman,a dictionary project that started in 1890 and once was moved to a bunker because of nuclear bomb fears. it still continues. this story is nuts.  via
chadmillman,warning: do not listen while driving operating any other kind of heavy machinery or walking absent mindedly. these voicemails are legendary. im not mad im just disappointed.
chadmillman,credit  i follow him in the action network app and got an alert when he hit that game at bk +6. go download! follow phan    and more.
chadmillman,less than 24 hours to listen to everything  said about the masters before it starts from his rankings to tigers long ball to spieths secret to success.
chadmillman,just filled out my bracket for our  contest. win cash win subscription. beat my very un-chalk picks (although im not eligible to win so youre lucky). .
Gingfacekillah,thats exactly what im going for. im very excited to be releasing it soon. just finished my msc data science homework for the week back to writing
Gingfacekillah,finally in the black for the season. bet into some trash lines early in the season clawed my way back. +0.85u. ~56 percent  win rate. rolling now.
Gingfacekillah,he's way above his shooting percentage expectations too. taking a closer look. like to try and analyze where the model broke down when its off that badly.
Gingfacekillah,my best forecast for tonight's nba 3pt competition. likely winners seth curry steph curry joe harris. best expected value: joe harris dirk nowitzki. #nbaallstar #nba #sportsbetting #gamblingtwitter
Gingfacekillah,clearly the open is the point of minimum efficiency so thats good but optimally wouldnt we also want maximum information?  about things like lineups and injuries mostly?
Gingfacekillah,"sunday nba totals:
det/orl over 204
chi/tor over 208

i've got both games capped with a heavy lean on the over. good value. #sharpaction #handicapping #sportsbetting #nba"
logan_matthews9,i have alt overs of 69 and 74 but frankly 67 is fine just because hes the only guy in the world who would miss the under
logan_matthews9,michael - do you ever plan on addressing rufuss claim that you ran multiple models during the testing period? i was told you were all about transparency?
logan_matthews9,good thing you dont have any philly followers who routinely try to troll you... because they would probably get mocked severely and youd hate to see that
PikachuBets,too risky to get caught with the accts getting exposed but at this point nobody cares anymore about the secrecy bc we all know he is torching
PikachuBets,havent had my dick tickled this magnificently for this long since college. efes gonna major cuck this last 1:40 of game. prob lose by 6 just watch
PikachuBets,"honestly can you just stop calling it ""o/u"" bc  it is  called a fucking total to the rest of the world who actually knows how to gamble"
PikachuBets,looks like the line is now bkn +8 so my play is +8 now. thats how it works right? you always take the better line when offered?
adamchernoff,no doubt there. abundance of demand from all angles. i just felt like it was a lazy effort all around which is not something i was expecting.
adamchernoff,not betting either way just trying to offer some value on what is continuing to be a more and more common way to handicap second half wagers.
adamchernoff,two words you need to use every time you bet on a game. instantly change your mindset and force yourself to handicap both sides of the matchup.
Ccon8181,still pissed about #tcufootball #tcu ... so many opportunities.. had that game. got the number.. ended tied but we take the l. gotta move onto the next
Ccon8181,im not gonna like that tweet but ill take them winning by 3 haha. i hope not by more than that. they do look solid this year!
Ccon8181,ill put this out before too much value is gone. on #warriors +2 tonight. risky as i could see warriors scratching kd and raps going to -3/-3.5
Ccon8181,well if information is really valuable it can be worth something. i guess i want to find out if the ppl selling info are also wagering themselves.
Ccon8181,cmon #oregon  you blew an 10 point lead with under a minute verse ucla to cost me. go get this cover verse uw for a big night!
Ccon8181,on these two sides today. looking at one more. #texans -1.5 -110 risking 5 percent  #nflwildcard .. and #oklahomastate +10 -110 risking 3.3 percent  # college basketball
Ccon8181,cg one of two shops at +3.5 and never reached +4. have to pass with the fund. cant take a poor number. on #heat personally at +4
Ccon8181,brutal day as early look is #louisville didnt come out of the locker room went from worst 2-1 day to now 1-2. #wvu is last years georgetown
Ccon8181,"i thought the #celts throw away game was at home verse the pacers friday.nice of them to take the day off and mail in another one

#bosvscle"
Ccon8181,haha naw they were toast when they were up 10 and gave up an 80 yard drive and 30 yard  touchdown  with 10 secs left before half.
Ccon8181,"weekly recap: had to pass last week the numbers moved against us ending where they should have started

week: -
season: +22.24 percent 
y touchdown :+41.74 percent"
Ccon8181,i try to help others out but not at expense of eroding my edge. release plays late and cut off those who try to tout my plays
Ccon8181,first day of nfl in the sportsbook is like jan 1st at the gym.crowded with a bunch of ppl claiming it will be different this year.same story
Ccon8181,a little progress report. after a nice plus $ aprilthat makes it 7 out of the last 9 months we've profited. winner out the gate for may
Ccon8181,or check your junk file or find previous email and flag it as vip so it comes through. but i think  it is  a mail chimp issue
kellyinvegas,exactly. so why would a guy hitting 75 percent  not want to enter a million dollar contest. hmmmm and no social media. interesting. but im the clown
kellyinvegas,i lean towards the under actually. i know kstates secondary can be suspect and tech cant stop the run. but this has 31-24 written all over it.
kellyinvegas,how? lol you do realize what he has access to correct? and he gives it out for free. same people saying bad stuff about me. its incredible.
ToddFuhrman,"when analogies miss the mark

 daily fantasy sports  blow your bankroll on action bets (carbs); fire on the games where you actually have an edge (expensive proteins)"
ToddFuhrman,ha you know me too well travis had to take a jab here but yes the bears would trounce the best  college football  team even with mitch
ToddFuhrman,he knew he needed to change things up so he went out and brought in gattis. hasnt worked yet but at least he realized change was needed
ToddFuhrman,im still not sure if the no liquids travel policy is really for our safety or just an excuse to charge travelers $37 for every bottle of
ToddFuhrman,love of bbq sets him a cut above; maybe theres a market for me to review video poker bar beer specials in vegas? could be onto something...
ToddFuhrman,i'd expect more from  on those particular props unless it was listed at the time you wagered; i know  honors all fixed odds pricing regardless of scratches
ToddFuhrman,we'll be with you through the nba finals...good chance  stays on through the women's world cup to hand out winners because she knows it inside and out
ToddFuhrman,bingo the financials wont make sense on any of this and thats why the current model of being paid under the table will continue to perpetuate itself
ToddFuhrman,definitely value in the no and its the perfect illustration of why its ok to lay juice when the realistic probability doesnt mesh with a market price
TheCousinSal,my cousin  is finally doing something nice for others. his new book #theseriousgoose is out now. all the money he makes from it goes to childrens hospitals.
TheCousinSal,sorry jfk. for forcing me to touch an extra filthy button in a public bathroom i am downgrading an otherwise fantastic experience to the yellow meh face.
TheCousinSal,out of respect for the recently ousted james harden i plan on showing up to work on monday with pink eye...oh...and a crown atop my head. #kingofallgamblers
TheCousinSal,after 3 quarters james harden is 0 for 14 and the rockets are only down two points in utah. clear out room for that mvp trophy giannis.
TheCousinSal,that play was definitely exciting but the panthers and their fans are treating it like they just took a double digit lead with that 2 pt. return.
TheCousinSal,i would demand  donate today's salary to a worthwhile charity but - after seeing this i'm not positive he'd get the money to one that actually existed.
TheCousinSal,the degenerate trifecta and i discuss how to profit off of nba tankers ncaa conference tourney picks and  peculiar infatuation with the this is me soundtrack. #againstallodds

12Xpert,nice. i think i might try something like this but relative to the market expectation. as i did with my exploiting the hot hand fallacy betting system.
12Xpert,so minimum stake to clear a profit is price/yield. so suppose yield after slippage was 0.05 minimum stake to clear any profit would be 1.45/0.05 = 29.
12Xpert,if #albertosalazar is guilty of doping violations but none of his athletes have been convicted of doping violations what does that say about the drug testing regime?
12Xpert,really support or dislike for the eu boils down to globalism v localism. trump is a localist. the eu is globalist. which is better for peoples lives?
12Xpert,this is precisely it. which is why women's tennis and athletics is virtually on a level playing field with men's in terms of building narratives and stories.
12Xpert,the number of no-show sharps like you will be but a tiny proportion of the number of no-show squares. survivorship bias is much stronger in that direction.
12Xpert,meanwhile in other news  ceo kenny alexander faces a shareholder revolt over his pay packet. perhaps  that is  where some of his firm's affiliate revenues are going.
12Xpert,yes that would be of interest. either the post data mining results have been unlucky or there was never anything causal and you're just seeing mean regression.
JambosPicks,is correct. the 17 week package started in week 2. if the 17 week package ended this week subscribers would have made +$6841 after fees and guarantee.
JambosPicks,less than an hour away from the kickoff of the college football season! head to  and sign up to see our recommended plays for  -  and  -
JambosPicks,our (f5) pick was a winner and the #rockies head to the 9th with a 7-2 lead and a chance to get jambos subscribers a second w.
mschwimer,i would love to do that! obviously i have zero say in anything espn related but if they want to do it i am 100 percent  in.
mschwimer,and how did i respond when you asked to see the report? do you care to tell the full story? or only the part that is misleading?
mschwimer,in addition we could never cover all we need to cover on twitter. im sure it will be at least a half hour of back and forth.
mschwimer,full game and first half sides and totals. please go to our website and register for free. you can see all our previous plays! judge for yourself
mschwimer,also you should buy the 4 week package. no ncaa basketball. $900 to buy. $2000 back (including fee) if we cant beat the market. still good odds!
mschwimer,all our plays are time stamped using betcris. you can check line archives to confirm it was available. you get an email instantly when we post picks.
mschwimer,its about our model predictions. not clv. again if you think thats right then sign up and dont take any of our plays and get 2.3-1 odds!
mschwimer,whoever made that chart should love us and subscribe immediately. according to that chart there is no way we can win so that person will get 10k!
mschwimer,just got back from the mavs portland game. the mavs play like a team.  they have no athleticism to compete for a title.but with howard they do
mschwimer,lot of great games on today. im calling a usc upset over notre dame a northwestern upset over penn st. what upsets do u think will happen?
RufusPeabody,i've never understood why dislocations take time to heal. like it was popped back into place.  it is  exactly where  it is  supposed to be now.
RufusPeabody,yep though its debatable that with the new xp distance and more 2-pt attempts whether those are worth it. id have to look at my chart
RufusPeabody,right i was just asking why berry was calling him 'the best in the world'. he may be for all i know. i have no idea.
RufusPeabody,i had ou as 63 percent  to finish the season undefeated going into today so i  daily fantasy sports  think them winning out is a stretch.
RufusPeabody,"ncaa football  predictions midseason review (note that this uses my custom hfa  travel factors): 
n=328
mean absolute error= 11.7694
rmse= 233.4442

nice start to the year"
RufusPeabody,the fact that a system has existed in a certain way is a very poor argument for why it should continue to exist in that way.
RufusPeabody,just when you thought nfl gms were getting a little smarter... special shout out to the rams front office which doesn't seem to have any clue.
RufusPeabody,i think he's saying he would take +295. but i'm not a book and if i was i wouldn't offer true odds so  it is  meaningless.
RufusPeabody,"st. jude win probabilities post-r2: 
rahm 17.3 percent  fitzmagic 16.6 percent  cantlay 13.1 percent  koepka 6.3 percent  horschel 5.9 percent  rose 5.8 percent  rory 5.7 percent"
RufusPeabody,"that is  a good point. though selling picks is also ""transmitting wagering information"" so one could argue that a tout is also violating the wire act."
RufusPeabody,if i buy a mattress with bed bugs the right way to rectify the situation is obviously to send me two more mattresses with bed bugs.
RufusPeabody,if youve got time this is the story of the worst video game of all time! (disclosure: my super talented sister  hosts and produces the podcast)
RufusPeabody,not a hockey guy but despite boston holding a 34-to-19 lead on shots on goal it feels like the blues are playing better. am i wrong?
RufusPeabody,let me lay out this hypothetical: every recreational bettor is +ev but overbets their bankroll. the sportsbook will lose money overall and bettors will win overall.
RufusPeabody,some books do open before offshore for very small limits. you know what happens when offshore opens? voila their odds change to mirror the offshore number.
RufusPeabody,this is a good point. they're evaluating based on what info they have. it also leads to a huge advantage for someone who's successfully executed before.
RufusPeabody,if you looked at it over the course of many contests you could determine with a large degree of confidence i suppose. with one contest? nah.
jeffma,latest episode of  with talk about   system for fading the public  system for finding value in futures and my system for typing while on the podcast
jeffma,tout alert: congrats to my podcast partner  for his 6-0 week on college picks on the  pod. if only our nfl picks could be so good
SportsCheetah,haha wish i had actually bet it i was just mentioning the move up from 49.5 to 51.5 at the time and mad i missed out.
SportsCheetah,lawrence draw had been the nuts all game. saving that delayed fake draw semi jump pass to etienne over middle was the stone cold super nuts.
SportsCheetah,tearing the achilles or not though the point is (and i'd think you'd agree) playing injured can put a player at risk to get more injured.
SportsCheetah,im shocked the lakers late-game 30-foot 3 offense didnt work without ad around to grab orebs and block shots at the rim on the defensive side.
SportsCheetah,new furthest away -4.5 percent  11th percentile. amazing luka is as high as he is considering a good portion of his minutes are shared with porz.
SportsCheetah,its rough since in general trae is better/will be better than people expected but luka gonna be one of the best ever to rub it in.
SportsCheetah,it is  certainly a sweat now sf was pretty backed up anyway so  it is  at least a thought. easier to say after the fact though.
SportsCheetah,nice yeah if its a big score id lock up some profit now either way. im not too confident betting either side in that game anyway.
SportsCheetah,karl-anthony towns with 7 made 3s and 3 blocks tonight. only danny green did 7 + 3 last season (against the magic on april 1 2019).

i weep for the masses."
capjack2000,i think this article my get my award for most misleading headline of the year. i'm going to have to put it in a separate  tweet.
capjack2000,irony of the day: the buses that rutgers uses to transport fans from the college ave campus to the game had betmgm ads on the side.
capjack2000,nj has aaa mexican and japanese baseball available for betting. they had cuban baseball for one day until bet365 realized they weren't allowed to offer it.

capjack2000,lower barriers to entry are good in theory but marketing spend is still uncapped. the billion dollar companies are going to continue to dominate via that.

capjack2000,they're still the smartest guys in the industry. nothing would destroy the offshore industry faster than letting the key talent be hired by legal market operators.
capjack2000,"the 150000 people at churchill downs booing country house in the winners circle gives new meaning to:

""fuck you and the horse you rode in on!"""
capjack2000,hit gold with  this morning. perfect blend of bettor storyteller and likable personality. i think we'll be seeing a lot more of todd on vsin shows.
dinkinc,loved.... no way he plays another game this season and maybe more... smart people snap too.... you are really ridiculous and blinded by some team loyalty
dinkinc,0-1 and this loss was brutal.... most of the   horses turned off the game to watch mr. ed reruns and were shocked by the final score
robpizzola,i think i can agree with this. similar to tomlin. good motivator generally has his team ready to play. but in-game decision making is absolutely horrendous.
robpizzola,i still think russ can survive without an o-line since hes done it his whole career. but the play calling is still stuck in the 80s.
robpizzola,i played the over and the entire drive i was thinking that i was going to get fucked on a fourth down stop. thank you kliff.
robpizzola,if the reports are true and there were approximately three million people in downtown toronto today that means that roughly 8 percent  of canada was there.
robpizzola,down to 57.8 percent  (-137.2) after the soto scratch. if you managed -133 i'd still hold it but would not play current market price of -139.
robpizzola,i need to tweet about how terrible juve has been (again) today because thats pretty much their only hope of turning things around at this point.
RASPicks,yeah we did a short wnba 2nd half service in 2018 and as you indicated the record is right on the front page aka not deleted.
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  disagree but wanted to point out there are a bunch of ways handicappers can improve and evolve over time to mitigate tougher markets.
RASPicks,fair enough and just want to say i still appreciate and find value in your picks/thoughts on twitter so thanks for sharing them and good luck.
RASPicks,big fan of the  concept. but what are the ratings? other than a vague mention in ny times article last year have never seen numbers published.
RASPicks,hasn't been our best year .500 through week 7.  we no longer sell picks to public so it only harms us/clients to post a public archive.
RASPicks,wonder how much better you'd do y touchdown  if you allocated time from weaker sports to stronger ones. very hard to do all at high level.
RASPicks,ras college football service will begin releasing week 1 side plays as early as august 23rd join now to not miss a single piece of info.

VegasRefund,what would it take to get christopher nolan to do one more dark knight... cuz ill do it and im sure most of you would too.
VegasRefund,"total was at 136.. steamed down to 127.. then leading up to game time was steamed back up to about 133.

game ended with 128 points"
VegasRefund,i try not to criticize coaching decisions.. but niu attempting a fake punt there is one of the most baffling calls ive seen this entire year.
VegasRefund,jose's struggle probably will start trending on twitter.. but you can't teach athleticism and he clearly had a negative amount of it.. i blame dr. pepper.
ProfessorShine,amazed so many dont know ms hotty threesome before her showtime days.  shes made fun of fat girls and dead pro bettors but joeys not nice?
ProfessorShine,plus data doesnt equal greatness;  its about making the correct decisions.  pederson in philly took unreal heat for aggressive correct decisions. id say it worked out
ProfessorShine,units breakdown is silly also.         if it were legal id book you in a quick minute just for the lol.    but keep up those great writeups.
ProfessorShine,of course crawford\khan would end in a lousy way.  crawford was about a 90 percent  fav to win.  these are not supposed to be competitive fights.
ProfessorShine,i wont because big media has promoted frauds like pregame for years....and many even in sports media themselves have been fooled. avg bettor has no shot
ProfessorShine,the old garden st park location had always been mentioned as a future betting site. the fact it is held up is disappointing but not surprising
suuma810,"im at a point where i am almost happy to get booger tomorrow. at least his weird tales are kinda funny.

troy  joe are sleep pills."
suuma810,bettors love the buffalo #bills regular season win total to go over. i'm not drinking the kool-aid. my team preview is ready for all 2019 members:
suuma810,lets go: welche oliner kmen an 3 fr die jets infrage? der einzige der mir bis jetzt oft vor die augen gefallen ist - jonah williams.
suuma810,going into the week the #vikings defense ranked bottom-5 in dvoa vs rb passes. the #patriots rbs already have 6 receptions midway through the 2nd quarter.
suuma810,i think we shouldn't be arguing the fact that having solid qb play over the next five years is more valuable than having a good rb
ClevTA,i am no market expert but they have to be flooded with philly teasers right? how much does that force it down to pk at least?
ClevTA,i thought with all the guys who could be used bc of week 17 chaos that ownership wasnt a concern. so many cheap backups were available.
ClevTA,"nba dk contest. join in. i promise it will go off this time 

nba today at 12pm est - $20 entry - 1/20 spots filled  ***"
ClevTA,yeah i screwed up bc i didnt create it as a resize contest. so it had to reach a certain minutes to run. i didnt know
ClevTA,i loved manny albert and thome and was able to recover with multiple world series appearances following those departures. this isnt the nba with lebron leaving
ClevTA,i took -2. even if driskel does play his legs are his biggest asset so a bad hammy on a short week is a huge problem.
ClevTA,theres a lot of cannibalization going on in the next few weeks with these teams so no need to worry about anyone outside of oakland yet
ClevTA,remember the name? u are like 3  years too late. hey  we were putting bam in our  daily fantasy sports  lineups in 2017 i believe lol
ClevTA,ne got blown out in tennessee last year. rams got blown out at home vs eagles after multiple prime time gms. it happens to all tms
ClevTA,i just dont understand how that guy isnt smart enough to intentionally have a few losing sessions mixed in so nobody can tell u are cheating
ClevTA,college is not my game this early in the season. i need a few weeks of data first. so your guess is as good as mine
ClevTA,hilliard can spell chubb on a couple series and can handle the 3rd downs and is a pretty decent receiver. thats all u really need tbh
CizzlingSports,$23m in funding and they only have 50 17 week subs? what do you think the long-play is here?  it is  certainly not selling winning subscriptions.
CizzlingSports,good talk jayson. always cool to see another low-iq who's lost a middle class family's annual income at gambooling stan for  a real shock stun here.
CizzlingSports,".not to be ou touchdown one of course  also promotes  who in turn promotes  and 

if you aren't familiar with these two read  excellent investigative piece."
CizzlingSports,well u c  brand is built on fake outrage that panders to a right-leaning and/or low-iq audience but thanks for the stimulating taek jeph my goodness
CizzlingSports,"below is a thread examining issues with  account at 

 deleted his  account at a point when he was down around -571 units on his betting picks"
CizzlingSports,"lmao

well done as usual    featuring ppl who (1)  daily fantasy sports  bet and/or (2) loose a lot betting on you are new betting radio show"
CizzlingSports,fyi all you  stans (cc:  et al.)  is claiming the principal ( of a company kelly works for ( is a criminal tax cheat and stalker
spanky,"runners are not a long term solution. they would receive the same fate that i received within a few days.  

anyone betting professionally is betting offshore."
spanky,"they wouldnt dare offer me to speak because all the dressmaker sponsors would boycott the event in fear of me telling it like it is....

spanky,everyone is going through growing stages. be a little more understanding.  be thankful they dont boot anyone. you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
spanky,"in play different animal. 

0 second delay on everything pre game. why? because their software automoves their line based on amount and customer profile. nobody better"
spanky,"the only bookmakers that accept my action (in no particular order)  are:

 
 
 
 
 
----------------
 has promised to take me back for football
----------------
everyone else is a"
spanky,not in the least for me.  if it was 10k college football i would be horny. if it was 10k college basketball i would jerk off.
spanky,25 percent  freeroll with a red....  you are picks meet nothing to me johnny its your ability to get down that has caught my interest ....
spanky,and so it begins. the week where businesses across the united states lose billions of dollars due to march madness distraction.  proud to be an american
spanky,every time a nj shop has a losing month its assumed to be my fault.  im pretty good at what i do but not that good...
spanky,i've played into many offshore exchanges from betmaker to matchbook to betfair etc.  i have never once witnessed a liquid  college basketball  on any of them.
DocBettor,20 points in every game except for the one time i bet his points prop over and he got concussed in the 2nd quarter. good times!
DocBettor,it seems like the $10k guarantee is in the form of site credit which i'm guessing can only be used to buy more picks? cc #gamblingtwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,the test for liar vs nonsense is do you believe your own bullshit. the test for idiot vs degen is do you bet your own bullshit.
PlusEVAnalytics,if were talking nfl - this is no longer true. pinny raised their vig to -120 and lowered their limits on props a few weeks ago.
PlusEVAnalytics,thats total crap and you know it. obviously roi as a measure of skill has the same sample size considerations as any other measure of anything.
PlusEVAnalytics,as dumb as martingale is generally its extra dumb at blackjack. 32 units on the table and get dealt 88 then 8 then 8 then 3....
PlusEVAnalytics,im calling them shady because blackjack fletcher made a bunch of 200 unit bets. the fact that rovell did the same thing is just a bonus.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah up to the limit of $100 bet per store per person per day. any more than that and the store risks having their machine pulled.
PlusEVAnalytics,if your implied probabilities sum up to anything other than 100 percent  theyre probabilities in name only. please stop exposing your pinos all over my feed.
PlusEVAnalytics,exactly. there are a lot of cool ways to model this but i dont have enough free time to do it myself. want to work together?
PlusEVAnalytics,til at a french craps table not only is 11 years old as always but 10 is bonbon - i guess because dix sounds like six?
PlusEVAnalytics,if your heart is full of equity and youre an asset by the fundamental equation of accounting another part of your anatomy must be a liability.
PlusEVAnalytics,to extend that logic - there is an infinite supply of possible variables to be tested. therefore one can never prove that a market is efficient.
aluckyaday,true. i would think for a lot of people they would not understand the variance and over bet them. they are spanyk's plays. i can't lose
aluckyaday,oh jimmy. if done correctly a lucky 15 with bog is an huge +ev bet. the issue is most people  daily fantasy sports  do them correctly
aluckyaday,interview with  about his methods.  interesting that he only tips in the most liquid apt market and public biases seem a big part of the strategy.
aluckyaday,plus the fact that pinnacle choose to only accept bets from low tax jurisdictions. their model is not viable if they have to pay gambling taxes.
aluckyaday,"wait until the europeans give you the ""build a bet"" type features. its going to blow american's minds. as well as big holes in their pockets"
aluckyaday,have you tried looking at what happens if you use closing prices? it should be more +ev at close as we can classify qualifiers more accuratly?
aluckyaday,looks like international companies are well prepared for a no deal brexit. pretty simple really. if it happens we will just move out of the uk!
aluckyaday,"personally i would think its importance is actually going up because of bog. i'm sure that is a big reason for the ""hedging"" that goes on!"
aluckyaday,bit unfair on jungles if he is asked to eat wind today. guess  that is  the price you have pay for being with the top team.
theFirmAISports,its interesting to note that teams between +2.5  -2.5 have the largest error with this type of modeling even tho there is a substantial sample size
theFirmAISports,"#cfplayoff semi finals matchup -

clemson -2.5 (60 percent ) vs. ohio st. 

first real test for clemson coming in the playoffs... but they should pass"
theFirmAISports,im planning on updating the priors again (going to include the luck retirement) and running it one more time right before the real season kicks off.
theFirmAISports,starting the season off on the right foot. our inaugural first bet of the  college football  season! ridiculous finish to a sloppy fun game! #miamivsflorida 1-0
theFirmAISports,another bama vs clemson finals. as a fan of college football i want clemson to win. as a bettor money is on bama. win win situation.
joeytunes2,you wont ever find that kind of value in our lifetime. the greatest boxer of our lifetime. versus a guy who never boxed. think about that.
joeytunes2,it is  so sikkkk. i'm actually watching it laughing. he makes people look like they never played defense. in today's game no one actually plays defense.
joeyisaks,ya as soon as sports are announced back itll feel like a sense of normalcy and financial markets should start to rebound same time .... maybe
joeyisaks,socialism doesnt work and never has worked.. i wish the left didnt go so extreme and we could just go with bloomberg biden or mayor pete
joeyisaks,a decade working for a syndicate will make it hard to transition to something else if you suck at knowing how to make a resume only
joeyisaks,illinois state and belmont scored 97 points in the second half (none from fouling late) and the game still stayed under 151.5 by half a point...
joeyisaks,they dont need the best players to switch from pph to legal  / theyre banking on converting fans into new gamblers and sucking their money dry
EdMillerPoker,because nevada is a small market and was the only game in town. we started our business essentially the day the supreme court decision was announced.
EdMillerPoker,"this is a new poker-based esport designed by someones whose game design thoughts about online poker and gaming i have long admired.

definitely worth a look."
EdMillerPoker,every blue check with 100k followers now dunking on the guy just to make sure theres no sports fan in america who doesnt know his name
EdMillerPoker,as for the copying  that is  def a business problem but i *think* not as big a one as it might seem. we'll see on that.
EdMillerPoker,fox5 my fav local news and they have a new reporter  who seems great but cant help it my brain reads it as #adelsonnews every time...
EdMillerPoker,eroding public trust for profit is a meaningful part of major medias business model these days and anyone who denies it isnt being honest with themselves.
GolcondaFund,"damn  meant to post is anyone not on utah -6.5? baby duty got in way.

wah wah. have few more weeks to get that 10-0 ;)"
GolcondaFund,hard to see bama/saban laying egg vs fsu a team who struggled on defense too often ly. 1st half no trey marshall for fsu. bama spread/ml
nonrandomalpha,thats like saying wait til we discover cds or dvds or newspapers. in a digital world we prefer the medium that doesnt exist in physical form.
nonrandomalpha,so now youve shifted your argument from it was 10 yard quick slant that was all dt to it was an easy pass in between defenders...gotcha.
nonrandomalpha,i been waiting all offseason for this moment...too bad it took two injuries to materialize but jones has always been the best qb on the roster.
nonrandomalpha,if youre not accounting for doug pedersons analytically-tempered aggressiveness in your handicapping of #eagles games youre doing it wrong. one of the best in the game...
nonrandomalpha,hey new york city i  daily fantasy sports  think anyone has ever said this before but can you be a little bit more like new jersey?
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah i modeled it as off the bye for gb. (not treated any differently than when a team is coming off a regular season bye week.)
LeeSharpeNFL,"i take it back if the game ends with this score then the seahawks would end having scored 398 points and allowed 398 points.

perfect balance."
LeeSharpeNFL,gotcha. you can specify asp= in geom_image which helps with the ratio in my experience though you may have tried this. dunno about a distortion though.
LeeSharpeNFL,thanks! given that he probably is on the upper end of the range in terms of performance expectation sounds like he got himself a bad deal.
LeeSharpeNFL,probably a good idea for me to add that column especially if they do end up changing the structure (but  it is  not that hard regardless).
LeeSharpeNFL,there's only one game at a time today but if you're out and about with family today or tomorrow my live scoreboard will keep you updated:
LeeSharpeNFL,it all comes down to rodgers being overrated in the end.  (but this theory makes a lot of sense to me. highlight reels are powerful things.)
LeeSharpeNFL,"nfl/nbc decline to flex chiefs/bears out of sunday night football for week 16.

one more chance for trubisky to have a terrible game on national tv."
LeeSharpeNFL,the latter i think somewhat depends how much you attribute to coaching (and of course what the browns do this offseason there) but otherwise definitely agree.
LeeSharpeNFL,"every nfl play by play announcer needs to remove ""forced to punt"" and ""had to settle for a field goal"" from their vocabularies.

these are choices."
LeeSharpeNFL,"obviously you have not lived the bears fan life of seeing your qb throw it deep and being like ""oh no oh no plz plz plz"""
LeeSharpeNFL,oh nice! i went there many times back when i was in illinois and know a lot of that team.  it is  a well run show!
LeeSharpeNFL,nagy said trubisky had a knee injury earlier in the game. looked like in the second quarter? finally he didn't want him playing on it anymore.
LeeSharpeNFL,i think we may finally be at the point where going for it on 4th down is no longer shocking. calling this a win for #teamanalytics
LeeSharpeNFL,i do but  it is ... also on github. i can add one to my local server but not until later tonight when i am home.
LeeSharpeNFL,if the clock is winding down in the final minute both teams have 3 timeouts and nobody is calling timeout at least one team is wrong.
whale_capper,if their path has four games instead of three it becomes even more disparate... saints moneyline rollover for instance probably hits 10 or 12 to 1
whale_capper,there will surely be some hou support on the basis of jallen first ever playoff start so i think they give those folks a tougher number
whale_capper,have you noticed any other tendencies change in their play calling? seems like theyre running way fewer natural pick plays for some reason maybe saving them?
whale_capper,its a good point... car pace maybe dictated by game state being behind so much arz too maybe people think in a neutral game its slower?
whale_capper,i think tomorrow we're doing a video to break down the draw i'll tweet the link if you want to watch live and ask questions etc
whale_capper,makes me wonder if they are re-allocating or just shortening anything that gets hit... i  daily fantasy sports  remember it looking this bad when it opened
whale_capper,thats a lot of outlay on fed if (when ) he wins the first set id be prepared to cover some exposure with nadal live plays
whale_capper,for sure  that is  the case... fezzik sells a gazillion football packages every year to the unknowing because he won the super contest a decade ago
whale_capper,no opposite in my opinion... as it is with a fragile ad older lbj a super top heavy roster is a recipe for regular season disaster
whale_capper,back of the envelope math... dubs up 3-2 with kd have an 83 percent  chance to advance... dubs up 3-2 no kd ~58 percent  to advance
whale_capper,expecting they have known kanter was out since game 5 and have a plan in place to put aminu or similar on jokic and play small
AndyMSFW,"hump day six pack for me
   notes:
1. is delaware state the new pepperdine?
2. two of these are conference matchups!
3. i bet a favorite"
AndyMSFW,depends on the weather i suppose but i think they way the fellas have played the 3s the past decade it should be closer to -200.
JoeyKnish22,he charges a lot more but uses twitter but hes expanded to other forms of social and i think is mainly focusing on instagram these days.
JoeyKnish22,we are hoping you two will participate again but not an easy way to say this frankly youre both too stupid and lazy for pool management.
JoeyKnish22,i cant give out all the good stuff roof. maybe we start exchanging golf for volleyball in the dms. ill have my people contact your people.
JoeyKnish22,lmao $12.50 a month to watch the siac? youd have to pay me $12.50 to watch this slop (if i didnt have a bet on it).
JoeyKnish22,have a  college football  team total i really like this week will discuss with nick and joe call it the knishwich lock of the week .
JoeyKnish22,i should clarify a large part of that is getting the stream for all the fcs and mls games not just referencing the written insider content.
JoeyKnish22,"grabbed my phone out of the pool put it in some rice. turned it back on and bet: 
week 2 goy 49ers pk (-110) at bengals"
JoeyKnish22,not sure how this helps you or what to bet here. but i wont be eating there again for awhile  for what  it is  worth .
TheKostos,it actually offends me that he won another division. the afc south is such dogshit. how do you let this clown keep winning divisions??? hes terrible
TheKostos,four fantasy finals started winston in two and watson in another and it feels like all the work that went into the season has been ruined
TheKostos,i would never wish a horrible life on anyone but if i did it would be on anyone that has ever tweeted someone this aged well
TheKostos,red zone just showed three  field goal  attempts in a row and all three went the opposite of what i needed lol god take the wheel
TheKostos,psg beat dortmund 2-0 and advance to the next round on 3-2 aggregate. have to think not playing in front of their jaded fanbase helped lol
TheKostos,"thank you for the texas tech winner 

3-1 day today for me. 

 nailed his best bet blazers/magic over. 

were back at it tomorrow  

#powerhour 6-7pm et."
TheKostos,i saw man. i feel terrible. people close to me have gone through it. i hope he gets well and finds peace and is back soon
TheKostos,chelsea gotta start thinking about the second leg here they go down 3-0 and  it is  dunzo zero chance they go to munich and slam bayern
TheKostos,tonight's college card is gross and some numbers have already gotten away from what i was originally looking at. hopefully his eminence  will have some winners
TheKostos,packers now get the winner of seahawks/eagles and will be favored as opposed to hosting the saints and being a dog. vikings go to san fran
TheKostos,2007 jags would have won that game 0 out of 10 times... and also shouldnt have beaten the steelers (although im guessing you already know that)
LockyLockerson,"daily fantasy sports  worry utah can come back against a great opponent just like they did against...

...

oh wait they never played anyone very good"
LockyLockerson,not really havent put a lot of thought into the nfl with no shows and the busy holiday weekend. organs safely in the body for now.
LockyLockerson,very busy night in the nba most of the league in action.  my afternoon updated thoughts on all the games now up at the patreon page!
LockyLockerson,"the ""carmelo is a complete disaster"" angle eluded me in the game and  that is  entirely my fault.  was staring all of us in the face."
LockyLockerson,"lungs gone other organs remain and of course i got an extra appendix for the 4pm games.  with my last breath i uttered: ""fuuuuuck you vinatieriiiiii"""
LockyLockerson,i have never written down so many big favorites on a single saturday in my entire life.  what is happening.  down is up.  left is right.
LockyLockerson,"no i'm saying none of them really matter to this game specifically.  so in a way yes they are on the same level as ""not mattering"""
LockyLockerson,my guess is they are completely full of shit but hey what do i know maybe 10 or fewer preseason games is enough to draw conclusions
LockyLockerson,all of this is actually pretty harmless fun  college football  banter in general but just dont ever bet based on any of this type of stuff...ever.
LockyLockerson,since 1990 the coach of the year winner won double-digit games the year before just four times (out of 28 seasons).  colts were 10-6 last year.
LockyLockerson,please dont get mad about who won the espy for something.  its an espy.  quick who won any espy ever in any year before this year?
LockyLockerson,we are firmly in that time of year where these endgames will drive to you an early grave.  across the board just wild shit from 18-year-olds.
EliHershkovich,". priced the packers' super bowl futures at 14-1 in april (cc:

DannyParkins,preston  zadarius smith lead any nfl duo for qb hits. kenny clark and jaire alexander are excellent. i think their defense is more than good enough.
DannyParkins,about to talk to  his appearances have been great. then we've got  scheduled for 5pm. we're rolling on a bears monday and you can listen here:
DannyParkins,here's the thing mitch looked worse in many ways than last year and that should be impossible. try not to panic over a half of football.
DannyParkins,warriors cant ask for two better looks than that given the situation. the 2nd round of the nba playoffs continue to be nothing short of fantastic.
DannyParkins,psa if you wanna avoid pregame and are getting anxious for kickoff episode 3 of this season of curb your enthusiasm is already available on demand/hbogo
DannyParkins,first show of the day:  with    we all have chiefs futures. joe hit 66:1 last night.  let us  make some money today. tune in on  or
chadmillman,not looking. one game one pick. ive been told unfortunately that we have a shot to finish in the money. but i dont want to discuss!!!!
chadmillman,a juicy prime-time matchup with competing narratives (russ is great in prime-time; kirk is the worst in prime-time) and a point-spread full of opportunity (i think).
chadmillman,everyone says nfl preseason week 3 is most important. bettors agree? plus  goes deep on  college football  ap top 25  where betting nuggets are in rankings.
chadmillman,i was in the bathroom just off camera borrowing the really nice disposable hand towels with the seal until it was time for the group pic.
chadmillman,it is  back! the get your prop up in vegas contest. who will be immortalized with their prop on the board at a vegas sports book?
chadmillman,hoping the fact we made everything  free today will put us all in a better place as we get over  college football  reg season being over.
chadmillman,much as i hate to self promote (its a joke people) listen to  and me  turn into felix and oscar (old person reference) in real time.
chadmillman,"me: ""son i know you love uconn but runs like this are why u need to consider the emotional hedge as an option."" him: ""you're weird."""
chadmillman,. still has michigan at 20-1 to win  college basketball  title. odds for other no 1 seed faves: l'ville 10-1 wichst 12-1 zona 7-1 florida 4-1.
chadmillman,one time offer. you got it.   friendly side bet on jags pick? if titans cover i get free  sub? i lose i buy a year sub?
Gingfacekillah,if you want to see a sample of the r code that is going to be inside i found this .pdf version of the supplementary materials:
Gingfacekillah,if you've enjoyed the book please consider leaving a review on amazon so that individuals like this  daily fantasy sports  get to have the last word.
Gingfacekillah,unfortunately amazon only lets me run a pre-order for the kindle edition. the paperback edition will be available when the book is officially released in august.
Gingfacekillah,mets braves padres dodgers.3-1 0.86u. heavy chalk but projected edges are projected edges. nice to have a winning day after a few days of bankroll churning.
Gingfacekillah,id never knock excel: its my starting workshop for all models. once you get good with it you can do a surprising amount of modelling work.
Gingfacekillah,oh im sure youre right. thats just my reference for when i noticed they started playing like trash. ive avoided them since then for forecasting games.
Gingfacekillah,its a legit possibility. i suppose the optimistic view is that the less sharp/square 97 percent  keep the market from ever reaching that height of efficiency.
Gingfacekillah,very much appreciated. i may have a question or two once i'm up and running but i'll see how far i can get grinding it out.
Gingfacekillah,thats the real challenge. how does one camouflage an +ev betting profile? keep it within standard deviation of chance? mix in negative positive expected value plays?
Gingfacekillah,from your perspective does a house liability side arise naturally through betting action or is it an active process where the house is taking a position?
logan_matthews9,xg is the standard at this point i agree. but until you can quantify the sport on a player level it will continue to lag behind
logan_matthews9,took lsu/under to finish tied for 9th. thanks  and  for running it - gave me constant rooting interests without huge overhead in a high variance market
PikachuBets,yeah op i agree the 2019 football team includes no parts of the 2016-19 football teams. was a hella busy recruiting season for orgeron from scratch
PikachuBets,he blocked me so i couldnt. but he should flip through the other sheets i got and at least my record is still public unlike his
PikachuBets,housing costs take up a larger percentage of income for todays workforce than they have in previous generations. look it up lots of data out there
adamchernoff,might actually increase the overall quality of the videos i am trying to produce. could introduce things like reverse line movement to hell fire and brimstone...
Ccon8181,jamis strikes again!!! throws pick 6 in overtime to hit the over 48.5. just amazing! congrats to those of you on the jamis over train #atlvstb
Ccon8181,yea. then go prevent on last drive let ok state go right down the field for a touchdown after shutting them out on 2nd half. smh
Ccon8181,i love this take jason! 100 percent  agree... then let them play every time. not call 15 yard penalties for landing on qb for a sack.
Ccon8181,#virginiacavaliers up 10 with 3 plus minutes to go. built to sustain leads choked it away. then to win it at free throw line just garbage.
Ccon8181,props to  for his mention of #miami lykes last two free throw covering the spread of -7.5 haha. announcers/hosts should be aware of the spread imo
Ccon8181,long way too go. you know how these  college basketball  games go. the first half ended with a half court banked in three so well see.
Ccon8181,hope youre right but trap line would be -7 imo .. more then full game spread. ppl must be lined up to take warriors 2nd half

kellyinvegas,ill get it from  but since the pat was moved back thats just the truth. small sample or not thats how the game is currently played.
kellyinvegas,i will not laugh if it happens to me again this weekend. i cant have back to back implosions. need a few weeks in between them.
ToddFuhrman,exactly you figured me out.  here i was thinking i was keeping my disdain for all grandfathers under wraps but i let it slip this morning
ToddFuhrman,there may not be a city or fan base that has more unrealistic expectations for  it is  team than toronto does for its beloved maple leafs
ToddFuhrman,"one has to wonder how many more games we'll see mark dantonio coach in east lansing.

ToddFuhrman,your boss is a smart man (although i see no correlation either) but id be happy to send him my resume for additional part time work
ToddFuhrman,you have to love coach leach; very few coaches are this laid back while basically calling out his entire team and referring to ucla as dormant
ToddFuhrman,scotty that was going to be too easy; we have to avoid predictability on the podcast or you guys will stop tuning in for each show!
ToddFuhrman,going to be disappointed if kawhi heads back to toronto because fading the lakers all next season wont be as profitable as it could have been

ToddFuhrman,sounds like an overly liberal mindset! ha.  should we be buying 49ers stock this year?  i know you need that playoff optimism back in the column...
ToddFuhrman,all about the build but no doubt a challenge to recreate a new rivalry on the same level of bobby and chuck after they joined forces
ToddFuhrman,he can control the pace and tempo they played with going away from what worked getting easy buckets instead trying to burn the clock each possession
TheCousinSal,prediction: sometime in the next 10 minutes julie ertz will sneak one by brienne of tarth and the u.s. will hold on to win 1-nil. #uswnt
TheCousinSal,breaking: bobby bonilla has decided to forego the remainder of his contract so as to not have to be associated with the mets once a year.
TheCousinSal,remember the days when the only leaks the raiders had to worry about were the ones al davis took in his parachute pants while napping? sad.
TheCousinSal,a shrimp-eating contest (which i won by the way) at the #mgmgrand during the ncaa tournament is nothing short of a dream come true. #lockitin #marchmadness
TheCousinSal,is coming to the   next week. click this link to get tickets and see us live. or just watch on tv. i really couldnt care less.
TheCousinSal,the cowboys are dying to choke this game and division away. luckily they have the best coach in the business to help chase down this goal.
TheCousinSal,i feel bad for   so much so that i might buy him a vitamix or something with all the loot i win off the  tonight.  #jinx
TheCousinSal,congrats to  and his foreign object on a well-deserved victory. im not saying betting on wwe is fishy - but the favorites went 10-0 tonight at
TheCousinSal,this beautiful bastard turns 47 (no im serious...only 47) today. heres hoping he celebrates the occasion by hitting his first wnba parlay this decade. happy birthday

TheCousinSal,congrats  now do the right thing + honor bartman at the home games next week. even if you give him crappy seats far from the field.
TheCousinSal,reyes/bones jones is a really good one so far. so close after three rounds. definitely most significant strikes jones has endured from an opponent thus far.
12Xpert,remind me: how many matches had it been since #arsenal lost at home after leading at half time? illustrates  the scale of the problem facing #arteta
12Xpert,your and their obsession with identity politics is a breading ground for the sort of rubbish you and they espouse. history has defeated you. go away.
12Xpert,if there was anyway to measure this distribution of skill it would probably conform to a very strong power law something like this but much steeper.
12Xpert,could you just clear up what the yellow line actually is. is it expected profit based on your odds divided by closing odds with margin removed?
12Xpert,if you want to prove you cause things show your followers the closing prices alongside the prices you advise. that would be a start at least.
12Xpert,who knows with corbyn. he's used the same words to describe the media as donald trump. hardly a recipe for confidence in what he might do.
12Xpert,after all pinnacle's opening odds are pretty efficient on average and  daily fantasy sports  look a whole lot worse compared to closing odds in this chart.
12Xpert,a rationale bettor would never at a negative expected value bet unless he was just doing it for a laugh. 1000 euro is not for laughs.
mschwimer,"""because thats the way we have always done it."" aka the legit worst excuse imaginable.  legit no logical reason for them to do it that way."
mschwimer,another big win for the pigs... 4-1 to start the year... we have won by 311 and 1 runs in each of the games. #goodbullpen #timelyhitting
mschwimer,i had a side bet with a teammate that stutes would have 1000 followers by the days end... if u love the phillies u will follow
RufusPeabody,if you'd like to talk to me about it please shoot me a dm. i want to get as many different perspectives as i can.
RufusPeabody,great podcast   got me thinking how does the difficulty of qbs improving accuracy compare to basketball players improving shooting ability or baseball pitchers improving control?
RufusPeabody,market does not like my kansas state side. if i didn't already have a 'full' position on it i'd probably add a bit at -4.5.
RufusPeabody,yep. though the way i'm doing it i'm getting both value based on market moving my way and value based on line shopping in it.
RufusPeabody,you could fake it till you make it. the lines between charm vision bullsh*t and fraud have become so narrow as to be one line.
RufusPeabody,people are literally paying for picks with no idea if the pick seller is a long term winner. or even medium term for that matter.
RufusPeabody,you are completely missing my point!! i do not buy picks from either of them personally. and i'm in the business of maximizing my profits.
RufusPeabody,in my opinion  it is  easier to make money by finding an edge researching and modeling yourself than it is to make money buying picks.
RufusPeabody,the super bowl is one of the only events where public money is driving the line. (world cup also) you are cherrypicking a few events.
RufusPeabody,im not hedging my titans futures with money but i am hedging with time  all my advance super bowl prop research presumes a chiefs win.
RufusPeabody,i thought this one is pretty simple. much more intuitive than a team down 14 scoring a  touchdown  and going for two in the 4q.
jeffma,i give plusev my proxy vote.  can i send him your phone number and he can do the call  and back and forth with you?
jeffma,yes. for sure. but its kind of a vanilla story in business. for people who follow sports the idea of pitching chapman in game 6...
jeffma,"c'mon man. you are the ""fixing expert""... you  daily fantasy sports  fix a game by losing by over 20 points when you are a favorite"
jeffma,i think squib is fine. worst thing they field it with a knee on the ground and get another play from wherever they fielded it
jeffma,"it is  sad that you provided a hot take and  daily fantasy sports  provide any color for your opinion. just that ""you played the game"""
jeffma,"this is what the nba is really like. what the warriors did this season previous to this ""slump"" was next level. they will be fine."
jeffma,1st world problem of the day: headed to a's/sox tonight but want to watch w's game also. anywhere in/near coliseum that will have w's game?
SportsCheetah,impromptu dinner on me tonight at pizzeria mozza ~6:30 for anybody in the los angeles area that wants to sweat usc-iowa points from our phones.
SportsCheetah,someone in the crowd had to have had lmu +pts or  field goal /2h unders  lets find them. lmu was up 18 by the way
SportsCheetah,you now i'm all up on 76ers this season. just let me know when to buy the tickets in la against the clippers on 3/1.
SportsCheetah,yup its useful for bettors but it also helps the average fan gauge what they are watching in a way beyond just the actual score.
capjack2000,conveniently days after the super bowl. if it is another patriots victory rhode island might be begging for enough runway to get back to even.
capjack2000,yikes. its going to be hard to remember these episodes just based on title and snen. and im someone who rewatches random episodes when bored.
capjack2000,"significant because its the first example of class i gaming ive seen in a long time. 

class i gaming is traditional primitive indian tribal games."
capjack2000,good article here by  on an issue that i think keeps getting more important as more states come online. granular self-exclusion is important and necessary.
capjack2000,"hopefully people  daily fantasy sports  confuse score gaming and scores casino. 

the latter is a legal online casino in nj based on a strip club."
capjack2000,funny you bring that up.  (which operates ) is the only affiliate in nj that has been licensed to receive a share of players losses.
capjack2000,"if i could change one thing about the nj regs it would be this. one-sided props are unfair to the consumer. 

the antithesis of bookmaking."
capjack2000,looks like the new  has a twitter feed right up on the odds board. if only  was around to see this... rip mayor of #gamblingtwitter
capjack2000,when you vlog into a camera in your lap while driving (in vegas of all places) you are definitely testing that theory of free will.
capjack2000,"especially futures that wont resolve for another 326 days! 

next thing we know dk will be offering props like will the earth end before 2119?"
capjack2000,the movement on black panther from +2400 to +700 back to +2100 and back to +700 all during the broadcast has been the bigger story.
capjack2000,i agree. i guess this chart comes to us from the future. technically you can bet via mobile apps in ms now...just restricted to on-property.
capjack2000,not yet! thats the point though. theres room for evolution of this product and we should be open to change; not pessimistic of its prospects.
dinkinc,our president is so dumb...... how dumb is he ?...... he brought a gun to the golf course because he wanted to shoot a birdie
dinkinc,the winner of that would have a tough go in the finals...i think round 2 and then a quick win in round 3 for brody
dinkinc,i was truly amazed how much i liked it....  i thought i would get somewhat bored but instead it kept getting better with each match
dinkinc,this is what you give obama credit for ? you bash everything else he ever did.  of course you are abusing the truth once again
dinkinc,three days in chicago....  friday cubs .... saturday ufc..... sunday double header arlington and hawthorne ....  hoping to spend a little time with  as well
dinkinc,in the past and future week i have or will be hanging with           and  .. some of the best people at what they do.. #fortunatelife
robpizzola,i  daily fantasy sports  have the qualifications that would be necessary for a role like that but strongly believe that i could do the job.
robpizzola,you should think that way because there is an incredible amount of random variance when we are only looking at a 16 game sample size.
robpizzola,ok but they both affect the outcome of a game. punting on 4th  2 from an opponent's 40 reduces your win expectancy. this isn't difficult.
robpizzola,post a video in the next five minutes. shouldn't be that hard since you are online responding to every one of my tweets right now.
robpizzola,exactly! that scene was just horrible. one of the worst i can remember in a while and is why i felt this episode was unsatisfying.
robpizzola,virginia duke and unc have all seen their probabilities drop from my pre-tournament numbers because of so many higher-seeded teams advancing from the opening weekend.
RASPicks,"ras free plays thread: 

will likely be very low volume. plays also posted here simultaneously if  daily fantasy sports  want to subscribe to thread alerts."
RASPicks,exactly. in reality no one is betting 3-5x their normal unit size or  percent  of bankroll on plays rated 3-5 units.  at least i hope.
VegasRefund,eh id say both cals qbs were half decent and tcus defense made them look worse than they actually are. tcus qb is just bad.
VegasRefund,maction starts next week. which means today is the last day we will not have any football for a long time. thank you football gods.
VegasRefund,i dont buy it.. why put extra miles on him when youre 10.5 game up and he was clearly burnt during the playoffs last year.
ProfessorShine,about to compliment herm than i saw the 3rd and 5 play to setup a punt to net themselves 19 yards.  burned only 14 seconds
ProfessorShine,when u have a league without ridiculous guaranteed contracts guys play for their spots regardless of teams record.  one of good things in the nfl
ProfessorShine,overall i dont want to see top 2 teams have to play an extra game.   this current invitational format via committee is shit on rye.
ProfessorShine,"also *plain and simple.  typo on main tweet.
i could dig deeper but im not in love with many top tier coaches not named bennet"
ProfessorShine,beer in a cup.  also was some dumbass rule no gambling could exist within like 30yards of casino entrance. cant make this dumb shit up
ProfessorShine,2:57 simmons give ball up at key goes down low ball goes to right wing to embiid simmons doesnt even try to post.   embiid stuck.
ProfessorShine,imagine that in 1985 the opening game of the tournament between defending champ g-town and lehigh was played at 10am and wasnt even on espn.
ProfessorShine,you mean bad job for gold sheet every year.  apparently  and that sam guy from  think hes good for radio but he has no edge
suuma810,ok but my question is: is that a recognition thing play-call thing or aren't they allowed to adjust their route against this kind of coverage?
suuma810,damit schadet sich rosen doch nur selbst. die cards haben keine nte ihn unter wert zu traden. im schlechtesten fall ist er ein preiswerter backup.
suuma810,the #chiefs offense is at 40.8 percent  dvoa.  that is  only 2.7 percent  lower than the 2007 #patriots. kc's pass dvoa is 7 percent  higher.
suuma810,i know its a road fav but fading the browns on a 6-point teaser has resulted in a teaser leg record of 37-1-2 since 2016.
suuma810,so the #packers just got a tie instead of a win because of a rule that isnt executed the same way as in week two.
suuma810,"no play today 

would lean falcons at +3 but value obviously gone completely. very strong move from +4 a couple weeks ago to pk now."
ClevTA,facemask against allen on the 4th and 1 on the last drive. was an easy 15 yards. dont get me wrong it wasnt the difference
ClevTA,so 45 yd  field goal s are automatic? and best case is u still need a  touchdown  and a 2 after making multiple stops? ok
ClevTA,some halftime reading. nfl against the spread picks. at this point my thursday night picks are probably the only ones worth paying attention to apparently
ClevTA,yeah im ok with one hailmary compared to a 1-1 situation. its a totally diff defensive look when u know theres only one play left
ClevTA,this indicates that they wouldve gone for two if they had a chance to win the gm at the end. its essentially the same thing
ClevTA,bc a bunch had asked. from tuesday. this was in reference to eagles and browns spreads. thought those were the farthest off my personal numbers
ClevTA,whats worse is i could understand somewhat of using more 11 if u have huggins but without him why are u forcing someone like ratley?

spanky,i agree on a practical level but this would make for very boring radio that would get old after one episode.   does his thing well.
spanky,this is a circled overnight limit. while i still think its way too low they may do this instead of take the game down completely
spanky,all good bro... if i misled anyone i apologize.  i share some knowledge and instead of being thanked i'm classified as misleading.... only on twitter...
spanky,exactly. then you have the guy thats a table player who gets 20k on the game bet the other side.  its so easy its pathetic.

DocBettor,this was the equivalent to full game -11 when the live line was -14 so even though it lost i would take it every time

PlusEVAnalytics,pinnacle has dak rushing yards at 12.5 chi tt 20.5 zeke 83.5 yards and +108  touchdown . this bet should come with a free lobotomy.

PlusEVAnalytics,sorry youll be disappointed we didnt actually discuss 70s rock bands on the pod. im just laying out the ground rules for my new  followers.
PlusEVAnalytics,you and  have very different opinions about how much can be learned from one game! imo the truth lies somewhere in the middle...yay parameter uncertainty!
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah i find it hard to buy that. if you can predict future line movement that accurately you should be making bets not taking them.
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont know what the answer is (i know what i think it should be...) so anyone who has real numbers feel free to share
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont know any number i throw out there would be a wild guess but 65-70 percent  win prob vs toronto 60-65 percent  vs mil
PlusEVAnalytics,yes from my reading of the article that appears to be what happened. they are booking outside of the parimutuel pool but capping the odds.
PlusEVAnalytics,there must be a lot of insecurity behind this internet tough guy persona. i hope you find whatever it is youre looking for in life.
aluckyaday,it would probably happen most around key numbers as well where the public have less understanding of how much the extra half point is worth.
aluckyaday,did they overrun the farage interview a bit so all those turning over at the end of emmerdale to watch eastenders got to see it?
aluckyaday,i would be very surprised if you can create anything more than natural growth in liquidity in a market that is in essence zero sum.
aluckyaday,i'm no expert either but these european soft books are! marketing is their business. as paris smith put it they are marketing companies not bookmakers!
aluckyaday,yes tipsters move prices. but even they are bringing information to the market. you really believe opening cycling prices are more efficient than closing ones?

do you like betting in-play?

EdMillerPoker,then you should check out our website  all day as we make halftime lines for every game and in-play lines for a lot of them
EdMillerPoker,they have their flaws and i certainly would not use them for betting. theyre good for kinda that fan experience as you watch a game.
EdMillerPoker,"if he didn't get paid ""what would they have to pay you to retire and go do something else?"" money then he screwed up imo"

LeeSharpeNFL,normally i'd say bears should go for 2 after the penalty but 4 vs. 5 points is worth very little. still kick the extra point.
LeeSharpeNFL,apparently the browns traded blough  to the lions in exchange for a swap of 7th round picks in the 2022 draft. he must be incredible.

whale_capper,"oh man... so many thoughts (rockets were +260 to win the series this morning fyi  it is  not like the market thinks ""they got this"")"
AndyMSFW,it was harsh enough that christmas was canceled at my house but understandable considering you'd only had 24 hours to recover from sunday night football.
AndyMSFW,betonline opens these bookmaker isn't too far behind and then most of the other offshores have them up by evening.  what sites are you using?
AndyMSFW,this is like the end of the great white hype where damon wayans remembers that he's way better at boxing than the white guy. #bigtenchampionship
AndyMSFW,agreed on being a great gift idea!  got copies for my lawyer my ex-wife and my neighbor that never returns my tools!  tis the season!!!!
AndyMSFW,oh snap i like that a ton as well.  going to have to migrate over to bovada more they have 110 markets on this match.
AndyMSFW,"good job montana  prairie view!
good effort umbc.

5 more teams in the finals to go:
new mexico state

AndyMSFW,"the funniest thing happened i went to check on additional lines for tomorrow and there are lines up for thursday already.   so...

east carolina +10.5"
JoeyKnish22,tell him uncle k said he cant wait to see wilder knock his racist ass the fuck out. (then run as fast as you can)
JoeyKnish22,it definitely had to have by the house language. without that i doubt any pay out cause the senate is obviously not confirming the impeachment.
JoeyKnish22,working on getting some from the guy hes out of most sizes said hell put in a special order for me will let ya know.
JoeyKnish22,well when memphis win the national title i think  is gonna be able to retire and unfortunately youll probably have to hear a lot more
JoeyKnish22,"i dont know whose idea it was to tee up pizzola right before me so im not gonna overreact. 

but i want them fired immediately."
JoeyKnish22,im not an oddsmaker bob im mostly here for a few cheap trolling laughs and to pay for the matts bonuses with some losing wagers.
JoeyKnish22,got a lot of great response to this (more than i was expecting) thank you. if you sent me a dm ill get to it.
JoeyKnish22,could you ask jeff how much liability he has on 49ers to win the nfc west division and if hes fired that employee yet? thanks!
JoeyKnish22,telegraphing youre going to snap the ball to a rb in a wildcat formation hasnt worked in ten years and teams are still running in.
JoeyKnish22,could go 6 but 11 is key and ties reduce also im not betting a lot of money on this even tho its gorgeous artwork.
JoeyKnish22,just worked out ravens got the combo of competitive expected road loss to elite team + 3 division losses + really poor perf from browns/steelers.
JoeyKnish22,been ongoing arguments over the fee. la liga threatening to block it. likely gets resolved since hes already with barca. but just something to monitor.
JoeyKnish22,lotta people saying the franchise has lost it. too old washed. a cff has-been. i would never say that obviously but other less professional people.
JoeyKnish22,lol honestly. i dont know. theres so much misinformation out there. gun to my head he goes back to toronto. but nothing would surprise me.
TheKostos,how tf does wisconsin not have taylor just take oregon's soul. so bad. i bet on oregon so i love it but i mean yikes
TheKostos,rusev getting no reaction was the death blow. and liv's part should have gotten a much bigger reaction if not for her horribly slow/unconvincing delivery
TheKostos,deandre baker watching perkins catch the  touchdown  and then michael thomas watching goedert haul in the 3rd down pass. two losers in the giants secondary
TheKostos,hilarious sequence for colts bettors. brissett misses a wide open pascal punt downed at the 2 wiped out by penalty and then punt block. lol
TheKostos,might debut the man bun in an ig story. will first need to consult my gf to see if thats potential grounds for breakup though
TheKostos,there has never been bigger pi than there just was in the niners/saints game. i mean  what the fuck . this league is a joke
TheKostos,it was a good spot to theoretically buy very low on the rams and sell very high on the ravens. didnt work out. it happens
TheKostos,i bet yale +5 and they just sent it to overtime on a late three. 100 percent  not covering and i'm going to be apoplectic
TheKostos,kelly is a tremendous talent a great capper and a dope-ass person and she gets way too much unnecessary shit from dumbass trolls. be better
TheKostos,liverpool 2-0 now but the tie is far from over. atletico go through on a 2-1 loss on away goals. wild ending still to come
TheKostos,"#nbanick's nba picks to come later. 

in the meantime  let us  play some early  college basketball .

tennessee +2.5
west virginia -1
texas tech +3"
TheKostos,in a lifetime of legendary performances by michael jordan today's ranks near the very top. and the most human i can ever remember seeing him
TheKostos,losers in life will hate on literally anything or anyone to make themselves feel better about their miserable existences. you morons know who you are
LockyLockerson,full saturday nba final thoughts (to go with the overnight model projections) now up for patreon subscribers.  a very tricky saturday to try to navigate.
LockyLockerson,i guess temple a little at 11.5 but  that is  about it.  first game nothing.  waste would be a good word with these 2 games.
LockyLockerson,"pumped for the show tonight!

equal parts looking back and forward.  

equal parts sweating monday night and trying to relax after a weekend of craziness."
LockyLockerson,ok so that was a pretty wild day considering the lack of high profile matchups.  woo football! cant wait to sweat more for 3 months.
LockyLockerson,"ohhhhhhh it looks like they just copied their ""scores first"" prices over to that market by mistake.  what fun.  tony rolling over in his grave."
LockyLockerson,you can win now  it is  just way more difficult.  and it can't be solved by adding up w's and l's on a schedule printout.
LockyLockerson,"greyworm: we rule the city now we wont give an inch 

greyworm 5 seconds later: just kidding yall let me know about that new king"
LockyLockerson,yep! and i  daily fantasy sports  even love avengers that much but it had been too long since i'd been to a movie. feels good.
LockyLockerson,more people than i expected and want to basically have their own ncaa tournament.  i will help them do so and tonight well have ours.
LockyLockerson,also thanks to the bucks for making the day where i was paying the least attention to the nba into one of the most profitable
LockyLockerson,is this what  it is  like every night to bet against the bulls?  this is the most fun i've had in weeks in the nba.

DannyParkins,in fairness one of those int was last pass heave at end of the half but travis etienne definitely had the better heisman campaign game
DannyParkins,this is the most wide open the nba has been heading into a season since the pistons won it with chauncey rip ben and sheed.
DannyParkins,now let me be clear: i dont think hell win the award. far from it. but marcus mariota cant be 100:1 with mitch at 200:1.
DannyParkins,we're gonna have jed hoyer  right at 2:00. we'll talk about david ortiz intentionally hitting batters his bulllpen and a big series against the dodgers.
DannyParkins,get ready for an onslaught of gronk in your pop culture lives as he reportedly is gonna try to be the next stallone or arnold
DannyParkins,i feel like  it is  worth pointing out that taysom hill is 29 years old and he has 15 total pass attempts in the nfl.
DannyParkins,jeff goodman floated mark bartlestein's name as someone who could run the bulls. he's a super agent with chicago ties. mark's about to call into

Gingfacekillah,thanks! both volumes are available in kindle ebook format. you can get a free kindle reader app for your phone pc mac etc as well.
Gingfacekillah,nice to get a first look at deeeeeetroit basketball. will be interesting to see how coach casey's swing/wing 3 ball offense schemes play out here.
Gingfacekillah,"looks ugly today....headed for 1-3. we'll see if the nym pull off the upset either way back at it tomorrow. 

tentatively 20-18-2 y touchdown ."
Gingfacekillah,one contrarian take is that we might welcome square money with its irrational overconfidence and lack of calculation to a zero sum game. caveat emptor.
Gingfacekillah,i actually find the glare of bright/white screens is hard on my eyes. i find the dark theme easier for long hours of work personally.
Gingfacekillah,on page 3 another method to estimate bookmaker margin and no-vig probability. thought you might find it interesting /complimentary to your true odds spreadsheet work:
logan_matthews9,big fan of the liga mx stans chirping about my lafc take while cruz azul is simultaneously down 1-0 to a semi pro jamaican side
logan_matthews9,love you guys but ill never understand why a coding position is force to be in-house other than limiting your applicant pool by 90 percent
logan_matthews9,i like a handful of these plays but a lot seem too heavily weighted towards week one. how much is last week impacting your model?
logan_matthews9,hey alex - if you dont mind me asking where are you getting your data for loi? never seen anything on the league readily available
PikachuBets,"get a clue guy lmao next are you gonna tell us how 5d and heritage are ""shaping the industry"" with their low juice offerings? jesus"

PikachuBets,would be nice if your players played some defense pls.  post game has been eating your big men alive all game come on now jeez

adamchernoff,how much do you devalue the kc win vs bal earlier in the year where they put up 33 and 500+ yards in three quarters?
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  consider 760 yards in regulation and just shy of 6.0 combined ypp resulting in more than 43 points lucky or unusual.
adamchernoff,yes. football at the moment. basketball afterward. but the discussion is always open to all sports. there was some boxing in there too this morning.
adamchernoff,thanks chris. glad to hear youre taking more than just the picks away from the blog each week. thanks for taking the time to read!
Ccon8181,new year same harbaugh and #michiganfootball ... settle for  field goal s and getting dominated in a bowl game. same shit. another fraud team #citrusbowl
Ccon8181,damn! they will stick with you for sure. mine was ne atl super bowl. brother showed up to my place at halftime. same thing haha
Ccon8181,relax buddy. i didnt bet the game. just pointing out i perceived the line   to be off. no dog in the fight = no side.
Ccon8181,this is how we lost #bearsvsgiants -6 .. besides the missed xp  what was 39 doing? almost but not quite as bad as ucf yesterday
Ccon8181,did you see him on az following possession trying to spot the ball after rb was tackled on screen? 3 yards off. had no clue
Ccon8181,ive been looking at a third party tracking site. can the user alter their risk/side/number after theyve submitted a side? can you select 2nd halfs?
Ccon8181,id take an ugly looking sportsbook that takes big limits over the mega tvs sportsbetting experience books in vegas who wont take a 5k wager.
Ccon8181,"this could be ugly well see if louisville puts in the effort 
sportsbetting fund 

 investment  

#louisville +2 -110 2nd half risking 5.5 percent 

 selective sides"
Ccon8181,they could always switch it around but the lack of energy effort plus the line move makes me really doubt the side. hope im wrong
Ccon8181,happens all the time. hardest part is trying to explain to your girl why your all of a sudden rooting for the other team haha
Ccon8181,damn... harden gets me again. dude wants no part of this game and wants the rest of the night off. loser out the gate. brutal
Ccon8181,due to requests. this year ill post all wagers prior to kickoff so those wanting to tail can do so. lets have a solid season.
Ccon8181,#wakeforest got blitzed... done. dont want to be there. dont have to seeat it out. chalk it up as an l. on to the next
Ccon8181,fuck the #browns !!! hc jackson and kizer! fing lames and f me for backing them! smh  damn that would have been huge. instead brutal!
Ccon8181,hard to get going today after last nights extreme bad beat on #redskins ... but gotta keep pushing gym time. then on to the next.
Ccon8181,a little of both imo. the oddsmakers didn't inflate the over under that much despite consistent o. but favs continued to cash vs inflated lines
Ccon8181,it was a rip move and looked worse bc harrison slipped.steelers line had 0 holds all game? let them play all game can't call that
Ccon8181,it is  bad when you have to call timeouts to keep the refs from point shaving. no lead is safe in this one. #uscvspsu #rosebowl
Ccon8181,"contrarian investments llc is invested in

#titans -1.5 -110 risking 1.9 percent  -most i could risk before # moved

#bills +2.5 +105 
#jags +3 +105"
Ccon8181,you call it more hype the reality  tell that to the investors who have profited 68.97 percent  y touchdown .  that is  real $ produced
Ccon8181,maybe i couldn't get the number i need at cg but can at another book. lower risk for the fund is better for investors imo.
Ccon8181,when an  college football  team is in field goal range to win and the qb throws a pic. this doc shows why. they recruit potentialproduction
Ccon8181,irving  curry ... not only does irving play d...curry got jealous thompson had it going and shot the #warriors out of it in the 3rd.
Ccon8181,watched those non calls at very end of #okcvsdal game.two straight fouls not called before #mavs call it off.big ouch if you had okc -14.5
Ccon8181,despite #nova winning i hate them for not fouling up 3 with 5 seconds left screwing the under. fitting end to the season 1-1 night
kellyinvegas,i dont have a bias against any teams. ive said this 100 times. i dont care about the names on the jersey. im betting numbers.
kellyinvegas,a hobby turned into a career. didnt fully plan this. yet its something i always wanted. a lot of luck and hard work sure helped.
kellyinvegas,lmao. get over yourself. a) its the third quarter. b) ive had a great nfl season. anytime you are welcome to go h2h against me.

nfl:

ToddFuhrman,ha i still think we see him on the roster at that point. might need to get the folks  to hang a number for you
ToddFuhrman,weirdly captivated by a tremendous exhibition game between  and team australia.  the fact there are 52k+ fans in attendance in melbourne for it is incredible
ToddFuhrman,big announcement coming soon my friend. maybe amir is a fan of the podcast too and thats how he shows his frustration during the off-season
ToddFuhrman,"where will  play his 1st regular season game of 2019?

rockets +100
76ers +150
nets +800
clippers +800
knicks +900
lakers +1000

(odds via  )"
ToddFuhrman,the basketball gods have been very good to us so far with 3 hotly contested drama filled and well played elite 8 games so far
ToddFuhrman,knowing when to pass on games is as valuable a skill for bettors as recognizing when to take a stronger position on a particular game
TheCousinSal,"on an all-new #againstallodds podcast the degen trifecta  i break down..
-dal/chi
-sf/no
-buf/balt
-kc/ne
-sea/lar
-ncaa title games 
-joshua/ruiz
- best sports tshirts 
-sharptank"
TheCousinSal,that was the craziest knockout ive ever seen in my entire life. thoughts and prayers to ben askrens next next next next of kin. #ufc239
TheCousinSal,people get on the warriors case but this is exactly why every team needs to load up with 11 all-stars...just in case 2 cant play.
TheCousinSal,i have to say ive been very impressed with the officiating at #wrestlemania35. the ncaa hoops refs should take a page out of the  book.
TheCousinSal,the 3rd and 15 conversion was huge for the chargers. it appears as if they wont be pushed around offensively like the colts were yesterday.
TheCousinSal,i made a bet that my very funny co-host  would lose her very crazy mind under 8.5 weeks into the program. another winner for me.
TheCousinSal,big ben - questionable to play - has thrown 35 passes in the first half.  steelers now tied were +650 about 30 minutes ago. #moneygrab
TheCousinSal,celtics fans are stunned - but they should really be happy that their team now has a chance to cover the spread. #priorities #gambling #laying4
TheCousinSal,if you care to find out who is winning this weekend's nfl playoff games and what my fat head looks like in cartoon form...watch this!
TheCousinSal,im not as sure that nate sudfeld can bring the eagles a super bowl championship as i was when i woke up this morning. #cowboysvseagles
TheCousinSal,so happy for the pats and their fans. they were due for some goal line luck. something like this could really turn their franchise around.
TheCousinSal,- your tar heels blew a 4th 1/4 lead costing me +  on a big parlay. we're shutting your mic for a week. harry's too.
TheCousinSal,will a pro athlete from one of the 4 major sports lose a thumb or a finger as a result of a fireworks accident tonight?
TheCousinSal,the yankees are being no-hit and are down 1-0 in the 1st inning. as far as i'm concerned everything else this season is gravy. #openingday
TheCousinSal,harrisonusually good for 8 to 10 points per game was swatted repeatedly today by  son. but dont worry...theres a plan in place for next week.
TheCousinSal,i wish i could just be 66 and have the ability to dunk and grow a full beard. is this how the game works   #giannismvp
12Xpert,that is true but on average i suspect you have +ev otherwise these soft books wouldn't be offering such loss leaders to attract new customers.
12Xpert,this could get interesting. really its not wise to mess with betsy andreu over doping in professional sport. shes always been on the right side.
12Xpert,"and you think the only people who use my data are tipsters?

and without softbook data i'd have no idea how pinnacle compares to them."
12Xpert,"reaching out to find out if  affiliate programme have ""forgotten"" to retag your pre- (november 2018) referrals and refuse to talk to you about it."
12Xpert,"have a read.

for sharp books like  there's a strong case for saying they are. i've not investigated whether this is true for softer books."
12Xpert,i can provide all communicatory evidence to back up what i've saying here. either the  affiliate team is completely incompetent or they are something worse.
JambosPicks,8/22 recap: jambos' 7 recommended plays went 2-4-1 and were -2.38 units bringing our cumulative record for the #mlb season to +46.89 units. #sportsgambling #gamblingtwitter
mschwimer,if i am as big a fool as is claimed then rufus should be able to destroy me in front on all his listeners right?
mschwimer,if you actually believe that then put your money where your mouth is. if your right you get 10k. if not you only lose 3k
mschwimer,you have personally witnessed  pick at 60 percent  over 150 games. and we give out all the picks for free to everyone. up 23.1 units!!!
mschwimer,i had the pleasure of meeting and working with  at the  incredible person and important voice for the game.  enjoy retirement and your next chapter!
mschwimer,the correct punishment.  why do you need to see a video to understand how horrific his actions were?  thats what i would ask the nfl
mschwimer,this  match has been insane.  its been 2 hours and we r on serve in the second set 3-2... som won the first set 7-6
RufusPeabody,"i  daily fantasy sports  even know what to say to this.

actual update: halfway through the 17-week package their picks have *lost* 4.61 units."
RufusPeabody,e-rep? nfl sides dont have huge edges. sure i could get down more on game day but edges are much smaller at that point.
RufusPeabody,if you have a good long-term record hell yes you are showing it. you are designing your whole site around making it super visible.
RufusPeabody,i was gonna say putting is the x-factor. chez and keego both not great putters but when the putter is working they are dangerous
RufusPeabody,i'm not accusing michael of doing things that hurt his subscribers; i'm just pointing out how his policies could be more transparent and consistent.
RufusPeabody,i am using an analogy to make a broader point. your comment is inane and doesn't address the point i'm making in this thread.
RufusPeabody,you  daily fantasy sports  need a monte carlo sim. you just need the binomial distribution which is what i was quoting numbers based on.
RufusPeabody,ed's been saying this was going to be a big deal for the last 6 weeks. most people are not taking this seriously enough.
RufusPeabody,thought my airpod mic was messed up but after angling it differently it turns out my scraggly beard was the cause of the problem.
RufusPeabody,based on what they did after the sbnc i doubt it. they didn't give me anything besides a 'we're sorry for the regrettable experience'
RufusPeabody,i know. and the more i learn about a lot of companies the more i realize many are missing the adults in the room.
RufusPeabody,i did not see every play. i signed up for your site back in march. that does not mean i was monitoring your plays.
jeffma,latest  episode where  has a stirring confession about his need to be loved or goes on and on about georgia. one of the two.
jeffma,having to listen to mark jackson tell us that nick nurse may be a better coach than he is is the definition of painful
jeffma,if any of you want to see my best attempt at restraint aka the gambling panel at the most recent #ssac19 here it is
jeffma,minimal contact compared to the previous play where your boys lost tatum under the hoop and he battled through it and made the layup.
jeffma,ha ha... yeah... we are going to clean it up and repost... but anything to make the bad jokes better is a good thing
jeffma,thanks man... i think  it is  13-2 (on supercontest picks) but hopefully we can keep it going... new podcast will be posted on thursday
jeffma,so based on all the markets you have seen what do you believe the true  percent  chance is of the warriors winning the title?
SportsCheetah,i mean its the 4 teams that had the best seasons and earned the spots no? otherwise whats the point of the sport lol
SportsCheetah,definitely but i'd still be surprised if zion wound up playing much more than half of the season.  it is  a ja fade imo.
SportsCheetah,haha didnt bet that one  for what  it is  worth  but would go that way if i had to. sixers winning the east btw.
SportsCheetah,which book would you like me to use because there are 9 i can bet at with 6.5 and even 1 with 6 -115
SportsCheetah,ill post the side id take for each game on the board in a few since theres a nice friday slate this time around
capjack2000,just about every nj book has made the mistake at some point. usually the first game of the season is when they slip up.
capjack2000,"3 = 5.5:1
4 = 10:1
5 = 19:1
6 = 39:1
7 = 74:1
8 = 149:1
9 = 374:1
10 = 799:1"
capjack2000,i know people limited to less than that on regular nba total lines at fanduel.  it is  the state of the industry these days.
capjack2000,keep in mind they collect state income tax from him on a win too. i'm sure his lawyers and accountants are aware of that.
capjack2000,"handle is the total amount wagered. 
revenue is (tickets written) - (tickets cashed) and is their gross gaming profit. 
hold percent  is the revenue/handle."
capjack2000,"best i've seen so far is a site still in development:


they are an affiliate site of course. i have no affiliation with them."
capjack2000,"i offered to wager $100k/month in dk's casino if they'd let me bet $1000 on sides and $500 on derivatives. 

they said no dice."
capjack2000,"thescore app...

...just kidding i'm not canadian. 

i use my donbest screen mostly. mlb atbat to jump between streams. espn for nba and nfl."
capjack2000,"nj sportsbetting handle for july was $251.4m.

i'm going to call this a win for crowdsourcing. 

 let us  move the dge to the blockchain!"
capjack2000,"ironic that the presser features a table and chairs since essentially mgm is letting a european company come in and eat their lunch. 

#jayrood"
capjack2000,yeaaaah....not for everyone...and not on everything. however  it is  easier to come back at cris with multiple accounts than it is a bm book.
capjack2000,"ocean resort casino...er...ocean casino resort sent me a survey today...this was their lead question. 

12 months? this sounds like a week in the life..."
capjack2000,exactly. do they cease and desist the offshore market or do they give up on the burgeoning us market? they cant play both sides.
dinkinc,in the last 13 games at least 2 hr's have been hit in milwaukee .... 8 of those games have gone under...baseball has changed
dinkinc,you do know that 4 of these problems are shared with every other country and one is all ours.... masa...   make america safe again
dinkinc,it got a little complicted when that other horse fouled him back in deep stretch but i agree with you just not as strongly...
dinkinc,the entire tiger lineup has players whose last names begin with the first ten letters of the alphabet ....  just wanted you to know
robpizzola,aside from that badly underthrown int i agree. its amazing what a clean pocket can do for a qb... lions have zero pass rush.
robpizzola,you can look at margin of victory and box score stats in those games---are they beating those teams by what is expected? overperforming? underperforming?
robpizzola,it is becoming the norm now. the free publicity that they are getting from every media outlet outweighs the cost in refunding the bets.
robpizzola,probably a bigger edge there but i can only bet a fraction of the money that i can bet pre-game so i'd respectfully disagree
robpizzola,just in general but admittedly its largely because of the gambling aspect and not wanting to be glued to a computer again all summer.
robpizzola,there's this little thing called variance. i  daily fantasy sports  think there has been a luckier team over the past two months than chicago.
RASPicks,have we reached a point where more big line moves (especially early in the week) are caused by service releases than pros/groups actually betting?
RASPicks,"replying to 
not a full blown service we may offer some single picks for sale from time to time. will announce more details soon."
RASPicks,here's how ras college football plays have fared vs. the release line and 0.5 to 2.0 points worse than the release line since 2009:
RASPicks,get a $500 ras credit for opening a  daily fantasy sports  account.  great way to test-drive our release methods and new credit system. .co/skacdss9ks
RASPicks,will tweet some bracketbuster full game plays as well as post them on .co/lijtndf field goal k... starting with 838 long beach state pk
RASPicks,we record closing lines for each play on our archive for purpose of tracking closing line value but we do not suggest playing against..(1/2)
RASPicks,ras  college football  week 2 recap:  4-7 -3.7 units |  college football  extra sides (18-5 lifetime coming in 0-5 yesterday) were unexpectedly at fault.
RASPicks,just a topic i feel strongly about & your comparison highlighted the problem.  3 4 5 units = 0.75 1.0 1.25 in real world.
RASPicks,"601 minn lynx +4 (cris greek 5d pinn others)

hate posting so early but doesn't look the the +4 will be around much longer."
VegasRefund,"defensive  touchdown  special teams  touchdown  and a  touchdown  off a turnover..  21 points in under 2 minutes of game clock.

live total is 69.5"
VegasRefund,not sure the old urgency play is the best move on a guy that literally just sat out an entire season to get paid.
VegasRefund,"college basketball  6-2

unh +12.5 
villanova -5 
penn st +1.5 
st. joes -2.5 
asheville +16 
colorado st +7
new orleans +2
uc riverside +7.5"
VegasRefund,resurfacing this system from last year. i wasnt able to keep up with it. i know it profited but regressed from the year before.
VegasRefund,jets have reached an all-time low... when you have an o-lineman catching  touchdown s on you it might be time for some leadership changes.
VegasRefund,"this dude just went from winning $250000 to $300 off of that final darnold int... if you had the jets
it could be worse."
VegasRefund,decent way to start your weekend if you had cubs f5.. and im sorry if you were just a victim of that grand slam..
VegasRefund,new mex st. was by far the most trendy upset of the first round.. and the line has dropped from 5.5 to 3.5 ..
VegasRefund,washst ranked four spots ahead of washington.. receiving 70 percent  of the bets on the road as a double digit underdog... yes that stinks.
ProfessorShine,if i were bungles this weekend id blitz as much as physically possible in as many disguised ways as possible. make it fun guys.
ProfessorShine,vegas airport is now much quicker and easier to grab a cab over uber but for me price was $10-15 more. still worth it
ProfessorShine,and bran has been laying low giving zero info except about his wheelchair cause he knows theyre gonna crown his ass in the end.
ProfessorShine,sports media companies help create a fake legitimacy.  so caveat emptor shouldnt apply.  it doesnt in other legal financial sectors where licensing is required.
ProfessorShine,funny cbs showed auburn winning conference in 85. that team had a nice run in that years tournament. lost in sw 16 to unc
ProfessorShine,the current main sources of solid sports betting info worry more about ratings and affiliate payouts over giving out anything that can help them
suuma810,the titans spent all week scripting their opening drive and the result was: two runs with dion lewis on 1st  10 and 2nd  11.
suuma810,the cardinals didnt have david johnson but their newly acquired kenyan drake had 162 scrimmage yards on 19 touches against a great niners defense.
suuma810,"still 67 days until #nfl season but here's some reading material for you:

#falcons - 
#ravens - 
#panthers - 

team study schedule analysis  predictions."
suuma810,"week 14 recap

6-1 +5.06u

overall: 51-38 +9.79u

after exchanging juice for the bigger part of the season now sitting at 57 percent !"
suuma810,and the #bucs drafted a nose tackle at 12 because their ex-dc thought that stopping the run is the number one priority in 2018.
suuma810,checking in on the #seahawks game. first play i see is a run on first down for 3 yards. guess i didnt miss anything.
ClevTA,its a really bad matchup for no. the only reason sf loses big is 3rd leg of a tough schedule but thats really it
ClevTA,my model has this boise game total at 71 so lots of value. guess u never know how hawaii performs away from the island
ClevTA,its no different than a runner diving for the ez and having having the ball knocked away after it crosses. its clearly a  touchdown
ClevTA,dude ive seen awful calls and technicalities all over the place that normally isnt called. i dont study the rule book inside and out
ClevTA,feels like poor first down success has really hurt the rams this year and has led to more predictable 3rd downs and more pressure
ClevTA,30 seconds after the game ends u   fire an i told u so like u are some sort of genius so just go away
ClevTA,and the jags defense is bad? the same one that held hou to 13 points 4.2 yds per play and watson to 159 yards?
ClevTA,that is  completely false. lines are way over adjusted not adjusted accordingly. a 1 gm sample size isnt nearly enough to make proper adjustments
ClevTA,operation make karma believe thats who i like and dont like and get them off my scent has been activated. see u next monday
ClevTA,i love connelly and used to be my go to but he doesnt do individual team previews which is what i used a ton

spanky,variance is reduced the more outs we get.... this is why we have a minimum restriction of 5 outs to even consider doing business...
spanky,i've given you credit ed. i've retweeted your releases.  i've acknowledged you being the rare exception. what more do you want me to do?
spanky,my pov crosses economic boundaries. pay what you owe collect when your owed. if you cant operate within those guidelines move out the way.
spanky,"this exemplifies whats wrong with the european bookmaking software and methodology.  $33 is too much but $32 is ok! 

how is this really happening?!?"
spanky,i appreciate the several new lucrative betting partnerships weve  established.  without betting partners i would be unable to operate at this level. thank you
spanky,split the check is cool if im out with the same crew often. if i rarely see people id rather just pick it up.
spanky,great point brett. being my partner requires my portion to be guaranteed. when i said doing no work i meant sitting waiting to bet...
spanky,they claim compliance the day after i held 32 percent  and beat them for 65k...  they are unable and unprepared to book sharp action
spanky,is old school. never had the pleasure of meeting him but have heard great things over the years. kudos to  for holding it down
spanky,my limits this morning at  nfl 40k/10k cf 20k/6k nba 10k/4k cb 6k/2k....    my limits now nfl 5k/2k cf 2k/1k nba 500/300 cb 500/300
spanky,youre too much of a pessimist so you choose to say not have bad days instead of saying good days...  i love u dinky
spanky,"agreed.   that is  why i stated ""depending on the payout.""  however there are still a few places out there who provide good teaser prices."
DocBettor,that is  actually why i took the live 4th quarter under as opposed to the live full game under! been burned too many times
DocBettor,if you told me paul george and lou williams would be a combined 6-for-24 shooting i wouldnt have bet this. thanks pat beverley #clippernation
PlusEVAnalytics,but how is it ever going to become the norm if everyone who does it gets accused of some black sox stuff there bob?
PlusEVAnalytics,this could be why the question asks for sqrt(x-3) instead of for x. its the worlds smallest roadblock but its the thought that counts?
PlusEVAnalytics,got to always be thinking a few moves ahead. in 25 years there might be more demand for bollywood film critics than for actuaries...
PlusEVAnalytics,im starting to wonder if theres anyone actually betting these picks or if whoever has bought his package is just betting on the guarantee.
PlusEVAnalytics,what do you think the venn diagram is between only morons buy picks from touts and my retirement is in actively managed mutual funds?
PlusEVAnalytics,gruden deserves this for that 4th  1 punt. idiotic on a good day but trading possession for field position against kc is doubly idiotic.
PlusEVAnalytics,to summarize closing line value implies +ev but lack of closing line value doesnt necessarily imply lack of +ev. i can get with that.
PlusEVAnalytics,this is a case where short term closing line value  short term results. u48 was almost certainly a +ev bet even though it lost.
PlusEVAnalytics,"hey guys what if we take sports betting and remove all the aspects that make sports betting attractive to people?
yeah lets do it!"
PlusEVAnalytics,also something tells me that any asshole who wants a parimutuel license can get one and theyre just too cheap to pay the fee.
PlusEVAnalytics,not as true as it used to be unfortunately...a decade of low interest rates has turned underwriting profit from a bonus to a necessity.
PlusEVAnalytics,this comes from 15 years of answering why does my insurance premium go up after i make a claim - exact same principle applies.
aluckyaday,less than 2000 votes for libdems last time and he had a 5000 majority so will need more than the libdems to unseat him.
aluckyaday,normal in the uk to use an odds comparison site. although using one and only betting top prices will usually end up stake restrictions
aluckyaday,you americans should to be more courteous to your european bookmaker friends. they are not sucker bets they are recreational bets for recreational gamblers.
aluckyaday,one reason to remove the vig. a 100 percent  book will appear efficient on average unless you can systematically quantify what the inefficiency is.
aluckyaday,they are not in the bookmaking business angie. they are in the entertainment business competing with bowling alleys cinemas and bars for disposable income.
aluckyaday,people who want to bet with pinnacle can wherever they are. the corporate books  daily fantasy sports  really want those kind of clients anyway.
aluckyaday,coding is one of those few jobs where your work can be your hobby. we are in the same league as professional sports players
aluckyaday,so have they blocked me? or deleted there account to reappear as someone else? i'm intrigued now as to their motive for doing this.
aluckyaday,and if i was using a single book i would set f3 to be that books average margin for the market i'm betting in?
aluckyaday,this is the exact reason i left northern europe. everything is about making as much money as possible rather than relaxing in the sun
aluckyaday,better than expected results or is everyone just so excited because they are going to be able to watch love island twice a year!
aluckyaday,"google translation made me giggle. ""with an incredible solidity which allowed him to stand with the big cocks in 'la planche des belles filles'"""
aluckyaday,that is a good point. over what period do do they calculate how much the contribution should be? can any losses be rolled over?
aluckyaday,if you can bet with skybet norway at 28/1 each way first five is probably the closest you will get to a +ev bet.
aluckyaday,horrendous scenes in paris. happy memories of 2 sixth form half term trips. partying on the hotel stairway whilst dubious things were going upstairs!
theFirmAISports,thanks. and yeah we are no happy with our start... its a long season but we arent helping ourselves with these 2 weeks haha

joeytunes2,agree  that is  the new age. info carries fast. if you read something or get info on a game  it is  all systems go.
joeytunes2,the criminals get the ak47's. the cops get 9mm. we need to stop worrying a little about human rights. when fighting for our lives.
joeytunes2,haha why would i be cracked. i dont claim to be great at baseball. i gave the tip out i fired in. i won.
EdMillerPoker,depends if i'm allowed to stand in the corner awkwardly for an hour and then leave or if i have to talk to people
EdMillerPoker,no interest in engaging a proxy. but im sure you will find takers to bet our stuff into you if you offer fair rules.
EdMillerPoker,if you do a good job tho for sure the book will find an audience and will continue to do so for 10+ years
EdMillerPoker,just nuts. who thinks its a good idea to force someone to buy a thing without any demands on the quality of the thing??
EdMillerPoker,im not sure about all the logistics but altruistic donors facilitate pairing substantially bc of how the math works. altruistic donors are uncommon tho.
EdMillerPoker,the industry in general wont be ready for good customer experiences for a few years at least. none of the backend is built yet.
GolcondaFund,yeah cards was right side but toss up game. fins never shoulda covered and darnold was healthy af. steelers jets sharp rest fluky imo.
LeeSharpeNFL,in the nba half the teams make the playoffs. this has devalued the meaning of the regular season significantly. this is imo quite bad.
LeeSharpeNFL,taking five numbers putting them through a formula and then spitting out a single number. can you imagine being that much of a nerd?
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah vs. two nfc east teams and the lions. reality will return when bears play packers chiefs and vikings to close out the season.
LeeSharpeNFL,"me: maybe this will be a normal seahawks game  it is  starting to look like one.

seahawks: ha ha ha ha you doubt us"
LeeSharpeNFL,sorry i didn't mean i'd become a cowboys fan i meant i'd become a dak fan once he's on the bears. sorry for confusion.
LeeSharpeNFL,shows the xfl is not trying to be the aaf either (e.g. the xfl sees itself as a competitor not a minor league/talent development)
LeeSharpeNFL,i hope it is a fun exciting game with no injuries or officiating controversies and you and your friend have a great dinner. :)
LeeSharpeNFL,if the sample size of affected qbs really is that low it sure is getting far more attention than it deserves from tv pundits.
whale_capper,nfl playoff picture framing... prepare yourself for a shocking heel turn in the nfc while we continue to see purple in the afc enjoy!
whale_capper,got three in the chamber tomorrow assuming the power numbers  daily fantasy sports  move too much... we'll get on the same side eventually right?
whale_capper,close game favors an under plus getting a pretty long tail of bucks blowout which would turn the 4q into a 40 point stinker
AndyMSFW,all it takes is a couple minutes spent in the comments of any political post to realize  it is  not so bad over here.
AndyMSFW,i follow you so i think that says all you need to know about the expectations i go through life with.  (but not really)
AndyMSFW,in a wild turn of events the san francisco 49ers are just one interception away from matching last years int total! really taking strides.
AndyMSFW,she knows you need your hands up to protect your face but she can't take her left off her gut.  i'd imagine it hurts.
AndyMSFW,i bet money on a woman to take her shirt off at the world cup.  you think i won't bet on someone to puke?
AndyMSFW,you can for sure lose a +games underdog spread bet and still have your player win the match in an odd case like that.
JoeyKnish22,booked. legitimately hoping you win the entire thing for picking that handle so we can have the screenshot of that entry being #1 forever.
JoeyKnish22,which book which book bear whick book has that number . boy if i havent had that exact interaction with ppl a million times.
JoeyKnish22,i like the full game better tbh hopefully miami puts in the white kids when its 38-0 4q and we get a  touchdown .
JoeyKnish22,lmao if you had bama only -3 at auburn with tua you might wanna go back to the drawing board on those power ratings.
JoeyKnish22,at least she just calls the game. i dont need a cheap comedy routine while im watching a game the football is the entertainment.
JoeyKnish22,hes flying back the collins deal opened up some more space i think uncle jerry gets the deal done and he plays week 1.
JoeyKnish22,yeah was big time in high school but gave it up for b-ball. retired from euroball to join avp already t10 player on tour.
JoeyKnish22,does lsu football still qualify as a real sport when they lose to bama again this year for the 80th time in a row?
JoeyKnish22,big fail on my part but im about to order a make at home kit on amazon so dont write me off just yet.
JoeyKnish22,the annual knish 4th of july party people know not to come until the contest is over incase i lose a bunch of money.
TheKostos,should 100 percent  be a pk and a red card for the spurs keeper. he hit alonso with a street fighter spin kick lol
TheKostos,#29 on cleveland are you kidding. how do you not push the receiver out of the end zone??? (i didn't bet cleveland just saying)
TheKostos,i think lamar is the single scariest player to go against in the fantasy playoffs. i'd rather face mccaffrey and  it is  not close
TheKostos,"totals
browns/dolphins over 45.5
titans/jags over 41
bucs/falcons over 51
steelers/bengals under 39

sides
broncos +4
cowboys +6.5
49ers -3
jets +3.5
rams +3.5"
TheKostos,im always too lazy after the  sunday night football  game to change the channel. have already heard about four stabbings on the local news
TheKostos,kendrick bourne needs to hit the bricks man. i  daily fantasy sports  care about a  touchdown  catch or 2 point catch he's been terrible
TheKostos,the browns will come back and cover by a half point the one time i  daily fantasy sports  bet them. life ain't fair kids
TheKostos,i am fairly certain i am going to bet alabama and the over i will accept all prayers and well wishes in advance tysm
TheKostos,"#nbanick just capped tonight's card.

looking like at least three plays.

i'll reveal them tonight in the  #powerhour (6-7pm et) alongside    presented by  #ad"
TheKostos,no issues with moxley winning and enjoyed the match. guessing the jericho program will continue through the next ppv and thats cool with me.
TheKostos,"amani is the single-most underappreciated wr of this century but he's also not as good as odell beckham sorry not sorry!!!

(love you amani)"
TheKostos,obviously had numerous clutch moments in 07 but there were stretches (02 most notably) where he was a top 3-5 wr in the league
TheKostos,i have been on hold for customer service for 55 minutes. i was told the wait was 10 minutes or less. what has happened?
TheKostos,. live from chicago 10a-12p et on  the  app and other entercom stations around the country. pumped to break down wild-card weekend!      bob scucci
LockyLockerson,we got off the rails a number of times tonight but i think in almost every case it actually led to a fun discussion.
LockyLockerson,tuesday nba and college basketball projections/analysis up for the night over at the patreon page!  time to go to sleep cursing jim boylen's name.
LockyLockerson,everything i'm reading doesn't even really hint at him sitting yet though although i guess  it is  a front end so just making sure.
LockyLockerson,i'm not sure i can watch singular nfl games live anymore.  either redzone or dvr (w/ fast forward) for me.  this is absolutely excruciating.
LockyLockerson,happy to announce i'll be joining  and  on their podcast tomorrow for a deep dive on the upcoming college football season.  should be fun!
LockyLockerson,"i'll have a blog post up later tonight with some extended thoughts and the ""what"" and the ""why"" for people that are really interested."
LockyLockerson,daily fantasy sports  worry guys if there's an x's and o's mastermind who can get us to the finish line  it is  roy williams

DannyParkins,damn marcus peters has 25 interceptions since 2015 which is the most in the nfl. second most? darius slay and reggie nelson with 16.
DannyParkins,quintana seemed none too pleased to be coming out there. this is an uncomfortable spot for brad brach. cubs lead back down to 4.
DannyParkins,lol ill choose to take that as a compliment but im gonna do 25ish more years of drivetime before im ready for that move
DannyParkins,2 bogeys and 2 double bogeys since this tweet my 25:1 bet is dead and im all-in on tiger for the storybook comeback now...
DannyParkins,i took under 71 points in the 2d half theres no way that output is repeated either way barring a free throw festival late

chadmillman,"scooch: ""heh heh. yes! the public saw sea struggle  lose last week while indy won  people like brissett. this line should be higher. 2/3"
chadmillman,been thinking about skill v chance debate in  daily fantasy sports  today. remembered i wrote this 2010 column when  daily fantasy sports  first started.
chadmillman,the podcast when  talks lsu as a  college football  value pick his title faves and why he was scared to buy his house .co/ttabdlsblx
chadmillman,"u can now get gambling odds/infoeg wk 1 nfl linesvia alerts thru espn app. choose ""chalk: odds  info alerts"" from app ""edit alerts"" page."
chadmillman,new bff no.1    daily fantasy sports  think anyone in handicapping history has been as right about anything as u were about falcons win total
Gingfacekillah,i have some models spreadsheets and ideas related to those sports in my book as uncouth as it is to recommend my own book:
Gingfacekillah,"has a written a great book here. technical enough to improve your bayesian stats skills approachable enough that your eyes wont glaze over. 

recommended."
Gingfacekillah,me neither but the article provides some contemporaneous evidence that the vikes might be intentionally run heavy this year.  it is  worth a look.
Gingfacekillah,i havent heard back from amazon but it looks like theyre only making the ebook version available on the au site. not sure why.
Gingfacekillah,toutr: a dumb little r code snippet that generates a random pick for any binary outcome wager. non-sensical tout analysis included for your entertainment.
Gingfacekillah,the guy has a penchant for non-constructive ranting. take a look at his work on  pinnacle article tweet for exhibits a b and c.
Gingfacekillah,i plan on posting them yes. still have to test to see if i've got something but i like what i'm seeing so far.
Gingfacekillah,"his ""business"" model is basically the textbook definition of negligent misrepresentation with the possible exception that reliance on his picks is arguably not reasonable."
Gingfacekillah,do you like his minutes for tonight though? spread of 13 likely won't have to play his standard 29. i'm thinking more like 25-26.
Gingfacekillah,home ice advantage does indeed exist in the nhl. its usually worth about 0.24 goals or about 3.3 percent  to the win  percent .
logan_matthews9,i sometimes think im on the wrong side of the counter but then books throw up inter miami +.5 at -113 and i reconsider
logan_matthews9,had a lot of these kids nowadays with their fancy machine learning vibes to it. anyways love the podcast totally disagreed with that section
logan_matthews9,this is another example of why you should hire me for that position you still havent posted - can help improve your twitter game
logan_matthews9,im not sure how 50 percent + of democrats thinking  a candidate cant beat trump is in any way a positive thing for them
logan_matthews9,hes not really played out of position though. when the us have possession hell play the same role then as he does for rbl
logan_matthews9,snagged magic at -4.5 (which it opened) as this was announced. already moved to -5 likely slides more. kings played in miami last night
logan_matthews9,gsw missed a three with 18 seconds left... and no knicks crashed the boards so they put it back uncontested. tough one to watch
PikachuBets,huge shocker that real modelers who know what theyre doing wouldnt want to work for anyone instead of betting their own stuff. im shook
PikachuBets,bro how fucking broke are you that you need to plaster your bovada referral in this thread for everyone to sign up at lol
PikachuBets,this will become super popular. designed with addiction in mind. fobts in uk attract the worst degens who often turn violent after bad losses
PikachuBets,hes in the record saying he bet nothing on those plays. cmon. hes down nearly 15u in mlb this season. just get a clue
PikachuBets,"""i still have a ways to go to reach the top""

you  daily fantasy sports  say you still have a paypal donation link up.........."
PikachuBets,oh yah he reads everything about him on twitter and reddit no questions about it. it makes subtweeting him constantly even more worth it
PikachuBets,screen midpoint closed -380 tell us more about how you got 73c of closing line value and creamed no vig on this one champ
PikachuBets,news came like 2-3 hours on thu after i bet. this morning it was already +140. +110 hasn't been available since like fri morning
adamchernoff,"assuming (big assumption) nothing crazy happens this week you set the odds...

hou at bal
ne at kc
no at gb
sea at sf"
adamchernoff,bookmaker margins dictate movement in nfl markets. knowing the margins and which books influence movement is far more important than looking at public/sharp percentages.
adamchernoff,information. player injuries coaches interviews etc. it can be this simple if you like or much much more in-depth if you have the time.
adamchernoff,not sure what i make of either. but you bring up a good point on that. the review does kill the match for sure.
adamchernoff,"get set for the final group stage matches of #copaamerica this weekend. 

my best bet along with a full breakdown of the games below."
adamchernoff,estimated runs are generated the day prior and compared to the total at the time. estimated runs do not change based on the total.
adamchernoff,no different from any other market. just add the sum of probability for all teams in the market and subtract from 100 percent .
adamchernoff,nope still super narrow maybe more and the plastic upper digs in. sucks. other ones were narrow too but at least comfy as hell.
adamchernoff,taking the mrs to paris for a week to determine if the bread and cheese really is better than anywhere else in the world.

kellyinvegas,i know i already posted this but wanted to reshare. the funeral was today but teegan is still fighting for her life in icu
kellyinvegas,all of that goes into it. the math is the primary basis for making a play. the stats/trends/market analysis/injuries/overreactions go into it as well.
kellyinvegas,the caribbean side buddy. its on the east coast of the country. ive never been to the east coast of cr. only the west.

ToddFuhrman,ha this was an impressive effort but would have been nice if georgia made a field goal or caught a pass to stay competitive
ToddFuhrman,thanks mikey same to you and yours and heres hoping this weekends games go better for the good guys than monday night football !
ToddFuhrman,"""no love for georgia from the customers today florida definitely our worst result across the board"" via  risk team on today's  college football  liabilities"

TheCousinSal,i realize tampa bay hasnt had the ball yet but its 1:07pm et and jameis still hasnt thrown a pick.  starting to get worried.
TheCousinSal,on an all-new #againstallodds podcast my  co-hosts  and  and i discuss our on-air competition the state of sports gambling and  courageous battle with ringworm.
TheCousinSal,this match was a roller coaster for bettors as well who at certain points couldve live-wagered djokovic at +800 and federer at +600. #wimbledon2019
TheCousinSal,congratulations to the world champion raptors. the warriors healthy stars jonas jerebko quinn cook and andrew bogut just had no answer for torontos resilience.
TheCousinSal,cbs needs duke here in a big way. if im an executive i hedge with a $13 million halftime bet on michigan st. #marchmadness2019
TheCousinSal,dont get me wrong. i love missed wide open shots more than the next guy...but virginia/oregon/texas tech/michigan are really taking things to another level.
TheCousinSal,won his daytona 500 bet and the week by .02 seconds - which is exactly how long this acceptance speech should be. #notbitteratall #lockitin
TheCousinSal,i know i point this out every 3 or 4 hours but jason garrett has got to go. look... this time even he agrees....
TheCousinSal,up 30 points in the fourth quarter - jason garrett just went for it on 4th and 1 from the opponents 42.  #princetonpride #headscratcher
TheCousinSal,and for this very reason   and i are wagering a ton that the winner's final shot will be under 3.5 feet. thanks prez! #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,its been several hours since chloe kim dominated the half pipe and still no reports of her urinating on a gas pump. #americanhero #olympicwintergames
TheCousinSal,brutal brutal loss for the bengals. and it gets worse for them as i'm starting andy dalton in my fantasy playoff game next week.
TheCousinSal,most rigged video poker machines in a casino...the ones people camp behind just to watch the nfl games. no way those ever pay out.
TheCousinSal,harrys wv pick went to his big bald head so much that he finally decided to join twitter. apologies in advance for the grammar
TheCousinSal,special thanks to whoevers in charge of the halftime smoke show in foxboro. watching the 3rd 1/4 in silhouette has been great fun #atlvsne
TheCousinSal,this loss will come back to haunt the bucs. if the pats score 19 in your backyard you have to win that game twice.
TheCousinSal,jesse's gfriend overdose in season 2 (not even a top ten moment on bb) was 100x as intense as anything on bcs so far
TheCousinSal,did you legally bet on atlanta to win today? can you prove it? i may have $100 for you in 2 minutes on  #badbeatbuyback
TheCousinSal,great fight so far. both men seem very focused on letting me win my bet of over 11.5 rounds. keep it up fellas! #kovalevward
TheCousinSal,i'm giving away $100 to whoever can prove they had the worst bad beat in the early games.  going live in 5 minutes on
TheCousinSal,"""jacksonville will receive the 2nd half kickoff"" - nfl network's hilarious attempt to keep viewers from giving up on this crapfest of a game"
TheCousinSal,so if the left cheek is down it counts as the entire rectum? i feel like a complete ass for never knowing this.  #balvsten
12Xpert,i haven't. if it works bet it and make money. if others have already thought of it and the edge has gone basically irrelevant.
12Xpert,at the scale of everything by definition there must be full efficiency because the probability of something happening is 1 and something always happens.
12Xpert,is this a bot? i've already told you i  daily fantasy sports  have live game data so i  daily fantasy sports  bother with in-play.
12Xpert,there is not a hope in hell that a sports fund would give you 11 percent  given the sorts of markets they invest in.
12Xpert,theres little point in holding a referendum if parliament will never agree to one of the outcomes. democracy is more than just parliamentary law.
12Xpert,"first wisdom of crowds selections for 2019/2020:

the name of the bookmaker is no longer included so to find the best price check oddsportal."
12Xpert,as for the media controlling us its a handy conspiracy to trot out when it suits which at its worst strays into anti semitism.
12Xpert,life is full of risk and uncertainty. anything that equips us with tools better able to handle those things is surely a positive force.
12Xpert,it is  a structural bias where fewer than 50 percent  of favourites cover the spread. reported by levitt in nfl (around 48 percent ).
JambosPicks,"weve got another over under sweat as we recommended the under 5.5 (f5) in #whitesox-#angels and its a 4-1 game in the 5th.

mschwimer,then how do you explain  declining our offer despite us saying we will put $1m up front in a back account of thier choosing?
mschwimer,this clearly applies to you. if you are going to chip. at least have the stones to back it up. at jambos we do
mschwimer,thank you very much! i couldnt agree more. its a dirty dirty industry. but if i have any say it will be cleaned up!
mschwimer,the most ridiculous thing is that  is suppose to be the gold standard yet they are not transparent or financially accountable for their recommendations.
mschwimer,what? of course you can see all prior picks. scroll to the bottom of records by sport and click to see all individual plays.

RufusPeabody,congrats to my sister  for qualifying for the sold out  grandslam championship tonight at lincoln theatre in dc. this is the big time!
RufusPeabody,to be fair i think machine learning has lots of great applications in sports modeling but wouldnt approach the entire process that way.
RufusPeabody,was referring to gary danielson telling gene salvatore that he couldn't be the first to touch the ball after being out of bounds.
RufusPeabody,did you see my other tweets on the matter.  it is  more of a general topic for touts than something specific to jambos.
RufusPeabody,i was afraid mentioning it could be a legal issue. but mike opened himself up to me commenting on it with his comments.
RufusPeabody,then feel free to ignore them. but the thought that you have any idea what has value in the betting market is laughable.
RufusPeabody,michael is most definitely a better salesman than me. he could absolutely destroy me in a debate regardless of what side hes arguing.
RufusPeabody,charley hoffman is one of the 6 for (2). he's 0-for-3 with the solo 54-hole lead and 0-for-5 with a share of it.
RufusPeabody,i'm not saying you  daily fantasy sports . i'm just saying  it is  still not transparent. vegas dave could make the same claim.
RufusPeabody,i thought these guys weren't going to cut sharp limits  they seem to be doing it more aggressively than any other nj book.
RufusPeabody,new jersey #gamblingtwitter -- power ranking time. how would you rank the operators in your state (    resorts   caesars  hard rock golden nugget
RufusPeabody,"my cantlay odds pre-tourney: 44.3/1
my cantlay odds post-round 1: 45.7/1

so if you're to believe my modeling  simulations (c) is the answer."
RufusPeabody,what it is is a good deal for the syndicate  that is  getting the good prices and a bad deal for everyone else.
RufusPeabody,i'm not endorsing that.  that is  a decision operators have to make. but if they offer a product it needs to be fair.
jeffma,what if gostkowski misses an extra point or tom brady never gets the ball in overtime. narratives dont drive good decisions math does
jeffma,tony bennet is a boss. his postgame press conference is all class. in a time when no human being could be that poised
SportsCheetah,bahahahahaha i was having lunch with my kids just hadn't seen his tweet for awhile. i had to double-take the 0 likes though.
SportsCheetah,buffalo is going to run for a million. only -500 to win this game if you're into that sort of bahamas bowl beat.
SportsCheetah,"25 dinners on me if you add the three words ""most improved player"" to the luka monologue for tomorrow. thank you in advance."

dinkinc,maybe someday roenick will tell the story of his involvement with one of the worst of the scam touts back in the day
dinkinc,derby city.  historical horse racing without horse racing. slot machine ruled a game of skill which is anything but. our government at work
dinkinc,they all try to pick winners.... they  daily fantasy sports  understand how value works....  ticket structure is a foreign concept.... dummy down syndrome

robpizzola,fair enough but wisconsin +0.6 net ypp and im going to venture a guess that they are dominating successful plays as well today.
robpizzola,that is  what everyone said about the capitals for years. can't beat the pens. crosby owns them. and then they figured it out.
robpizzola,this was all that was running through my head as jason garrett decided to kick a  field goal  late in the fourth quarter.
robpizzola,gonna be amazing when point and cirelli get ruled out and that still isn't enough to get anyone to bet on the rangers.
robpizzola,congrats to my friend and overall great guy   it is  only a matter of time before he's on espn live scalping nba games.
robpizzola,just spoke to a guy that said the ground was shaking so much that he thought there was a car mowing people down.
robpizzola,he's not a detractor he's still an above average goalie. but he was elite from 2012-2015 and has been falling off since then.
RASPicks,"you  daily fantasy sports  agree it is amazing to have ""many pro bettors"" subscribing but the lines do not move at all?  lol."
RASPicks,2) the average ras subscriber consistently gets within a point of the release line.  doing that has won at 56.6 percent  l/6 years.
RASPicks,we have an open refund policy but very small  percent  ask for one.  every pick is displayed on site 8 minutes after start.
RASPicks,continuing to suggest they are similar to openers is silly.  they aren't close.  1h's are available on some of our  college football  releases.
RASPicks,"things like giving our plays to a third party before release or ""no limit on # of plays"" were never going to happen."
RASPicks,ras college football l/5 years 209-143 59.4 percent  and 35-17 67.3 percent  in first week of season.  side release in six days.   .co/zkej9z74uc
RASPicks,as i indicated on podcast it is much easier to win as a bettor than it is on a service with large following.
RASPicks,line services cant display pinn wk 1 ncaa fb lines. they are displayed and numbered as props on your site.  can you fix?
RASPicks,"final numbers for ras ""sweet spot"" package:  161-119 +33.45 units 57.50 percent  +2.00 clv.  our best first 10 weeks of a season ever."
RASPicks,it hasn't.  we've beaten the closing line on 10 of last 14 picks and all 7 releases are beating current lines this week.
VegasRefund,ive literally never watched the skills challenge until tonight.. and this is a joke. just add these dudes to the three point contest.
VegasRefund,"seahawks +1

VegasRefund,"setting the over under at 4.5 for christmas car commercials tonight. heavy juice on the over.

ProfessorShine,no. hes using an opener that was used for marketing to fit his shitty trend narrative.   legit openers were basically wa -4.5 -105\-110.
ProfessorShine,no guarantee coach will even follow it.   organization has to be committed to these decisions.  like pats and now the eagles. even colts
ProfessorShine,your job darren is engagement.  youre good at it.  youve said yourself relevance is what matters.  !no serious bettor cares about that info.
ProfessorShine,i actually dont think my deal is crazy.    at that volume ill billy walter the market with more headfakes than a prime hakeem
ProfessorShine,blocked me for being critical of bretts must follow sports gambling list that included rj.  seems theyd prefer i not read their articles.
ProfessorShine,my issue with josh  sportsinsights is fade the public is severely flawed yet they sell it to the public.  then block all feedback
ProfessorShine,true on feet pics not the female boundaries thing.  kelly took her cues from fuhrman who has a career pretending to be sharp
ProfessorShine,seems lazy on his part.  also seems like an easy thing to lie about if she got stiffed on tip.  no pun intended

joeytunes2,playing nyg home dog nfc east. always closes close to 3 but in this case will close 4.5. cooperi nursing injuries zeek un-clear
joeytunes2,every game sdsu played in ly was with in 8 pts. only 2 non conference that werent. season prob coulda gone either way.
joeytunes2,the difference in the yankees record this year is  that is  there 80 percent  against the orioles. last  year they were 50 percent
joeytunes2,i hope there are more books to open market up. closing greek hurt.  it is  almost at the point of a universal number
joeyisaks,with the new 3 batter rule no lhp might be ahead of the curve. pirates are also leading the way in corona prevention

joeyisaks,ya 2h 30.5 was basically same as pre game total if only g state got  touchdown  end of reg from 1 yard line
joeyisaks,shes a bad person. i know people whove organized events that shes attended / keynote speaker of that have nothing positive to say
joeyisaks,classic tout tactic. give out losing negative expected value picks and then say hope you took 5.5 (a line that never even existed)
joeyisaks,horse racing was fading to obscurity so they decided to copy major sports like nfl and decide a race by questionable replay result
EdMillerPoker,just received a 10 percent  off coupon as my compensation in a class action settlement. apparently getting sued is a marketing opportunity now.
EdMillerPoker,you focus on a product that complements what others build rather than trying to all fight over the same $5 8-team parlay bet
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  think  that is  fair tbh tho there's def a good bit of fake it till you make it going on
EdMillerPoker,the part about where arabic numerals came from is nonsense. the part where al-khwrizm was a major figure in mathematics history is correct.
EdMillerPoker,awesome thanks. it will be in paperback by the release date june 4. amazon just has different rules for listing the paperback versions.
EdMillerPoker,this is not a theoretical concern either. the current state of nfl data is its not good enough to deal in-game markets from.
EdMillerPoker,ahh yes this is because you do not speak nit. offer them fifty cents an hour credit at postmates and they'll be happy.
EdMillerPoker,sports betting is a game and the markets are toys. dont think its a good place to look for counter examples to  thesis.
EdMillerPoker,ok who is selling girl scout cookies for less than $5 a box if you know pls msg this is v v important
EdMillerPoker,weak. here at worldchangers inc we withhold your salary until you hit 120 but then when you hit 200 you get a flamethrower
nonrandomalpha,you have a skill for cherry-picking. if this were financial advice finra would sanction you out of existence. youre part of the problem.
nonrandomalpha,200k followers?! dang i assume you must be quite the compelling handicapper to have commanded such an audience. share some winners with us
nonrandomalpha,vintage colt mccoy v the pats circa 2010. except this time he doesnt have the support of the one and only peyton hillis
nonrandomalpha,every time ej says something you come bk with a brutal burn. ej is 3rd degree burn victim right now punching the air.
nonrandomalpha,great research and great calls son. some dont appreciate the time effort and energy behind the scenes to produce these kinds of results
nonrandomalpha,its empirically proven that those industries are demonstrably higher-risk; its irrelevant whether or not youre sufficiently competent to understand or appreciate the results.
LeeSharpeNFL,no  it is  obviously a negative but i'm saying that it is one play in a large sample and should be treated accordingly.
LeeSharpeNFL,just gonna steal robert mays idea and put this game on mute for a while.  let us  all stop reliving the 2017 draft.
LeeSharpeNFL,also minutes if nothing else will want to reduce the chances of gb getting a bye in the playoffs because fuck the packers.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i have tb +3 even today.

saw it close at tb +3 -120 so i'm glad i got it at the better odds."
LeeSharpeNFL,the networks like to have a single big (almost) nationwide game. i hate it. but they certainly aren't optimizing for redzone watchers alas.
LeeSharpeNFL,"as for the ""bad file argument"" error i've never seen that before. do you get it every time you run or just sometimes?"
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  know what this means. the offense always controls the flow of the game. they get to snap the ball.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i ""want to"" but my model doesn't and i'm trusting it. market is at +220 i'm at +186. not enough to bet.

whale_capper,no doubt theyve wildly improved defensively... expecting thornhill absence to be especially problematic vs bal though plus harbs v reid is a mismatch
whale_capper,would make sea -2.5 in phi and no -7 vs min... seen hou -3 and ne -5.5 but not at the market makers
whale_capper,totally arbitrary but generally captures the window over which teams have made adjustments and the market is/is not catching up to the performance
whale_capper,the bottom right quad is teams that are consistently exceeding expectations on offense and underperforming on defense which has resulted in more overs
whale_capper,yeah i feel not great about this play but all we need is some reasonably competent defense and the clowns can cover 13
whale_capper,well i already bet it at +3 and my opinion hasnt changed but pretty clearly the market disagrees which is a bad sign
whale_capper,i have an int rate for sf of 0.37 percent  int-rate log-normally distributed with an average of 2.5 percent  and ln-sd of 0.336
whale_capper,yeah you're in a bit of a pickle... i'd look for someone with huge djoker exposure and try to find a vig-free hedge
whale_capper,i know a couple guys that hit that for the max but i dont want to spoil it if that comes to fruition
whale_capper,oh well make it interesting... id like to discuss that as part of an overall framing of how worldwide betting markets stack up
AndyMSFW,"the lawyer actually said leaving an illegal offshore account to a semi-anonymous twitter account wasn't a ""good idea"" and to ""leave his office"""
AndyMSFW,i'll have to add that column again it was interesting to watch.  high variance proposition to bet huge mls like that at volume.
AndyMSFW,if indy punches this in i will have won a full game over and lost a full game under by halftime today.  #historic
AndyMSFW,i think i'm just salty because i defended him in the past and have had to watch him make poor decisions this year
AndyMSFW,"back in my day we didn't call it ""grinding"" but it is nice not having to worry about her walking in on you."
AndyMSFW,"two more week 7 nfl totals for i'ma grab before i call it a night:

ravens/seahawks o51 -105 (lowvig)"
AndyMSFW,it is  a nice set up!  i'll nuke some pizza rolls you grab some natty ice and we'll skip biology lecture tomorrow morning.
AndyMSFW,you'd think his family would let him know what this outfit looks like before he went out in public like this... oh wait
AndyMSFW,if the center of the distribution were downtown san francisco the 2018 49ers would be roughly as far away as their stadium is
AndyMSFW,we wanted to take some college ball but felt unqualified.  so we'll be bringing in a best selling author to help us out.

AndyMSFW,"hopefully someone saw this and said ""i  daily fantasy sports  think i have that at my book i'll just hit the over instead..."""
JoeyKnish22,jim nance wondering why the browns are going for 2 early. is pure old guy play by play if ive ever heard it.
JoeyKnish22,just try and follow the rules this year we had to put in the rob clause so ppl dont fuck up their entries.
JoeyKnish22,"im not even watching steelers/browns. just seeing the check-ins on redzone. 

and ive heard the duck hodges/james washington hunting together story 3 times."
JoeyKnish22,"the over was the bet here folks. not either side. just like  told ya. 

(i didnt put any money on the total )"
JoeyKnish22,although since the bears have hot trub at qb and no kicker that  field goal  probably just won it. so maybe im wrong.
JoeyKnish22,plumlee might be the fastest white guy ive seen since that one usa white dude won gold in the 200m at the olympics.
JoeyKnish22,im not sure those curtains go well with the beige couch if this hits would consider swapping those out for something more neutral.
JoeyKnish22,yes it would be much better if everyone just kept quiet on any unfair/unethical practices and allowed shops to operate with complete impunity
JoeyKnish22,valid point. imagine how bad they woulda beat the patriots ass in those super bowls had dimes been the qb instead of manning.
JoeyKnish22,looking to hire a couple ditch diggers to start immediately. previous experience preferred. please bring a couple gallons of bleach to the interview.
JoeyKnish22,somebody tell mason if linde goes out drinking saturday night we can slide in lines by noon est sunday before hes even up.
JoeyKnish22,honestly it took such a high deflection he had to think it was off target. not sure he coulda got to it anyway.
TheKostos,leaning drake over boone in one league (half ppr) b/c i have boone exposure in some other title gamers i'm not nuts right?
TheKostos,. joins us next  to go thru the nfl card and whatever  college basketball / college football  degeneracy he's got going on too.
TheKostos,imagine needing tyler lockett to do anything tonight in fantasy and he's dancing in the end zone after david moore catches a  touchdown
TheKostos,the refs gave the chargers about 15 extra seconds. that was insane. i  daily fantasy sports  think mike williams went out of bounds
TheKostos,it was the right move to go for it. down 20 with the heisman winner on the other side. pathetic decision to punt
TheKostos,we will be on shortly and will get right into the game breakdowns. follow  for the link as soon as we go live
TheKostos,out of all the 90s wcw people in the news now sonny onoo has to be at the bottom of the likable list
TheKostos,i like bayern and the over. chelsea should score and i think bayern net at least two. total sitting at 2.5 and 3.
TheKostos,"we hit so much #goodshit on last night's show. everything you need to win $$ this weekend. 

rate/review/subscribe if you'd be so kind!"
TheKostos,yanks will still win the al east and deserve to be the ws favorite but bet their rsw over at your own peril
TheKostos,looking to move yeezy 700 v1 inertias size 10.5 original box terrific condition. can supply video of them if asked. hmu if interested
TheKostos,i might regret this but i  daily fantasy sports  think any nfl team is capable of screwing up joe burrow. he's that good.
TheKostos,btw im very much into david baker telling people theyve made the hof on live television. two sick moments this weekend. loved it
TheKostos,yo can we talk about the seahawks dropping clowney in coverage on 3rd and the season. feels like that isnt getting enough play
TheKostos,ready to roll.  live 10am-12pm et live from   and entercom stations around the country.   and bob scucci will join. lets get this $$!
LockyLockerson,"on ""borders"" when he's yelling ""who hurt you"" all i can think of is peter griffin listening to lionel richie on family guy."
LockyLockerson,at least you can play acoustic guitar on the streets to earn a few bucks.  all i know how to do is degen.
LockyLockerson,hurts getting smashed young and fields about to split votes for ohio state... sure seems like smooth sailing for burrow-for-heisman thus far today
LockyLockerson,going to put early kickoff stuff up tonight and the rest tomorrow since i gotta be up way too early with the kids.
LockyLockerson,has anyone ever gotten dennys delivered? i cant believe this is a service that is offered and that there would be any demand
LockyLockerson,i  daily fantasy sports  even like them that much i just think their chances of making the playoff are better than 2-ish  percent
LockyLockerson,in most of the way their brackets can fall as of now that would be valuable but so much left to be determined.
LockyLockerson,all i can think of is the south park guys doing the steeeeeve perry but with scott who is now running the knicks
EliHershkovich,"catch up on the  original in the meantime. 

fantastic nfl and  college football  breakdown over the past few days plus great conversations with"
EliHershkovich,"mets were 200-1 to win the world series on july 28 (via

EliHershkovich,despite 92 percent  of the money on raptors-warriors o213 (via  the over under shifted to 212.5. golden state now a six-point favorite too.
EliHershkovich,zion can't win a ncaa title but he'll all of a sudden vault new orleans to that level. turn it down a notch.
DannyParkins,definitely not. i just watch every big time broadcast and no one else comes close to explaining the decisions as well as nbc.
DannyParkins,no i didnt. i picked mahomes to win mvp actually. i bet trubisky bc of the value of the ticket. see the difference?
DannyParkins,this loss is pretty pretty painful and might be the tipping point to some of the changes theo said were being discussed  today.
DannyParkins,i bet molinari 25:1 pre tourney so that bogey immediately after the tweet was inevitable. tiger should thank me for my mushing powers.
DannyParkins,having our video guy brian gertsch with us has been invaluable to the #scorehouse trip. check out all the videos hes doing here:
DannyParkins,luging a beer off the lombardi trophy is an innovative move by travis kelce that will be copied for the next 100 years
DannyParkins,the top 7 passer rating teams in the nfl made the playoffs so im not sure what you could possibly be talking about
chadmillman,ill be at this game tonight and i picked florida state to make the final four so i gave this story extra attention.
chadmillman,you could spend the next two hours working to find betting and fantasy angles on the internet. or just read this  round up.
chadmillman,tiger woods and phil mickelson will play in the ryder cup. you can bet on many things involving them and the ryder cup.
chadmillman,our golf analyst  also happens to be a  playing partner. he breaks down his  chances with ridic anecdote about romo swiping tigers putter.
chadmillman,good question.   did a series on how to live vegas life including this from  on what to do when there for super bowl.
chadmillman,"very much looking forward to the ""total number of plays"" props as well as the ""in-game references to his science and system"" props."

Gingfacekillah,doing a little index etf portfolio backtesting today. nothing fancy just a permutation of john bogle's indexing strategies albeit a touch more aggressive.
Gingfacekillah,too tight on the spreads to make any selections. for the 1q 1h and free throw totals though we would've won all 3.
Gingfacekillah,thanks for all the suggestions. im going to try them all and appreciate being exposed to new ideas that can improve understanding. cheers!
Gingfacekillah,nba total: mem/hou over 200.5 over 1 standard deviation below exp. total. heavy lean on the over good value. #nba #handicapping #sharpaction #sportsbetting
logan_matthews9,its only 11-9 ***so far! people always forget that piece. lots of time to hit that very inefficient market of the nfl playoffs
logan_matthews9,no one is saying mls = premier league. but the elite players of the league are mid-table premier league quality (almiron yedlin etc).
logan_matthews9,the prop odds on lavert seem crazy. dude has owned the philly bench. over 21.5 points paying 2 to 1 is real nice
PikachuBets,dm her see how much it'll cost to tout your maction only way to find out how much zofran to order for you
PikachuBets,that wasnt what he recommended. he made the line -5.5 when the line closed -6.5 so he showed a 1-pt edge on tb
PikachuBets,plenty of good numbers last into the afternoon and if you're playing off screen tiny openers  daily fantasy sports  really matter that much
PikachuBets,"6/28 cfl week 3 #rougeball

PikachuBets,yeah doesn't really matter who it is anymore i just  daily fantasy sports  care to mansplain berry's antics anymore lol. no offense meant
PikachuBets,nah hes asking who can help him bet 40k bc apparently its tough to bet that much close to post on nba. /s
PikachuBets,"""brokedick"" is now my favorite #gamblingtwitter insult. get ready to see it used a lot in these coming weeks if you follow me"
PikachuBets,psa: every time . tweets about money its a down day/week for him. he just needs to make up the ego punch somehow...
PikachuBets,pop quiz how much is a half point worth in mlb vs nfl? go ahead i'll wait for you to google it np
PikachuBets,"announcement 

humbled and inspired by      and others i cant remember but they are all legit.

faq: 
peep the new acct  all details below"
PikachuBets,yes i am serious. cris is so reliable ppl keep humongous balances in there no problem. you won't ever have trouble cashing out.
PikachuBets,no value on baskonia cap'n. opened at -6.5/-7 now pretty much at efficiency. i'd lean the u161.5 if you must small edge there.

ToddFuhrman,this might be the most important lesson of all quite frankly have a game plan every single at bat and wait for yours

ToddFuhrman,spot on and we've seen it before everything goes right one weekend and then the well goes dry when you need it most
ToddFuhrman,-140 was my cut played some a shade lower but do think theres still opportunity there just maybe reduce the position a touch
TheCousinSal,bad job by espn here not replaying that burrow toss (and the hit he took) which was a top 5 pass this year.
TheCousinSal,congratulations to drew brees for setting the all-time record for  touchdown  passes without the aid of any spy cameras or papa johns pizza.
TheCousinSal,i couldnt get past the i was an editor at  at the age of 28 part.  hope it turned out ok for you.
TheCousinSal,theres absolutely nothing left to say about this epic federer/djokovic match. except that it had better not end in effing penalty kicks. #wimbledon2019
TheCousinSal,i think if england knew we were going to send them blake bortles and the a-hole yankees they wouldve tried harder in 1776.
TheCousinSal,this is so great and so terrible for me. ive already set up direct deposit.  essentially now has me working for free. gambling!
TheCousinSal,another great fight. max holloway absorbed literally hundreds of head strikes and still couldve won a close fight. poirier was phenomenal though. #ufc236
TheCousinSal,duke/mich st is a much more interesting matchup.  also blackshear stepped out of bounds with 5 seconds left. breaks go both ways. #marchmadness
TheCousinSal,cheer up travis. the dolphins just signed your boy fitzmagic.  hell suit up literally dozens of feet away from your 4th beach house.

12Xpert,error bars are almost always missing and where present are massively underestimated. we  daily fantasy sports  know what we  daily fantasy sports  know.
12Xpert,big teams will almost never be 3 so there's one problem to start with. sample will just be too small i would imagine.
12Xpert,a reminder that argumentum ad hominem is really the most distasteful way to debate and defend a point of view whilst critiquing anothers.
12Xpert,so here is part 2. do bookmaker's bias an nba spread market? hmmm i'm not sure. levitt's work might be out of date.
12Xpert,not by using the closing line clearly. in play is typically not something i indulge unless  it is  for a bit of fun.
12Xpert,absa-bloody-lutely. stick out the c-team. wolves are not a pushover and winning the premiership surely has to be considered more important for them.
12Xpert,as a general rule i think people who use gifs to make a statement on twitter should have painful things inflicted on them.

mschwimer,if you want sure. you can also buy as many 4 week packages as you want if you want to increase your bet.
mschwimer,you could very well be right. i have never claimed that pros bet our picks because i dont have access to that info.
mschwimer,great day in sports. jays win! uva sweeps florida st! somdev wins a doubles championship! jordan speith finishes top 10 at hilton head!
mschwimer,great start to the game... niners need to get some pressure in order to have a chance... need at least 1 big turnover.
mschwimer,i cant stand the nhl right now.  i have a huge problem with gary.  i might not watch hockey again because of him
mschwimer,my favorite songs of the concert were prove it all night promise land 41 shots 10th ave wrecking ball death to my hometown
mschwimer,my answer is i woudl go back to when i was 2 years old and id do everything with my left hand haha
mschwimer,after thinking more about uva's performance i would have to rank brandon kline's as the second most ballsyest outing in my memory behind
RufusPeabody,last spring schwimer told me he expected mlb to be a small winner but not to be nearly as strong as basketball.
RufusPeabody,i should have remembered that. jeff and i had dinner with both those guys that night. (see i can name drop too
RufusPeabody,gain from going to 8-2 less than loss going to 7-3 for seahawks. both teams should have been ok with a tie.

RufusPeabody,"the same poll but i used ""i"" and this isn't about me.  it is  trying to settle a debate with a friend."
RufusPeabody,im not bragging. i said i lost overall!! i do try to help others. i gave out woodland as a play on
RufusPeabody,over 49 percent  on against the spread markets on straight bets yes. what do you think the average bettor hits on those?
RufusPeabody,i get your point doug but you're quoting a very small sample size. what's the base rate over the last 10 years?
jeffma,who did i call an asshole? i dont think you are an asshole. but in your defense i have never met you
jeffma,latest episode of  where  acts as host and we do our best to follow up on a toutalicous 13-3 record last week
jeffma,here it is...  latest episode including  waxing philosophical on how ucf has no chance and how i jinxed our perfect college week
jeffma,congrats to the official team of the  podcast the san jose spartans and coach brent brennan for their first win as predicted!
jeffma,absolutely too short. thats my point also. but ultimately there needs to be some sort of results based judgment for any process
jeffma,anyone have a first hand report on the weather in philly? total is dropping so my guess is weather is looking dicey
jeffma,we are featuring  tomorrow on tout or sharp on the  podcast. would love any info on his picks recently... thanks in advance
jeffma,i cant wait for the day when there is no shock when a team goes for it on 4th down at midfield
jeffma,"i think there is something wrong with questioning the integrity of a sport and an individual with no evidence beyond ""why not"""
SportsCheetah,ulm going to miss a bowl thanks to missed pats against fsu and just now against ull as massive underdogs in each.
SportsCheetah,im ice today with wmu bakersfield and mavs so if you want a good late fade i bet col/clemson 2h under 70.
SportsCheetah,i mean the qb knows the play and where his guys are going it isn't like he has to wait and look
SportsCheetah,how monday night's pats-jets game shaped the market in week 8 + a few early line moves i agree and disagree with
SportsCheetah,rutgers qb johnny langan is 10-26 for 13 yards his last two games. that has to be a record of some sort.
SportsCheetah,bump. 5 trips inside miami 20. 2 inside the 5. also bryce has to toss that thing out of bounds mercy man.
SportsCheetah,man i was just trying to get some down in case ucla didn't scored again sweating +797 in a bunch of rrs
capjack2000,"6 percent  commission to retailers on every ticket written. 

when everyone is appalled at the lack of -110 in mt remember this."
capjack2000,"nearly 73x their wager. to put that in perspective... that is  like winning $18.22 on a $0.25 wager. 

congratulations on breaking even?"
capjack2000,we're 14 weeks in so i guess i should confess. i watch this on mute just to laugh at  reactions and faces.
capjack2000,...and if you can get this done in the next month i might still be able to make thanksgiving at the gouker's.
capjack2000,my saturation number is quite a bit higher...but yeah. contraction is coming this spring. dge fortunately has experience in spinning contraction positively.
capjack2000,according to him  it is  the operator who is choosing this. all the kambi operators are choosing the same risk management strategy...independently.
capjack2000,i'm sure they'll adapt to what is offered typically on us sports. it'll be interesting to see how they approach the market.
capjack2000,"in honor of the state what's better than a jersey prop:

capjack2000,to be honest i'd rather play against 49 humans than 49 dogs. dogs aren't going to fall for the usual tournament fallacies.

dinkinc,a tough day for hazel and her owner.... starting rehab for her was difficult... starting rehab for me was even more so..
dinkinc,i would go to a fortune teller for that info.  i use the one in coney island across the street from nathans
dinkinc,one should be better than the other. choose.  also it is a commonly used measure to catch up on a losing record
dinkinc,2-1 for the  horses and the loss was a heartbreaking one.  a winning day is fine but this one had its downside
dinkinc,our country wants us to be heard so changes can be made fir the better. she has a platform to be heard.
dinkinc,we can do a full board parlay using the following pitchers...... alzolay..houser.. allen..sparkman..eshelman and suarez....  likely not the best of ideas ....
dinkinc,he blocked me too but he has improved a ton and is great on interviews. he is more critical of things now
robpizzola,if the patriots win the super bowl ill buy a pair of sergio rossi shoes and eat them on a live periscope.
robpizzola,thanks knish. means a lot coming from a guy that sees all the angles but doesnt have the balls to play them.
robpizzola,find me a spot where i can parlay redskins exactly 0 points with raiders exactly 0 points and i might bet it.
robpizzola,would have came last time but  was nearly in tears when i told him i might not have time for italian food.
robpizzola,really wish bennys mother could have made the trip tonight but times are tough with her having to pay his student debt.
robpizzola,i watched it but never thought it was great. it certainly had its moments but not considered a top show for me.
RASPicks,no one has been better in short or long term.  get week 1 college football picks from ras free just sign-up here:
RASPicks,anyone betting enough to create significant closing line value would eventually run out of money (or lose their following) if not winning.
RASPicks,human error on the one release caused page to not display pick e-mail went out fine.  we graded it 1/2 point less.
RASPicks,ras  college basketball  sides l/2 years: 164-101 61.9 percent  +58.75 units against gameday widely available -110 lines and 100 percent  transparent recordkeeping.#letsgo
RASPicks,when jimmy had ref in pocket he was beating the close.  when ras isn't beating close you can say we lost edge.
RASPicks,the quality of opening line is determined more by the close than the score.  even the adjusted line at half was -8.
RASPicks,they are a portion of our portfolio.  not going to apologize for them.  they have a bigger market than  college basketball  totals.
RASPicks,it is important in both sports but value of each 1/2 point is more consistent in hoops.  more key numbers in fb.
RASPicks,college football / college basketball  have avg +46 units per year last 3.  just $87 per unit would break even at $4k.
RASPicks,daily fantasy sports  know nfl market well enough to answer that but i do think preseason is more beatable than regular season.
RASPicks,if you hit 60 percent  in nfl and  college football  and beat the close for multiple years you could name your price.

VegasRefund,not data to confirm this but id assume if he won mvp it would hurt his chances to get comeback poy too.
VegasRefund,for what  it is  worth  bakers odds to be picked first started to implode the day of the draft last year too.
VegasRefund,no marquee sports tonight. makes you realize how spoiled weve been over the past couple of years by having multiple game 5s.
VegasRefund,"a: hey wanna join my fantasy football league?

VegasRefund,"jarvis is real.
baker is a tv star.
i have hope for josh gordon.
this hard knocks is gonna to be great."
ProfessorShine,since nfl is all about betting now maybe give an extra draft pick for beating ones closing season win totals.  im half-serious.
ProfessorShine,also why has dan rafael blocked so many people? are mass trolls bothering him somehow? he writes about boxing and crushes buffets.
ProfessorShine,plus action network and other info sites that are really sales corps help to make buyers more unsophisticated on a daily basis.
ProfessorShine,the march madness site used to have a boss screen that brings up a fake spreadsheet over the live stream of games.
suuma810,"week 16 recap:

the vikings destroyed what could have been a great week. on to week 17 and the playoffs!"

suuma810,road teams off a bye week are 86-60-2 against the spread (58.9 percent ) since 2010. 9-3-1 against the spread this season.
suuma810,not involved but titans/bills is one of those games where we all might say why didnt we bet the titans in hindsight.
suuma810,i made my pick without knowing whether he will play. hes a bonus. expect him to be on a snap count .
suuma810,agree but that would put stress on every ol. the pats line is improved from last year with the upgrade at lt.
suuma810,wish you the best as well bud  let us  get them! btw listening to the podcast right now great job once again
ClevTA,you are making major leaps here so not sure i understand the point. so nevermind back to stugotz and his bowl season
ClevTA,its amazing. ppl cant comprehend it. they are so ingrained with what theyve been taught their whole life even though its incorrect
ClevTA,shuhei for sushi but pure asian food hunan coventry is hands down the best chinese in the city of u ask me
ClevTA,whoa u like anthony lynn? felt like they won totally in spite of him last year. i think hes bottom 10 hc
ClevTA,welp i hit the same teaser an hour ago. also indy/zona. watt strip sack to win by 10 on the way lol
ClevTA,im 14-3 against the spread on all gms this year involving mac schools 6-1 in midweek maction. lot of mac brain power
ClevTA,back to winning ways on  thursday night football . hopefully i dont have to back this crappy skins team again this year
ClevTA,i really cant imagine dorsey watching that game last night and not doing something about the left tackle situation before the deadline
ClevTA,when u are throwing in traffic at the gl u always throw it low on purpose. that was a perfectly fine throw
ClevTA,what ive been waiting for. me and  been banging this drum since preseason. do what got u there in the first place
ClevTA,that arizona final score was misleading 2 missed  field goal s + a flukey tipped pick 6. wasnt a bad handicap tbh
ClevTA,quick  thursday night football  preview with some random matchup numbers. also my against the spread pick in case you missed it earlier.
ClevTA,the initial re open in a couple spots was 6.5 but that quickly evaporated to 7 -120. 7.5 in a few spots
CizzlingSports,after  got crushed his first year selling picks he told all us dum dums that he of course only bets for fun
CizzlingSports,"well except for the prevailing party attorneys' fees and costs provision.

you still need to provide notice unless of course nothing matters."
CizzlingSports,lmao now provide you are thoughts on the deal great negotiator randy cut with  and  fyi randy's opening demand was $10m. thanks.
CizzlingSports,this is incredible 1) on the merits; and 2) that # worst of all time   threw shade at this man like this

spanky,i was also diamond.  i had double limits and it went down to shits . $10000 nba sides became $500 nba sides
spanky,i believe this to be true for every form of betting.  there are talkers and there are bettors.  both sets rarely overlap
spanky,agreed...buying through the 1 for 15 cents is a borderline move in the regular season but a great move come tournament time
spanky,i had the pleasure of meeting  this year at sloan. not only is ed super intelligent but hes a real nice guy.
spanky,wont surprise me that the 2 is very strong particularly in the tourney... however i would always lay -1 instead of pk-20
spanky,i understand your point. i just dont understand how betting both sides of the same game is an act of laundering money....
spanky,on the contrary! i have the respect of evey offshore sportsbook and i know all the owners personally.  pipe down young man....
spanky,i spent most of my day sitting on a toilet trying to overcome the shits. thanks for keeping me company twitter heads.

spanky,yes they treated me very fairly.  nothing but good things to say about those guys. i wish they would expand to jersey
DocBettor,my favorite thing about this blackjack hand is that if it was +ev going in the next hand is probably still +ev
DocBettor,how many lakers does it take to get the ball to the biggest guy on the court in the post? #houvslal #lakeshow
DocBettor,closed 57.5 and would've landed 57 if not for a meaningless quinn cook 3 with 0.2 left so score one for clv?
DocBettor,can get celts at a better price now after that svi mykhailiuk heave at the 3rd quarter buzzer if you're into it
DocBettor,nice. i'm on alonso +400 to win it all alonso -165 over santana 1st round acuna +170 over bell 1st round #homerunderby
PlusEVAnalytics,so ridiculous.  must work on his obsession problem then go to a good old fashioned opera with a friend. chill francesco chill!
PlusEVAnalytics,ok now what if and hear me out the path was bye followed by home against tennessee followed by home against kc?
PlusEVAnalytics,a website that reviews kids toys according to how clear and easy to follow the assembly instructions are. theres a wide range.
PlusEVAnalytics,thats not true. its confusing because the construction of the problem is unusual - its rejecting the deal that is the gamble.
PlusEVAnalytics,now its up to jason garrett on the road with negative closing line value to salvage my supercontest hopes. god help me.
PlusEVAnalytics,cool. seems like a difficult thing to model. id love to hear your method dm me if youre ever willing to share!
PlusEVAnalytics,but if i had 500 results with 3 percent  roi on 5 percent  theoretical edge id be closer to 60 percent  kelly.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh yeah the degens will totally consider the moral implications of supporting hypocrisy before they feed their welfare $ into these machines
PlusEVAnalytics,would be a shame...in any other year canadian sports media would go mike weir level of bananas this year nobody will gaf
PlusEVAnalytics,of course the kid probably meant im not a boy im a big man but people hear what they want to hear
PlusEVAnalytics,small play on under +106 in the rangers game today and mid sized play on under -115 in the dallas game tomorrow.
PlusEVAnalytics,doesnt matter whether the rankings are algorithmic human driven or a combination of both - the (poorly defined) question remains the same
aluckyaday,recreational betting is not supposed to be appetizing to professional bettors. neither the state or the recreational bookmakers want or need them.
aluckyaday,do you pay for the rodgers breakfast data or is it publically available? i fancy using it in my next moneyline model.
aluckyaday,i thought the big syndicates get rebates so they are always betting +ev in the pools? its the public that get screwed?
aluckyaday,not often a local operation can take on huge global corporations and win through personality. maybe in america guess time will tell.
aluckyaday,so how long a period? how many wins in that period? what kind of return? just a gut feeling? or something measurable?
aluckyaday,not unless you delete your account or become pro in a different sport. but our point is tips should never be deleted.
aluckyaday,aren't we all  easier to hit the bullseye in financial markets as the mean tends to be the right side of zero.
aluckyaday,if boris hangs around for any time they will probably have to rename it though. pmdnaq. prime minister does not answer questions.
aluckyaday,i know we are saying the same thing really. its not the predictions that are wrong but the way they are presented.
aluckyaday,the business has changed a lot recently. not much bookmaking going on in europe. marketing is now the name of the game!
aluckyaday,you are someone who can not hold down an argument so has to resort to insulting someone who they know nothing about!
aluckyaday,i think the 20 wins in a row was just used to show how it works rather than something that normally happens.
aluckyaday,full results here . minimum stake of 10 (why not 1? ) and what seems to be random increases for certain bets.
aluckyaday,is it partly because of these bookmaker shades that allow most sharps to profit? or is it always done within the margin?
aluckyaday,you must be getting old! in the good old days you would get out of the car straight in to a gig!
joeytunes2,20  years ago. i was interviewed for the price is right. i didnt make the cut but very vocal in the audience.
joeytunes2,349 +9.5 (cris)   sdsu not sure i saw enough to lay 9.5 with ucla. i know there 22-0 or something against sdsu.

joeyisaks,wowwzz hes legit only reason i am on twitter . i need a new fake news source who u recommend twitter fam!!?
joeyisaks,heres to hoping cody gets names mvp today. good luck cody. was 34-1.  pic not posted is trevor bauer cy young bet
joeyisaks,i had 1h under 33 so wanted no  touchdown  but come on.. he 100 percent  got the ball back and had possesion
EdMillerPoker,hey good luck on your future work. if we can be a resource for you to these ends please let me know.
EdMillerPoker,in-play football (esp college) during the 2021 season will be a v opportunity imo. v enough id start learning the ropes now.
EdMillerPoker,how does a public company lose a third of its value on news reported six months ago  it is  all very silly
EdMillerPoker,start with a responsible gaming pr campaign warning against paying for picks. go after the high price tag bc that will resonate.
EdMillerPoker,the whole atbat-by-atbat baseball betting thing tho...  daily fantasy sports  think that one's gonna just fall into place like these folks think
EdMillerPoker,wonder how much the flight of good people from bad culture companies to good culture companies is worth. bet its a lot.
EdMillerPoker,i think mit has sent me more emails in the past two weeks than they had in the 20 years before that
EdMillerPoker,ah  it is  sit out back in the morning with my coffee and my dog weather again. my favorite time of year.
EdMillerPoker,l. jackson freeman d. williams odb cooks watkins kelce hyde trubisky n'keal harry fant and the guys i posted before 12-team 0.5ppr
EdMillerPoker,dont know probably i dont want to know their names the ppl who try to make a name for themselves this way
EdMillerPoker,a good political argument i guess is one that makes you forget for a second that someones naked self-interest is behind it
EdMillerPoker,in general would expect parlays to be more popular on avg in places without mobile due to increased friction to place bets
EdMillerPoker,dont think many good conclusions can be drawn from nv market looking forward. it was and is a very strange petri dish.
EdMillerPoker,the flexible thing is key. signing a long-term contract with a single operator almost has to be wrong from the state's perspective.
EdMillerPoker,results so far done nothing to put me off my thesis that a sufficiently superior product will win market share v quickly
EdMillerPoker,yeah the highish buyin combined with intense time commitment and required travel makes this seem like a pretty niche product to me
GolcondaFund,how is dealing with family/hurricane aftermath going to affect players coaches tw? texans got toasted. jags next? even to open + bortles..
nonrandomalpha,not trying to call bottoms and will continue to nibble this coming friday. blood is in the streets baby. thanks for checking-in
nonrandomalpha,here's a time-series of performance over the course of the 2019 season.  nfl core sportfolio consistently outperforming week-over-week demonstrating our risk-adjusted approach.
nonrandomalpha,i like it. raw. pissed and frustrated that theyre losing even beyond the initial moment. nothing worse than casual acceptance of losing.
nonrandomalpha,i said i liked their stuff and that rjs stories suck. apologies for offending you. we can end it here. good evening.
nonrandomalpha,i think the line closes higher than it is today but id def take -110 that this like does not hit -30
nonrandomalpha,do any bears fans think the bears will lose any games - or they will just blow everybody out every game? lol
nonrandomalpha,i could careless about anyone besides us - and we looked like sh*t and should have lost to a true frosh qb.
nonrandomalpha,lafleur has explicitly said that he wants the offense to be supported by the run - so id imagine that trend continues.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm really curious where this come from now. it almost makes me think they had a really low number of seasons simulated.
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah i just never added that level of granularity to the model. it doesn't come up until around well week 16 :p
LeeSharpeNFL,i expected the bears to regress this year though this was definitely on the low end of the expectation distribution for sure.
LeeSharpeNFL,"bears kick a field goal on 4th and 6 on the 9 down 21-3.

.... what is the point of doing that?"
LeeSharpeNFL,sorry  it is  not working for you! are you getting that error when trying to call the function or define the function?
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm calculating the string distance and filtering on that.  it is  a low tolerance though i'm preferring false negatives to false positives.
LeeSharpeNFL,still early but if eagles can pull this out the nfl analytics twitter ravens will hold the 1st seed in the afc.
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is an incredible statistic.

also the video linked to in the tweet above this is good and i would recommend it."
whale_capper,gsw comes out a winner and we forget that ever happened (and the next two years of nba are 10x more enjoyable)
whale_capper,wow... dont think i can remember afc getting full saturday and nfc sunday before... what game does the #1 cbs crew get?
whale_capper,brad has gotten the better of me a number of times already this season so it is very much cause for concern
whale_capper,would line has thoracic outlet syndrome yes at -200... theyd be handing the division to no if they put him back in
whale_capper,the market is a little quiet early in the week cant totally explain it... would guess kc closes at 7 maybe 7.5
whale_capper,took me a while to figure it out but he's talking rank out of 32 in each and 23.5 is fairly sharp
whale_capper,while im sure this applies across sports the small sample size blowing up the uncertainty for rsw in football is wildly underpriced
whale_capper,most of the misfit from average numbers was to put the book in an advantage spot relative to a 3 or 7
whale_capper,can't find a suitor for him in the top 18 the couple that were floated were smoke from what i can tell
AndyMSFW,nope the back of the line gets to be the front in this case.  new line turns it into a snake draft.
AndyMSFW,imagine watching your running scheme truck down the field like that and then kicking a  field goal  on 4th and a whisker
AndyMSFW,"tin foil hat time:
coaches are getting kick-backs to challenge pi because  it is  a bonus commercial break. follow the money sheeple!"
AndyMSFW,i am not a zoologist but it did say that it was a tail on the package from the crappy halloween store
AndyMSFW,i'm not even really sure what this means. is it for a fish made of fish or simply shaped like a fish?
AndyMSFW,plays so far.  gonna add some t20/t10/3ball/godknowswhatelse tomorrow.  honestly shocked that i made it this far and never used  as a backdrop.

JoeyKnish22,also through 2 games grier looked like a welfare version of nathan peternan so kyle allen looks like dan marino right now.

JoeyKnish22,my name better be engraved somewhere in this dump especially since ive yet to receive any buffet comps after dropping 7 racks
JoeyKnish22,im declaring war on circa. no peace treaty. we dont stop until they close the doors. (or at least fire the matts).
JoeyKnish22,under 51 (large). over 45. akron running hurry up for a garbage time  touchdown  against emu walk ons to kill the middle
JoeyKnish22,just to be clear. this is depicting you guys battling for who wants to be better friends and bet with knish yes?
JoeyKnish22,somebody grab my phone and smash it on the ground before i bet another umass team total. youve got like 7 minutes.
JoeyKnish22,i see what you did there well lets hope the pokes can steele a cover this week over the very surprising tcu.
JoeyKnish22,"first the tomlin challenge loss streak ends.

JoeyKnish22,i thought the weekday sun belt officiating crew was of the highest quality and called it right down the middle per usual
JoeyKnish22,lot of places savy enough to pull him off but bridgewater unders should be real solid looks if you can find em.

LockyLockerson,would have had sean mcdermott in the mix if they could've won yesterday still think  it is  possible if they beat ne.

LockyLockerson,has anything come out about the players yet? like how are spectators allowed on the grounds based on all this updated info?
LockyLockerson,8pm guest also maybe someone you are probably familiar with whose only kind of someone im insanely excited to talk to wooooooo
LockyLockerson,this is not a sarcastic question: if pitchers had a choice would they rather pitch on normal rest or the 10 days?
LockyLockerson,ok ill jump on the #girldad bandwagon.  made this last fathers day cant wait to keep adding to it thru the years.
LockyLockerson,ok rockets please  daily fantasy sports  do what you've done in every 2nd half for the last couple weeks.  thanks in advance.
LockyLockerson,maybe hes played out or lame at this point but man i still really love gritty.  makes me laugh basically every time.

EliHershkovich,dante is exactly what they missed. love walker's energy but him okoro and lawson can't finish with their back to the basket.
EliHershkovich,valid point but they've also struggled to close out games. not banking on penny and this team's inexperience in a one--done scenario.
EliHershkovich,"excited to host  tonight with  6-10 pm est. lots of  college football /nfl/ college basketball  ()/nba to hit.

EliHershkovich,"i'll be producing all week  hosting with  on friday. download the  app in the meantime.

DannyParkins,awesome play by lauri on the hustle after dunns hilarious runner. he hit that huge corner 3 and forgot who he was.
DannyParkins,a big offensive play that showed both a high football iq and poise is such a welcome surprise. it felt genuinely new.
DannyParkins,um... ben roethlisberger in effect makes $45 million. matt ryan makes $44.75 million. the next highest is russell wilson at $35 million.
DannyParkins,whats the maximum number of sauces or condiments you can reasonably have on a sandwich/burger without losing the integrity of said sandwich/burger?
DannyParkins,white sox ratings are up 41 percent  on nbc chicago year over year tied for 2nd best increase in baseball this year.
DannyParkins,im ashamed we had to outsource this job to a floridian. cmon chicago were better than this. long live chance the snapper!
DannyParkins,elite coaching by vermont choosing not to foul and take care of their +8.5 gambling public down 7 with 14 seconds left
DannyParkins,this is great insight. all bulls fans and frankly all of us in media who comment on them should read both parts.
DannyParkins,from the national show my favorite 56 mj stories in 23 minutes or less on his 56th birthday inspired by  ... podcast:
DannyParkins,always love talking to  he agreed to be the official film critic of the  going forward whenever we wanna review a movie!
chadmillman,only  could pitch this idea last night in slack and have it ready to share with you this morn. a thanksgiving gift.
chadmillman,huge day in american history today. no not the sondland testimony. i found a legit reason to bet the j-e-t-s! (free story)
chadmillman,click button at bottom to choose your sport (nfl nba etc.). props are now an option at top of each sport page
chadmillman,will paul george have more than 3.5 assists? aka one more reason to watch okc-golden state tonight from  and the  props tool.
chadmillman,if you feel like something's been off when betting the nfl this season you're right (unless you're a very savvy fade-the-public player).
chadmillman,this is who im picking so far today. if i lose unm  and i will be reimbursed for pain and suffering by
chadmillman,here we go! bookmaker-to-the-world bob scucci  i together again for nfl week 1 +  drops in. hooray for the new podcast  football!
chadmillman,wildly inappropriate and funny nearly cringeworthy a couple of times. will make you wonder what we made  take out of her story.
chadmillman,multiple laugh-out-loud moments in this column from  but mostly an expansion of her hate betting theory with reckless disregard for her bankroll.
chadmillman,at last recording new  in our  studio.  brings classic stories including winning $15k as a 12 year old. up soon (nice pic
chadmillman,no you dont. you like it just the right amount if not enough. everyone else can too by listening to the podcast
chadmillman,good question: percentages are based on volume of bets until kickoff from several sports books we work with in vegas and offshore.
chadmillman,i know all the talk next week will be about cowboys-eagles or raiders-pats. but im most looking forward to vikes-rams. too soon?
chadmillman,15 minutes of fun in new pod. mattress mack the bettor who had millions on astros in world series shares his story

chadmillman,yes. apologies.   hey dude - years old podcast shows as 55 sec long on itunes.  can you get someone to fix that?!
Gingfacekillah,looks like the whole world is on the ducks and the capitals today. which away dog is likely to steal a game?
Gingfacekillah,one thing that popped out was time spent in the offensive zone would probably be decent indicator of a teams latent strength.
Gingfacekillah,i think so yes. working on a principal component analysis of one of my models atm just thought id pass this on.
Gingfacekillah,joel embiid vs orl tonight. over rebounds under assit points pts/reb/ast. trying to thread the needle here but i like it. bol.
Gingfacekillah,when you get spammed by a tout service but try to help em out anyways...2 point line move against your lock fellas...lol
Gingfacekillah,178 after 3 qs. going to need someone to get cold to get this under. currently projected to hit at least 228.
Gingfacekillah,i did some light analysis of this one night a while back. this is the distribution of winners for the canadian 6/49:
logan_matthews9,id definitely rather have kemba then those three which is the better comparison (since thats what the cs get instead of kyrie)
logan_matthews9,i dont think we can call it rest when its a knockout game. shes not fully fit bench (yes this is semantics)
logan_matthews9,kim you cant just go putting the best 11 players on the field at the same time it doesnt work like that
logan_matthews9,thanks man! yeah im getting great looks at lines but it hasnt completely translated yet. profitable season ahead for both of us
PikachuBets,"what kind of ""knee injury"" does seth towns have that takes 2+ years for it to heal on an otherwise healthy 21-year-old?"
PikachuBets,after jamming himself on that jumbo dick the way he did i'm sure he's just drowning in semen rn and can't respond
PikachuBets,he's one of the very few who actually makes his living betting sports himself instead of selling plays but go on man
PikachuBets,i actually very much agree with this. marking w/l early on a sheet is the real hallmark of the potential reverse jinx
PikachuBets,even now he still feels a raging need to brag and tell the world about how good he is at golf  #byefelicia
PikachuBets,no lie the first one i saw was pikachu. ugh i knew it i was made for myself man i love myself
PikachuBets,iirc from his tweet history he's probably retweeting and sucking the semen off of some twitter tout's fire nhl locks or something
adamchernoff,"vikings now with just two cbs to take on the saints.

combined passer rating against waynes and rhodes is 111 this season..."
adamchernoff,"some interesting replies...

kc as low as -3.5 and as high as -10.5 vs ne. bal as high as -13.5 vs hou."
adamchernoff,i would  but joey isnt a nice person. sucks that he is associated in this episode with some of my fav guys.
adamchernoff,how many playoff games did andy reid win or lose with the 52 players on the team this year in the past?
adamchernoff,thats interesting. do you see any mass market appeal if the model is done right and offers constant buying/selling opportunities in play?
adamchernoff,backing washington can be...daunting. but they happen to match up extremely well against carolina in what should be a low variance game.
adamchernoff,"doing  with the fantastic  and  in a couple of minutes to talk nfl week 9...(i think). 

tune in for some football talk."
adamchernoff,it was there but i go pretty subtle with ribs though. did these on maple logs so it burned really clean throughout.
adamchernoff,video form looks at the total as well. breakdown begins at the 2 minute mark with myself and  looking at the total.
adamchernoff,rudely i have not asked for your take on this. where do you stand on things? too far not enough just right?
adamchernoff,could explain the stomach issues i am having...even if i did eat that it was probably delicious and filled with amazing flavours.
Ccon8181,why does #oklahoma hate putting trans away?? only team that can dominate but would rather shit themselves late... against the spread #oklavsosu
Ccon8181,"for those that bet #mlb .. not counting this in my records.. just a little something im on:

#nationals +102

#worldseries2019 #houvswsh"
Ccon8181,on this #mlb play.. not for the fund just personally. not part of the record didnt release prior to first pitch. #stlvsatl

Ccon8181,whew dodged ot.. big time #thunder collapse but got the w.. now i can check the end of this #knightup #nhlplayoffs game.
Ccon8181,so underwhelming... #superbowl .. congrats to the pats on the win and cover. rams had the better talent but lacked heart imo
Ccon8181,no surprising as theyve eliminated the ppl who would be buying back on the rams +2.5 forcing them to move to -3
Ccon8181,gawd damn refs even trying to hook up the #browns and they still give up a 3rd and 19. cmon man #kcvscle
Ccon8181,hate to be so bullish on a harden team... but in all seriousness #houstonrockets are a strong strong side tonight imo. #houvsgsw
Ccon8181,id like to see more transparency. some ppl treat it more than entertainment and especially if leagues want an integrity fee.should disclose
Ccon8181,never fails!! fucking brutal. olidipo doesnt do shit but loves padding stats with bullshit last second shots. #cavs couldve put em away
Ccon8181,"right side good value but lets see if james throws in towel to start the ego driven offseason.

#cavaliers -5.5 -110 

#nbaplayoffs"
Ccon8181,no excuses. bad read. took the l. teams have been doing this for years to get an extra bid in the tournament.
Ccon8181,"contrarian investments llc is invested in:

#ucla #bruins -7 -115 risking 5.5 percent

#coni"
Ccon8181,"contrarian investments llc is invested in: 

#michiganstate #spartans -4 -110 risking 5.5 percent  

didn't get the best number on this one. #coni"
Ccon8181,not saying you werebut i believe  it is  good practiceshould be the standardif we're going to advise we should have skin risked
Ccon8181,no coincidence when the books struggled we struggled.took a beating going against pats backing browns jags etc.cream will rise to the top
Ccon8181,"not enough volume to register as a play for the fund but like the side. #freepicks 

#boisestate -28.5

Ccon8181,#ucla qb rosen set the tone by pulling himself for the game. guy has cost me multiple times. was already locked in...
Ccon8181,reality is real ppl are making real $ being invested.. not to mention i've helped set the market for cg. win win
Ccon8181,i'm not sure if intent plays a part in the rule. i wouldn't mind if they got rid of the rule altogether.
Ccon8181,last summer you had on quinton of cgtechnologies. at the time they had sports funds in talks. contrarian investments llc is here
Ccon8181,exactly january was brutal i own it. but can't expect to win every month. ended up right where i expect to be.
Ccon8181,currently outperforming all 20 of the largest mutual funds y touchdown  closest is at +5.5 percent  with 7 currently in the red...
Ccon8181,phone had no service. emailed the play but couldn't tweet it.. on #pistons +6 .. documented but won't count it in records.
kellyinvegas,an hour maybe. look at the sharp/square books. pretty easy. its more about how much do i weigh that into my opinion.
kellyinvegas,12-2-1 prior to monday night. loser on vikings 12-3-1 =16 weeks. this is week 17. thatll be $50 for the math lesson.
kellyinvegas,told me a respected sharp group played hawaii +2 last week so i tailed. outside of that no opinion on the game.
kellyinvegas,only do money line parlays. 3 teams. my 3 fav i also bet moneyline by themselves plus single against the spread tickets.
ToddFuhrman,"what's your gambling resolution for 2020?

(no it can't be to make more money  that is  always our goal in this business)"
ToddFuhrman,the tax liability more than made up by marketing upside.  no doubt a business man this savvy has covered all his bases
ToddFuhrman,mike...please  daily fantasy sports  encourage payne eating more lara bars while we record; hard enough keeping him honest with bathroom breaks ha
ToddFuhrman,its all about buyouts; if a team wants you bad enough pay me the transfer fee for him otherwise youre staying put
ToddFuhrman,as we recorded this podcast i was thinking one loyal listener is going to absolutely love that his game made the cut...
ToddFuhrman,"when they invite you on theherd and dress you as twins...

hey thecousinsal open your damn eyes!

 credit  at fox studio lot"
ToddFuhrman,with kevin durants upgrade now official weve see the raptors go from -3 to a consensus +1 out here in the desert
ToddFuhrman,"i've heard interviews with tyreek hill before...

i'll offer 5000-1 to anyone that wants to believe that he actually texts like this"
ToddFuhrman,bingo and after investing in the show for so many years didnt want to see major storylines resolved in such a manner
ToddFuhrman,33 degrees and snow in the desert my man! ive grown soft since leaving chicago had to keep the dome warm haha
TheCousinSal,taking in the wonderful sights and smells of soldier field. my pre-game pick (7-2 this year) in just a few minutes on
TheCousinSal,how about this: lsu clemson and ohio state play a three week double elimination tournament? im not really interested in anyone else.
TheCousinSal,congrats  you scored 29 runs and swept your arch rivals in london. doesnt get better than that. you should definitely consider staying.
TheCousinSal,im not saying last nights episode was predictable but at one point one of the dragons was caught rolling its eyes. #gameofthrones
TheCousinSal,"gronk was the greatest
gronk this
gronk that
blah blah blah
now lets all please focus our energy on rooting against duke."
TheCousinSal,"mark it down - january 20th 2019.  the day the nfl turned into the nba...
is it a foul?
is it not?"
TheCousinSal,there is no way youre going to convince that alabama (up 28-0) didnt cover the 14 pt. spread tonight. dont even try.
TheCousinSal,this josh johnson/blaine gabbert matchup is making it so much easier for football fans to get their last minute christmas shopping done.
TheCousinSal,i never thought id see it...the chiefs blew a game inside a minute left in regulation and it wasnt andy reids fault.
TheCousinSal,vic beasleys goalpost stuff in stride after a 74 yard fumble return has to go down as the greatest dunk ever. #ravensfalcons
TheCousinSal,the good news is when russia wins the world cup a team will finally agree to pay a white house visit to
TheCousinSal,ive been meaning to tell you this all weekend...the rockets -11 is a mortal lock. also your mother misses you. call her.
TheCousinSal,my best bet of the year (atl) was a winner thanks to a good luck punch in the nuts by the great
TheCousinSal,"hue jackson to gm: ""i can get this team up for exactly one game a year. now how about that extension?"" #browns"
TheCousinSal,watch as i gloat after an undefeated week 12 - then stick around for a chance to win a trip to vegas
12Xpert,no really big priced win like norwich. best was versus everton at 5.31. but they are 6th on the over/under achievement table.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  offer tables week by week but technically you can construct them yourself fairly quickly if you're handy with excel.
12Xpert,if you can then that implies that closing prices arent fully efficient at least for the sample matches you are betting on.
12Xpert,does alexander zverev have dirt on the atp president? every week i check the rankings he's still 3rd despite being complete rubbish.
JambosPicks,picks are in. sign up at  and purchase a package to see our recommended plays today and the rest of the week!
JambosPicks,the #gators capitalize on a #canes turnover to take a 17-13 lead and our  moneyline play is gonna be a 4th quarter
mschwimer,literally every single subscriber except the solo week 2 subs would be winning right now after our payback. those are the facts.
mschwimer,i have literally not heard a single reason from you. if so many are out there can you just name 1 please?
mschwimer,wow. i used to see jake arrietta in austin during the off season. that is not a man you want to cross.
mschwimer,still waiting for evidence on this. if you are going to make a claim you should be able to back it up.
mschwimer,it is  not good that i genuinely  daily fantasy sports  know if donald trump made vern the ambassador of sweden or not.
mschwimer,if you are serious about baseball and want the best glove possible.  go to .co/ggdamichwj and read up.  this is no joke
mschwimer,couldn't be more disappointed in the true detective season finale. such a deep show reduced to a simple light vs dark theme
mschwimer,"so glad i got to see   mlb debut... took a no hitter into the 7th. finished with a 8inning shutout win.
#saiditfromday1"
mschwimer,""" day off and can't sleep in for anything. well breakfast it is."" i was just gonna tweet this exact same thing"
mschwimer,its unanimous. every person said they would still be a phillies fan... so i dont wanna hear anymore flyers conversion attempts... c-a-p-s
mschwimer,catching up on all the shows i missed... with 4 eps left breaking bad is hitting the fan... modern fam is hilarious
mschwimer,sidenote... when dubee told me i was gonna start after the rain delay i read  mailbag to try to calm the nerves
RufusPeabody,if youre the seahawks would you rather lose tonight and play at philly or win the division and host the vikings?
RufusPeabody,youve obviously had a similar experience to many other sharps in new jersey. i was talking about betting the blatant mistakes.
RufusPeabody,"was just trying to come up with a way to frame some of this for discussion. some insight into the ""why"""
RufusPeabody,agree. and i hope  doesn't think i'm attacking him here. i know he's very cognizant of his effect on the market.
RufusPeabody,underrated part of modeling sports -- finding klugey solutions. the data is never perfect. thinking creatively and finding work-arounds is essential.
RufusPeabody,yes. i honestly think the most valuable trait i have is my resiliency. losing has always motivated me to work harder.
RufusPeabody,nah that was me and marco on gill's podcast a number of years ago but that part of it was cut.
RufusPeabody,hot take: the #1 issue holding back recreational gamblers is *not* bankroll management.  it is  placing negative positive expected value bets.
RufusPeabody,nowhere in dks statement or your article does it say she will receive no money. where are you getting that from?
jeffma,to all of you who fly  middle seat in economy plus or window seat in second to last row of plane?
jeffma,with the draft fast approaching the better half of  (sorry  waxes philosophical on the lessons behavioral science can teach nfl teams
jeffma,i think tim duncan would be more effective than lamarcus in this series. la seems like he's 31 going on 40
jeffma,ha ha. okay. no reason to get mad. you are a great writer but should probably stick to stuff you understand
jeffma,i'm talking about the tech part. u can't use terms like ai or moneyline unless you understand how to explain them
jeffma,in your method to calculate implied odds of heads coming up we would add up all out comes and get 1.17
jeffma,i gave the over out on my podcast during brady's rookie year. had to make the over -130 to get action
jeffma,nah. bad move. closers are overrated. kimbrel's best years are behind him and you give up guys you can control. #wreaksofoldschool
jeffma,thanks to all the #sasgf15 participants for getting up early and listening to me!!! see you all in vegas next year!!!
jeffma,barkley just said the two stats he looks at are turnovers and rebounds. wonder if realizes that he just used analytics
SportsCheetah,just because kelly's review of your podcast appearance wasn't as enamoring doesn't mean we need to take it out on steven.
SportsCheetah,seth curry scoring 23 off of the bench in a half probably not going to win anybody many unders very often
SportsCheetah,didnt get to watch tonight but he was great on the local nets broadcast last week sometime when he was on
SportsCheetah,i feel like continually running the ball on that drive is somewhere around not taking a 2-for-1 down a bucket late.
SportsCheetah,you mean you didnt like that they were trying to get the run game going on the final drive down 3?
SportsCheetah,with the wind and weather picking up in ohio i just middled back on the akron/bg total for anybody following these.
SportsCheetah,"great coverage of the events from last night:

im riding with him: it was time for karl-anthony towns to fight back"
SportsCheetah,just saw this from nfl next gen stats: baker mayfield is 1-for-21 passing on scramble rollouts to the right this season.
SportsCheetah,sickest part is as unlikely as it is la tech scoring there is the only way fiu can win the game.
capjack2000,"i should have known something was up when this guy told me to bet the ""decision by tko in the 4th"""
capjack2000,still has a better track record than the approach of being so vitriolic that the common man immediately disregards your opinion.
capjack2000,never wage a land war in russia in the winter and never doubt  knowledge of the history of the offshore industry.
capjack2000,"live from #g2e :
heres a cool product from igt. watch the game and live bet on-screen (others have similar products)."
capjack2000,"should read good ol captain jack. 

the irony is i still think this is negative expected value at this number. deeply."
capjack2000,conspicuously absent from all foxbet promos is  i'm guessing a lingering clause of a non-compete from his days behind the counter?
capjack2000,"wow...just wow. regulators need better counsel. 

"" daily fantasy sports  stand in the doorway  daily fantasy sports  block up the hall."""
capjack2000,the opposite. makes me want to sell education to those who recognize the futility of picks but want to learn more.
capjack2000,he's got a point  the legal sportsbooks in the us are more reliant on the offshore books than their customers are.
capjack2000,he's standing out on the boardwalk with a sign saying gamblers wanted...but he's crossed out gamblers and has written spare change.
capjack2000,a good set of tweets from  about identifying when you have an edge...and when market efficiency has caught up to you.
capjack2000,"ugh...et tu betstars? 

 that is  the market line too...not like you were trying to get the best of them. not cool."
capjack2000,they buried the lead...they are also dealing 0-vig on these two games. +100 on either side. too good to pass up.
capjack2000,this is especially true of derivative bets. limits cut down to $150 arent uncommon. still much better than most euros though.
capjack2000,these guys continue to impress. they got dealt a bad hand by njdge and decided to turn it into positive marketing.
dinkinc,i bet the flyers to win the cup getting 60-1.   other bet was nashville whi i think will turn things around
dinkinc,the nba is partners with draft kings and 30 years ago i got a felony for taking bets.... always a trendsetter
dinkinc,feel bad for the lions. totally beat by two horrible calls and a no call.  review everything or nothing at all
dinkinc,two games in and everyone has figured the nfl out.. bookies must be shaking in their boots as week three approaches
dinkinc,my initial thought was why didnt i book this to be honest.  but i guess josh has first dibs on himself
dinkinc,i dislike thoughts and prayers but there are a lot of good people who use it... that statement is just unfair
dinkinc,he was one of my all time favorite horses ....likely after carry back crimson giant and of course star parade ......
dinkinc,he goes by his own rules... he has no idea about the rules of racing... or how to spell most states....
robpizzola,permanently. bookie is going to shatter my knee caps with a crow bar when i can't pay for this vikings loss.
robpizzola,"""after review the ball hit the ground. it is an incomplete pass. clock operator please set the game clock to 0:00."""
robpizzola,how can you say a team is awful on the road if theyve previously only played two road games this season?
robpizzola,2019 browns looking a lot like the 2018 browns and 2017 browns and basically all the browns for the past decade.
robpizzola,ksu with the classic kick a field goal to turn a three-score game into a three-score game in the 4th quarter.
robpizzola,i cant imagine being a neutral hockey fan and rooting for any scenario where we have to watch more avalanche games.
robpizzola,"god i'm so bad at this.

a $100 parlay on columbus in 4 and islanders in 4 would have paid $90549."
robpizzola,i mean they almost already did win with him. they just ran into arguably one of the best teams of all-time.
RASPicks,public record that i have done all sorts of shady things?  i'd say that applies to you much more than me.
RASPicks,was asked earlier about handicappers we endorse/follow.  let us  turn the question. who do you think is worth paying attention to?
RASPicks,doesn't make much sense.   college football  is a big market if we make a bad play the market will correct itself.
RASPicks,yes historically the plays have still been profitable even at the close but profits would be cut by more than half.
RASPicks,i  daily fantasy sports  know the exact number it doesn't happen often but doesn't take many to significantly impact bottom line.
RASPicks,we haven't offered service since jan 15.  only way to get the picks is right here on twitter  the .co/jhawook2 forum.
RASPicks,check out our new page that details many shady practices in the sports service industry and what makes ras different: .co/nsamxap
RASPicks,2011 college football packages are finally up.  week 1 side plays will be released as early as monday aug 22.  .co/zarxpfs

VegasRefund,this is still one of the funniest sports moments ive ever witnessed to this day. the commentary is what makes it.

VegasRefund,football is football and id much rather have a game to watch tonight than not even if its a meaningless one.
VegasRefund,are these mini-ads on fox a result of them limiting commercial breaks throughout the game? if so im ok with them.
ProfessorShine,gil has a huge bias as he used to be a tout and most of the guests on vsin are touts.
ProfessorShine,brought up good points about vd but matty almost as bad with his defense of jason mcintyre being good at gambling.
ProfessorShine,in  college basketball  its always been if its close its a goaltend.  hope this isnt decided by 2-4 points oregons way
ProfessorShine,the issue is sales touts who are promoted as pros fooling rec bettors into buying shitty pics. free posters i ignore.
suuma810,"huge bomb to fuller followed by a run for minus one yard which kills the drive.

you cant make this up."
suuma810,jop. die defense ist grandios aber der momentane level ist den gegnern/qbs geschuldet. wird sptestens nach der bye week anders aussehen.
suuma810,oh for sure. their season largely depends on the delta in offensive improvement but their schedule could propel them a lot.
suuma810,few days ago i was wondering if theres a team that would trade for joe flacco. of course elway did. #broncos
suuma810,exactly. for the loss of a down (considering the jets convert on 2nd  2) he saved the time and a timeout.
suuma810,it is  not a cheap sound bite and passing is never worse except for short downs and red zone/goal line situations.
suuma810,#dolphins move to 9-1 su in home games under adam gase when either ryan tannehill or brock osweiler starts at qb.
suuma810,"ravens are down 3 points and call back-to-back runs on 1st and 2nd down - 3rd  10 almost picked.

just why?"
suuma810,tweeted out some nfl #betting tips over the past couple months. here you can find all of them in one post!
ClevTA,young was an inch away from a strip or sack at least 7-8 times. he was great but lawrence releases fast
ClevTA,what are u asking? fade him? hes the worst bettor ive ever seen lol. im opp on clemson and lsu so
ClevTA,hou d has allowed 2nd most targets to rbs and are 30th in ypa allowed to rbs out of the backfield
ClevTA,why does he have to say something publicly? his goal is to reduce his suspension not gain sympathy from the public
ClevTA,but when u include your preseason picks you are at least .500. please step aside and learn from the very best
ClevTA,right but just looking up and seeing it was always helpful. i know its 1st world problems but seems so simple
ClevTA,nothing bothers me more about the iphone 11 than the fact the battery  percent  doesnt show anymore. what a fatal flaw
ClevTA,darius slayton can have a goosegg or go for 100+ and multiple  touchdown s today. he's the ultimate dart throw imo
ClevTA,seems simple to me. only other explanation is it was all baker's doing to go fast and he is covering up
ClevTA,followed up by pollack saying we need a picture of your mom. lets see what we are working with excellent work
ClevTA,i love playoff baseball too. i was genuinely shocked when i turned on espn at 7 and they had a preview
ClevTA,i get it and makes sense. but that may be the only time nc has its destiny in its own hands
ClevTA,$8 billion valuation for peloton. who knew an exercise bike could be so valuable.  deserves proceeds for all the free advertising
CizzlingSports,"also this passage really made me laugh

pretty sure the  and  of the world are not out to get you lol"
CizzlingSports,"or (3) using this nonsense to promote special ""blood bank"" plays with $100 limits that clay la8er chest-thumps when they win?"
CizzlingSports,"thumping his chest abt a 5-0 start (against $250 opening lines available at one book)

he started 12-3 in 2017 and:"
CizzlingSports,he most certainly did not get clem 1h -21 -110 but then again he doesn't actually bet so nothing really matters
CizzlingSports,maybe u gaiz want to refer and link to the current version of the law not the one from 1961 gjge
CizzlingSports,lots going on here but the point as usual is to remember that this man  wants to sell you gambooling pickz
CizzlingSports,"hi  do u really think # worst of all time   is the right guy for this content???

 i do not know"
CizzlingSports,"yep

now  it is  ""u should follow us because losing is more fun this way than betting your own coin flips"""
CizzlingSports,and yet you released picks on the last monday of 17-week package02 when none of the guarantees were in play there
CizzlingSports,picks are supposed to release around 11am but  it is  the last day of a severely losing package so who cares
CizzlingSports,not sure other than that these two going after each other is always entertaining like little kids arguing over who's dumber
spanky,damn my stories are so good they sound fake.  you think ill ever have a shot at this whole book thing?
spanky,"youre right.  

i have automated programs that actually place tens of thousands of bets a day.  

good luck to you pal."
spanky,no problem with raising. also no problem with circled. but the other 99.9 percent  of cases should have clearly stated limits
spanky,so if you're even with the closing line then we both agree that closing line is everything and market is efficient.
spanky,i thought i knew most of the pros in the business but i have no idea who david halpern is.  (6/7)
spanky,when your software limits customers to $10 grocery dollars an hour to nfl kickoff your license should be revoked.  absolutely pathetic
spanky,"i'm still waiting on word from  if they removed delays.
i'll be trying   and  soon.  any feedback on those three joints?"
spanky,even if you estimate your edge correctly full kelly is disastrous.  maximizing positive expected value is pointless without simultaneously minimizing risk.
spanky,you think they'll let me come and check it out? i  daily fantasy sports  wanna be escorted out in handcuffs by
spanky,fanduel is paying 82k on their mistake! new business plan: forget gambling! instead seek out errors and run to the bank!
spanky,paul revere was a little late on this one.  here we are with 100+ locations and growing.  thanks for your help.
DocBettor,made a synthetic bet on this lakers / clippers battle of los angeles being a close one #lalvslac #nba #lakeshow #clippernation
DocBettor,its because the positive expected value of 8 is much better than 16 against those dealer up cards (but still negative)
DocBettor,mlb betting juxtaposition of blindly backing certain favorites (start of this  thread) vs. blindly backing certain underdogs (linked  tweet)  cc      #gamblingtwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,cool article h/t   i always suspected that this world existed. now i can teach the 6yo son to become an ap.
PlusEVAnalytics,who the fuck takes their significant other to a strip club on a date? is this typical behaviour in american culture?
PlusEVAnalytics,if youre a ref you need to carry that flag everywhere you go you never know when you will need it
PlusEVAnalytics,thats some stupid mafioso nonsense. do you avoid using coupons because some day the store might want a favor from you?
PlusEVAnalytics,gonna try to bang out an article on this before the week 2 games happen and i look like a jackass
PlusEVAnalytics,and thats why they want to lower the voting age to 8? seems like thats your stock answer to everything lol.
PlusEVAnalytics,if you can hit 58 percent  vs closing lines the supercontest is a very poor use of your time and resources.
PlusEVAnalytics,imagine wall street if insider trading were allowed....you dont have to imagine its real and its called betting on nfl preseason
PlusEVAnalytics,im not an expert on gsw rotations - whose playing time will get cut the most due to boogie being in?
PlusEVAnalytics,yes if youre the only person in the world who knows that they must win tonight. actually even then probably not.
PlusEVAnalytics,of course a purely objective/algorithmic selection would be best...side benefit is that it would force the issue of defining the objective
PlusEVAnalytics,vsin does not help bettors. turning losing bettors into losing bettors who believe theyre winning bettors is a disservice to them.
PlusEVAnalytics,and you know that the wheel was bought second hand from a casino thats known for cheating now were getting warmer.
PlusEVAnalytics,youre testing for toenail fungus per my tweet earlier. youre not finding any. doesnt mean the patient doesnt have lung cancer.
aluckyaday,2.15 percent  surebet in the 12:00 aintree without the fav if anyone wants to get their accounts closed. evs 5/4 28/1
aluckyaday,unless the sheep is addicted to being skinned. then he will find a way to get another skin and go again!
aluckyaday,not convinced by the computers selections this week! cleveland really? and maybe confused by mahones playing or not but lets see.
aluckyaday,only effects people who bet in those 10 minutes but still they should not be able to get away with it.
aluckyaday,if you can't answer that question and more importantly brexiteers can not agree on an answer then brexit can never happen.
aluckyaday,what did the distribution of positive expected value look like? skewed by the ones that were +ev. was the median +ev?
aluckyaday,just look at the roi over the 4 years sure most people would be happy to get anywhere close to that!
aluckyaday,what  daily fantasy sports  you agree with? try asking paris smith or denise coats if you  daily fantasy sports  believe me.
aluckyaday,"how would you define the ""live line""? could be an opportunity here for a sportsbook sponsorship here. using their live lines."
aluckyaday,its a very profitable model just ask paris smith. numbers she can only dream about. probably referring to denise coates salary
aluckyaday,i now use oddsportal which has price change history for each match. although i'm not convinced that is perfectly accurate either.
aluckyaday,i thought he was referring to how the posterior distribution had changed from the prior that was telling him to quit.
theFirmAISports,you guys are amazing!! cant thank you enough for your work! you make everything we do possible! #rstats #datascience #sportsanalytics #sportsbetting
joeytunes2,clemson plus 6 for your lungs. everyone keeps doubting. i have them a pk. already took a bad number at  4.5

joeytunes2,"getting alot of dms..  real fast..

drexel -1/1.5 would take 2 max
wv 3
ind 14.5/14
635 drake 1
fresno -8.5"
joeytunes2,kc line is dripping on nothing cold weather to each of these teams means nothing will be looking to bet over.
joeytunes2,hmmmm pay your debts before you troll. ill let you know if i need cough syrup. let the big boys play.
joeytunes2,can we all go back to betting with the locals. the states are the real criminals! just make locals pay taxes.
joeyisaks,or the guys 20-50 in world arent a joke rotterdam surface is a joke/ an equalizer how slow it is playing
joeyisaks,friend of mine never bet before started selling knows nothing about betting just good at marketing is makin 30k a month
joeyisaks,tired of getting rich from pinterest stock so im buying some $snap stock first ever porn ccompany ive bought stock in
joeyisaks,the air in melbourne according to weather app is hazardous this doesnt seem like this is gonna be an isolated incident
joeyisaks,read it wrong my bad! well i also had falcons moneyline .. glad i wasnt watching i read about the ending
joeyisaks,whose lines do you use? its an illiquid market ... so its tough to use but you have to factor it
joeyisaks,an investigation into what? the game wasnt effected? do you really need the 20$ back that you lost back that bad?
EdMillerPoker,not gonna be irrelevant to all the people lighting money on fire backing dubious ventures reliant on this faulty analogy imo
EdMillerPoker,wait trump is the emperor of china? did that large orb thing have to do with it? gets stranger every day
EdMillerPoker,my experience is they answer only to the court. you likely have a right to ask for a hearing about it.
EdMillerPoker,the faster the industry moves to this model of booking in-play for football the faster they will see betting volumes skyrocket.
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  believe poker is dying but mostly found something new to do and haven't played poker in a while
EdMillerPoker,thanks a lot y'all for making the logic of sports betting an amazon best seller on the first day of presales.
EdMillerPoker,thx man for sure it isn't just for newbies... might be a little advanced for a straight newbie in fact imo
EdMillerPoker,*meme showing worthless venezuelan currency littering an empty street implying same fate is just around the corner for the us dollar*
EdMillerPoker,in general it makes sense to me in the tourist areas in particular to have multiple versions of games. price discrimination.
EdMillerPoker,dont know if they would bother but theyre uniquely situated to both obliterate competition and add substantial value to the industry
EdMillerPoker,im 39 and do but only because i spent a lot of time on a university campus in the mid 80s
EdMillerPoker,"shitty clickbait headline writers could be banned

(seriously you're bad ppl pls find some other way to light society on fire)"
GolcondaFund,"anyone else think byu is a dark horse to go on final 4 run? 

hopefully a 5/6 seed in baylor region."
GolcondaFund,"this is a coach who is disconnected.
read the room.
know your players.
you are a bullshit rah rah cheerleader.
#lead"
GolcondaFund,"this is unprecedentedly bad.
any player over 60 on madden rating is going to quit on this team. so maybe 5?"
GolcondaFund,"only because  college football  is a sh*t show and #squaresharp podcasts make conclusions like - 
best bet fsu cuz athletes! lol"
GolcondaFund,looking at fau on the upset/points over navy. home dog. can d slow down navy triple option key to game. #footballfriday
nonrandomalpha,great question! each week is considered a rebalance of the sportfolio so the allocations are as of the current net assets.
nonrandomalpha,gotta roll with the ups and downs. its an unspoken truth that we all kinda live for this turbulent ride. weeeeee
nonrandomalpha,setting good industry precedents by promoting honesty integrity and transparency. cheers to your shop - keep up the good work fellas.
nonrandomalpha,georgia - been super close to being a dynasty of their own the last two years. it comes together this year.
LeeSharpeNFL,incase you missed it  i did a thread on an image telling the story of each divisional race through week 16!
LeeSharpeNFL,"there was a time earlier in the season where it looked like carolina might be at least ok.

they were not."
LeeSharpeNFL,i would pay money for it. i realize that is an economic privilege i have that doesn't apply to everyone though.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""what team won by a lot with little offensive performance?"" is a good way to describe a lot of bears wins."
LeeSharpeNFL,thst is true. though this is an objective question at least. i  daily fantasy sports  like reviewing subjective stuff at all.
LeeSharpeNFL,you didn't era adjust those numbers though. those stats are a lot more reasonable 15-20 years ago than they are today.
LeeSharpeNFL,"if these immature ""lmaooooo"" tweets wht you guys want to do feel free but take it out of my mentions. thanks."
LeeSharpeNFL,"not ""benched"" exactly. they were down by four scores gruden didn't want to risk him being injured for a hopeless game."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""i'm not owned! i'm not owned!"" shouts ryan pace every time trubisky throws a go ahead touchdown against a bad team."
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah hence the ""may"". the point being  that is  a very low number of 1pm et games for a non-west-coast team."
LeeSharpeNFL,believe it or not nagy has only lost one game by more than one score (this year week 7 vs. no)
LeeSharpeNFL,dak has enormous leverage he can just refuse to sign the tender and it will be very bad for the cowboys.
whale_capper,imagine if there were an nfl handicapping show that you could watch and comment on live... great news there is one:
whale_capper,new deep dive with reactions to week 10 and an early look at week 11 is up for your listening pleasure...
whale_capper,new deep dive is live... we put a bow on week 4 and lookahead at the openers for week 5 enjoy!
whale_capper,they also have a game in london but they are not starting early to allow for 16 straight  hours of action
whale_capper,good observation... just when you think someone is a football genius they go and draft sony michel in the first round
whale_capper,what does it look like if we change the y-axis to deviation from the team total implied by the closing spread/total?
whale_capper,i was being a little sarcastic but it may come across more sympathetic and less burn all touts than youd like
whale_capper,february just gone... lakers lost a playoff run with ad and lbj and the pels got less than was offered then
whale_capper,in the last few years nadal steadily improves from point 1 to point ### wasnt paying much attention in 2011-2013 timeframe
whale_capper,what a blast... two rounds of the group stage and all the knockouts left so the best is yet to come!
whale_capper,like the full game under better fh looks about right... will probably grab some 2h under or a derivative at ht
whale_capper,yeah that was the problem i ran into... you end up with a super tiny sample as you get more specific
whale_capper,id like to see fvv put up a nice +/- number today too against the soft second unit for the sixers
whale_capper,absolutely have to... if nadal comes up against fog in the draw the underlay on rafa is going to be insane
AndyMSFW,didn't have any plays for  college basketball  today but there's a fat slate for tomorrow i'll certainly have a few plays.
AndyMSFW,just one sunday play which is good since there's nfl on and i'm going on a teaser bonanza in the morning.
AndyMSFW,seems like forever ago i was fully bought in to a #3 fsu team going in and beating bama.  rip deondre...
AndyMSFW,yeah the worst case game state is probably oakland getting out to a lead early and using an efficient run attack.
AndyMSFW,i'm just hoping a group of adults tasked with counting by whole numbers can manage to do their jobs this year.
AndyMSFW,"your margins are stellar 
they're really great rates.
but i can't bloody use them 
because i live in the states.
#nationalwritingday"
AndyMSFW,begs the question: what is the criteria for the world rankings of accounting firms and who is putting together said rankings?
AndyMSFW,i think i've seen all i need to see this season.  this october: nola-berrios game 1 should be a doozy. #mlb
AndyMSFW,plus who chooses a soft four as what the dice land on? years old or a hard-way is the pro move.
JoeyKnish22,bowden landed a punch but it was more than an hour before the game so he cant be ejected lol. goat
JoeyKnish22,its 4th and 1 to almost put them away. and if you miss and they score you have more time anyway.
JoeyKnish22,dont have a strong opinion or a wager on that one personally but obviously a lot of respected money hammering usc.
JoeyKnish22,(i know theyre supposed to be moneyline underdogs its a cheap bit and im actually trying to give out a winner)
JoeyKnish22,actually got a bowl lock for tonight id be willing to sell you at half price ($500) dm for more info.
JoeyKnish22,physically. yes my bookie kicking me continuously while im on the ground cause i dont have settle up money. it hurts.
JoeyKnish22,sir. is there a problem with the app? not seeing it?? should i send my player number via dms for comps?
JoeyKnish22,dont try and company man me to give you free clicks. ill just assume it was a hard fought close game.
JoeyKnish22,neither of us have any money left if the bears dont cover -2.5 so really doesnt matter either way rexy boy.
JoeyKnish22,i said scam in the first post im trying to show an educated man from detroit has a broad vocabulary tyvm
JoeyKnish22,it is nice taco bell stays open on holidays for that late meal post thanksgiving option. have a good shift buddy.
JoeyKnish22,i can see listening to the deep dive at 2x cause those two could do 3 hours on just titans/bucs itself.
JoeyKnish22,oh baby i grabbed a ton when peters was announced a go. number was crazy with him starting. your illi  train!
JoeyKnish22,"some people talk a big game about betting into circa openers. 

other people actually bet into them and move the numbers."
JoeyKnish22,just remembered  got rid of nfl redzone now i want to set my cable box on fire and choke a bitch.
TheKostos,the plane had been in the air all day and needed a rest. the cowboys will now fly tavon austin home
TheKostos,"lol u think trubisky is as good as farve??? and u get paid to talk about sports lmfao 

(how'd i do?)"
TheKostos,i played the ravens defense in a high-stakes playoff matchup so thats why theyre getting gouged in case you were wondering
TheKostos,gotta keep it . i kinda like kyrie irving. he keeps it real whether you agree with him or not. respect
TheKostos,ive won way too many bets this week to feel comfortable. disaster is looming. gamblor i humbly ask thee for mercy
TheKostos,#nbanick likely wont have time to cap today got a bunch going on. if that changes ill tweet out any picks.
TheKostos,i do too. its fun. aew is so much damn fun. and they dont torture their audience. what a novel concept!
TheKostos,and yes i have probably seen every charlie sheen episode (the ashton kutcher episodes never happened as far as i'm concerned)
TheKostos,the punishment from last night's  is one of the best ever. no hyperbole. i was laughing out loud the whole time.
TheKostos,took a bath on the night game but cleaned up on the early game. back at it tomorrow.  live 10a-12p et
LockyLockerson,there are ohio state fans in the condo next to us and they havent stopped yelling at fields and olave yet
LockyLockerson,anything else? go to brad and gary? go to the halftime studio thats already set up for updates of other games?
LockyLockerson,i guess just seems like you should hold the lakers off the board almost every night between davis injuries and rest
LockyLockerson,daily fantasy sports  think i've bet a single favorite yet on saturday.  this should be great.  what could possibly go wrong.
LockyLockerson,also i tweeted a lot yesterday and most of it was rambling but this is something ill be doing every week
LockyLockerson,doesnt this depend a lot on the offshore or vegas sportsbook youre using? or was it the same one each year?
LockyLockerson,i'm so mad they aren't giving the coaches actual flags.  d'antoni just shoving it down scott foster's throat would've been great.
LockyLockerson,"wut?!?

guessing the athletic but whatever it is your stuff is awesome and i hope you keep doing all of it."
LockyLockerson,with it pouring track sealed i'm gonna go improbable but sprinkle in some war of will spinoff and by my standards
LockyLockerson,yep that was just the nba card for me dm me if you want i can walk you thru stuff today
LockyLockerson,pod of tonight's show now up.  again really appreciate  and all our guests who took the time tonight.  worth checking out!
LockyLockerson,since i'm still looking for a winner tonight i've decided i am the winner of the #iowacaucuses.  now i feel better.

Gingfacekillah,i definitely would.  it is  very flexible and a great online learning platform. imo the ideal way to learn data science.

Gingfacekillah,yep put it together over the last day and a half. not that hard lots of material out there to assist.

kellyinvegas,was ready to kill me last time we were in nyc. all i did was quote that movie biggie and 50.

ToddFuhrman,somewhere up there big dog is repulsed that we can't blindly bet unders in the 1h of these marquee sec games
ToddFuhrman,if the buckeyes draw the badgers from the west  in the league title game a moneyline rollover would create better roi
ToddFuhrman,was on the dog small from early in the week but if you happened to move on under good cash there

ToddFuhrman,ryne...after the debacle saturday vs unlv all of your focus should be on the first team to 10 saturday in evanston!
ToddFuhrman,"after watching countless hours of football this weekend i have one major takeaway:

there's not a single product that  won't endorse"
ToddFuhrman,you never take the ball...you play defense so you know what you need to do in order to win the game
ToddFuhrman,you mail in every day of work on  so  it is  kinda like you're retired already right? wait nvm... that is
ToddFuhrman,yep; you'll be stuck with us again however official return date of  still hasn't been announced but safe to say mid-august

TheCousinSal,i have lots and lots and lots of money on the astros and i still think that is a bad call.
TheCousinSal,this is going to do wonders for my popularity in pennsylvania or new jersey.  i may have to run for governor.
TheCousinSal,its just nice to be a mets fan in mid-august and not have to listen to everyone talk about tim tebow.
TheCousinSal,good point  my legs are the most honest part of my body. probably because i refuse to scrub them while showering.
TheCousinSal,you can make all the fun you want but this really isnt that bad for thailand womens first soccer game ever.
TheCousinSal,coach nurse and drake are going to be nude spooning by the scorers table if the bucks dont start playing defense.

12Xpert,"i expect this will be popular amongst nerds. 
not so much amongst tv football pundits.

12Xpert,the fact this question is even been asked hypothetically implies  it is  already over for arsenal. welcome to the wilderness. #wengerin
12Xpert,precisely. if the variance on a -1 percent  best guess is +/- 10 percent  how useful is the best guess prediction?
12Xpert,but the enhanced is not really enhanced just the market without the additional offers is de-hanced (if  that is  a word).
12Xpert,"weekend extra leagues data added: 
remaining midweek fixtures also now available (china and usa). apologies for missing this morning's chinese games."

RufusPeabody,its almost like this was foreseeable  and people who were pointing this out actually knew what they were talking about...
RufusPeabody,agree. we need (a) a way to educate people and (b) a way to unite to make our voice heard
RufusPeabody,awesome! and thanks for the re-education. i wasn't old enough to understand all the wheelings and dealings in the mid-90s.
RufusPeabody,thanks bob. how much of an outlier is that (i was thinking something like a coach or qb-level mixed effect)
RufusPeabody,i started going to therapy a few years back and wish i had started sooner. mental health is so important.
RufusPeabody,honestly it makes no sense chris. when i try to model what the committee is grading on its completely inconsistent.
RufusPeabody,this is why i loved the sat. its not a test of knowledge but of problem solving. so many shortcuts.
RufusPeabody,chance the assumptions and re-do the math. assuming 100 percent  pat percent  the break-even 2-pt rate is ~38 percent .
RufusPeabody,have you seen those pictures of vegas dave with those huge stacks of money? thats how you know someone legit.
RufusPeabody,might want to re-examine your estimated probabilities adam. with the stickiness of numbers a simple smoothing approach is not ideal.
RufusPeabody,too much noise to model player-specific. need info on swing changes injuries equipment changes etc to do anything meaningful imo
RufusPeabody,"corollary: a sharp bettor isnt sharp on every bet.

(i just wish i could know which ones were square beforehand)"
RufusPeabody,not quite. woodie was 1-for-4 with solo 54-hole lead and 1-for-8 with a share prior to his us open win.
RufusPeabody,posting winning tickets is an invitation for someone else to use the picture and try to sell picks with it
RufusPeabody,haha no i just racked up a big position on him. and it also means the tourney hasnt been good
RufusPeabody,at this point whether this is a winning open or not for me hinges almost entirely on whether woodland wins.
RufusPeabody,not good! only got 9 in. started +10 through 5 holes before getting it together. ended up with a 47.
RufusPeabody,oh god  daily fantasy sports  remind me about adam scott. that was one of the toughest to swallow for me.
RufusPeabody,i assumed  would come up with a way to spin a losing record but wow. talk about moving the goalposts.
RufusPeabody,can we see survey results please. how many people responded to the survey? that should be easy to find out.
jeffma,as soon as we break into the black for doing our podcast you will be the first check we send
jeffma,just seemed weird to keep him in. as far as i know they wont be playing tomorrow win or lose
jeffma,if you are an immigrant you will love this book... if you aren't you will love this book... get it!
jeffma,want last minute help with your brackets? the legend  talks sleepers final four and a surprise national champion on  with
jeffma,because it was all big ben turnovers. steelers actually outgained them. that being said history seems to be repeating itself
jeffma,and he did similarly stupid stuff this post season. his lack of confidence in edwards became a self fulfilling prophecy
jeffma,yeah.  that is  why i was asking top down or bottoms up but never got an answer. assuming top down
jeffma,sadly i wasn't nervous. just blanked on my third game and my ifb wasn't working. appreciate the support though :)
jeffma,follow me please so i can dm you... else you will no longer be allowed to beat me in settlers
jeffma,i just  daily fantasy sports  think it was a bad spot. certainly not by two yards as they were saying
jeffma,agreed. the decisions are bad but more troublesome is the explanation of the decisions both before and after the fact.
SportsCheetah,tom out here hustling like we didnt watch him scramble for 17 yards on 4th and 6 the other night.
SportsCheetah,they have the two worst net ratings on the season among raptors that play regular minutes. that was before tonight.
SportsCheetah,we'll be doing an article on chalk covering each bowl game. and i like clemson over at 63 or better.
SportsCheetah,they said that was his career-high at 27 could be wrong i didn't check but the announcers were discussing it.
SportsCheetah,good to see im using up my run good this week on parking spaces at the life time in summerlin.
SportsCheetah,you can win by 1 or 2 points for all i care. i was just relaying the football outsiders metric.
SportsCheetah,the 2010 raiders went 6-0 in the afc west and didn't win the division nor did they make the playoffs.
SportsCheetah,one of the hold early on  touchdown  run or failing end of 1h from 6 inches out prob the swing
SportsCheetah,50 percent  of male students at byu return from their missions with that hair and 90 percent  graduate with it.

capjack2000,eh...check your numbers there.  that is  what operators have brought in. the taxation on that is quite a bit less.

ProfessorShine,amazing peter burns! they just seem to know exactly how these games will fall!  which is so great for them!
ProfessorShine,that actually might be good for irvine. they will give any of the proposed 5 seeds a ton of problems.
ProfessorShine,easiest part of ones game to work on is free throw shooting.  yale putting on a very simple clinic 16-16
ProfessorShine,jax state  murray are both better than nwest  illinois.  only those who pretend to follow the mid\ lower-tier teams\leagues disagree.
suuma810,to be fair they also have the best non-divisional record of all teams over the past ten years or something.
suuma810,mike maccagnan and the art of persuasion. probably took a lot to get gregg to decline all those hc offers.
suuma810,no touchdown because you run it up the middle for -1 yard on first down. it didnt work all game
suuma810,the raiders ran the same fake punt on them last week and la didnt even prepare for it this time.
suuma810,"who would have thought the afc playoffs have a good chance to be great?

kc lac ne pit hou  ind?"
suuma810,i think -6.5/-7 is a fair line for the game with tannehill out. -4 with tannehill felt a bit high.
suuma810,"agree. titans defense should give buf fits.
i just dont like the spot for them laying 5 on the road."
ClevTA,uk should run philly special. would work for a  touchdown  here. but im on vt so run it instead plz
ClevTA,as much as they try still cant knock kawhi off the pedestal. clips still the best team in the west
ClevTA,nope. historically betting on teams with win to get in is actually one of the worst bets u can make
ClevTA,haven't read this anywhere yet but a decent amount of wildcat from the steelers wouldn't surprise me at all today
ClevTA,u have buff beating pit in pit as a lock? pit will be a 3/3.5 point favorite in that game
ClevTA,right guard was not even close to an issue last night. the left side it was all on that side

CizzlingSports,what's the backup pr/marketing strategy when u realize these bets are touted by ppl who are actually long term loosers
CizzlingSports,but then how's he gonna sell new 17-week packages that start in 6 days when the current package is loosing?
CizzlingSports,aaaaaaand this is precisely why  wants his tv picks podcast pickz periscope pickz etc. counted in his  college football  records.
CizzlingSports,"if he just picks the others why does he still call them ""bets"" and ""wagers?"" should we just ignore those?"
CizzlingSports,sort of seems like posting an actual number matters for this  college football  total but maybe not mr. -298 units
CizzlingSports,very special series of #tbt this weak fam.  it is  the 1 year anniversary of the  special!!! (1/3 cont'd wed.-thurs.):
CizzlingSports,.lmao oh wow look at my record against the best available line at any time from any book on earth
CizzlingSports,"ranking anything other than rust above puppets is a big 

but i will revisit persistence now because of this #taek"
CizzlingSports,to me anthrax were always the clown-princes of thrash. but their last two albums completely changed the game for me.
CizzlingSports,"the jambos tweets say:

""overall vs best available: 4490 plays +108.65 u""

 that is  the same record you just quoted"
CizzlingSports,it is  because they are giving themselves free +units on plays that resolved before they started selling picks on 8/27/19
spanky,"picking winners is 1 percent  of the battle!

the other 99 percent  is finding places who will book those winners!"
spanky,"my trading room vs pointsbet trading room.  

im unfortunately no longer an active customer.

i wonder who came out ahead"
spanky,depends on so many factors. you have to have a feel. sit and watch. there is no cookie cutter recipe
spanky,they all know i get the best numbers. i have too many outs and my technology is second to none.
spanky,"lugers has definitely fallen off over the years.  

most solid consistent steak ive had the last 5 years is mastros."
spanky,kicking out customers who never even set foot in the joint for undesirable behavior aint a good look either for
spanky,offshores treat customers better than this.  side note -  its counterintuitive to hang on under on top of an over...
spanky,keep us posted on your refund status   if you have any outs i'd be happy to play them for us
spanky,which is fine but how can one hold any weight on information from someone who doesnt bet their own money?
spanky,tunes has been known to throw people across the room just for fun. dont let the pretty face fool ya
spanky,are not bookmakers.  they are dressmakers.  that being said despite them losing in nj i think they made money nationwide...
spanky,thank you  for using your connects to have ncaa update the score of the syracuse/ st bony game to 81-48.
spanky,i like combing the two pieces into one option....  its wrong imo to isolate the -102 as a separate option....
spanky,exchanges sound good theoretically but in practice its hard for them to ever be liquid enough. i hope im wrong.
DocBettor,actually im wrong  because a team with 156 could score a 3 which would make the maximum possible total 315
DocBettor,thanks i tried to get more in-game at +500 but the bet got rejected so it feels like a loss
DocBettor,"danny green over 8.5 points -145
danny green over 9.5 points -114
danny green over 2.5 made 3 pointers +125"
PlusEVAnalytics,what youre missing mr lucky is that even recreational bettors have an expectation (or at least a hope) of winning.
PlusEVAnalytics,i mean im old enough to remember when this team was the st louis rams and im not that old.
PlusEVAnalytics,something bad happened to me and im a member of x disadvantaged group gotta be the end boss of correlation/causation?
PlusEVAnalytics,tough question depends on your priors. i gave an answer earlier this week not much change between then and now.
PlusEVAnalytics,and your investors may not calculate it that way but your customers obviously do. think about which is more important.
PlusEVAnalytics,"ep 112 where the players dwell! (cc 

this was a fun one thanks  went fairly deep into taleb-style mathematical philosophy."
PlusEVAnalytics,election day on facebook is like halloween but everyone dresses up as the same thing - a virtue signaling d-bag.
PlusEVAnalytics,probably not in football. something like tennis where points won/lost is a strong proxy for matches won/lost is a possibility.
PlusEVAnalytics,couldnt the government just make bitcoin purchases with fiat subject to sales tax and voila thats the end of bitcoin?
PlusEVAnalytics,better than 50 percent  against the stale contest line exactly 50 percent  against the live line is my working assumption.
PlusEVAnalytics,you americans should watch cfl youd love it. theres an ad on the sidelines for milk. like literally just milk.
PlusEVAnalytics,if you dont like the article why have you been bothering me all day about it? go get a job.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes but not in the same way as you do. im insulted that you havent listened to my  appearance :(
PlusEVAnalytics,might be a little high-brow for this audience. i had to google the diverged in a yellow wood reference lol
PlusEVAnalytics,brandon - this guy is a con artist working for another con artist and the picks youre buying are worthless.
PlusEVAnalytics,that is an all star english accent. reminds me of these commercials (excuse me adverts) that play on local radio
PlusEVAnalytics,thanks - thats great and its what im using for match-level data. i dont think it has point by point?
PlusEVAnalytics,surveying would you ever pay for x is like surveying would you ever cheat on your spouse. talk is cheap.
PlusEVAnalytics,already did but im kelly betting 2k bankroll so my bets are probably too small to move lines (for now)
PlusEVAnalytics,i like the feeling of alcohol hand sanitizer as it evaporates off my hands. reminds me of vegas in july.
PlusEVAnalytics,the controversy is the guy and his wife shared their selections with each other and used that to their advantage.
aluckyaday,a weirdly named bias. most biases are named after what causes them whereas that one is named after the consequence.
aluckyaday,human nature assumes the profitable event is due to skill and the loss making event due to lack of it.
aluckyaday,this weeks moneyline selections. teased saints to +3 myself but for the record i'll stick to what the computer says.
aluckyaday,i guess gambling must be classed as a finance activity so they  daily fantasy sports  have to do annual returns?
aluckyaday,oh i forgot it would also depend on your ability to detect inefficiencies too. i guess that is a given
aluckyaday,in reality an insider is anyone who has information that is not in the market be it public or private.
aluckyaday,was hoping dqs would try something. will they be getting worried about bennett getting enough bonuses to challenge for gc?
aluckyaday,anybody know of any publically available season sims out there now  has put his excellent ones behind a paywall ?
aluckyaday,have you ever though that because no one else is disagreeing with him it may be you that is wrong?
aluckyaday,cheers my mums sister arrives today hence the restaurant question. maybe i can get them to come to nunos instead.
theFirmAISports,he brought the seahawks legion of boom defensive philosophy to sf. the they cant call it on every play mentality
theFirmAISports,it is  also important to pay attention to the time of year. certain topics and words change with the seasons...
theFirmAISports,its a shame the pac-12 has been so down.. we would have loved to beat some ranked teams this year
theFirmAISports,"calgary flames vs. colorado avalanche

joeytunes2,lac had 7 turnovers yesterday. lol  what the fuck ! thats like 75 percent  of possessions ended in a turnover.
joeytunes2,"life is grand.
gerrit cole has an opt-out after the fifth year of his deal with yankees - jeff passan"
joeytunes2,hmmm should i go back to the rose bowl. it was probably the best event i've been to in sports.
joeytunes2,lets get these markets going. leave the bookmaker out of it. just  like poker. you can't get cut from poker.
joeytunes2,man that was rough. one kid almost didnt get his dad to buy him a car when he turned 17.
joeytunes2,anyone else excited for ohio st rutgers.  will there be full limits? or treat it like a harlem globetrotters game?
joeytunes2,beating numbers is a good sign. small sample size. just doesnt look like last year at all. or years past.
joeytunes2,whew! biden vs sanders is gonna be a barn burner. was hoping for biden to draw the 2 in east.
joeytunes2,good job moms in raising all us on the sports twitter community. you did a great job and it shows.
joeytunes2,"under texas (l)

joeytunes2,wouldnt be suprised if the ncaa canceled the tourney today. only a matter of time before a student gets it.
joeyisaks,most locals are broke. won 59$ on a site last week and they said they needed a week to pay
joeyisaks,theres just so many pph agents/bookies now and most are under 25 and have about 1000 dollars to their name
joeyisaks,for $15 we wil text you every 15 minutes because your friend hasnt sent his venmo monday morning at 6:34am
joeyisaks,you have copy pasted this to me now like 5 times i get it if you lose i get 10k
joeyisaks,imagine basing an entire sirius radio station around the notion people would basically wana hear what they have to say
joeyisaks,welcome to la aj pollock! hopefully you can time your dl trips as to not coincide with the post season
joeyisaks,gonna delete this again when it goes down like 3 days ago when u tweeted this at 4200 a btc
joeyisaks,will betonline keep allowing me to beat their openers or so they eventually give the boot? just started playin there
EdMillerPoker,no and i think many of them  daily fantasy sports  properly take into account that the game is college basketball
EdMillerPoker,you are correct debilitating degenerative back injury and erectile dysfunction are a much better deal than a firm comfortable mattress!
EdMillerPoker,its a profoundly silly argument. its highly possible to both offer many markets and not screw up left and right.
EdMillerPoker,really is a sick joke that basically just as we finally become grown-ass people our bodies start turning to jello
EdMillerPoker,there are a few specific reasons for this but i think it will no longer be true within 2 years
EdMillerPoker,tip #1. try ordering your morning latte one size smaller. saving those 50 cents a day will really add up.
EdMillerPoker,if the ho touchdown og touts come out on the under the process stops working for the next 6 weeks
EdMillerPoker,"my wife: why do you post so much weird stuff on twitter that only three people will understand?

me: sometimes"
EdMillerPoker,that is  the answer i clicked and i think  it is  gonna take a while to get matt actually twittering
EdMillerPoker,"we  daily fantasy sports  really ""cover"" any sports... the book is more about how markets work and other logical concepts"
EdMillerPoker,"you could go back to commercial breaks

ding ding we have a winner. this is whats going to happen imo."
EdMillerPoker,well theyre promoting her bc she cant run. guess they figure by the time she can theyll take her down
EdMillerPoker,the entire premise of the project has been a real head scratcher for me since it first hit my radar
EdMillerPoker,"and the ""not running it that way"" part is what could give them an end run around the regulatory infrastructure"

LeeSharpeNFL,oh sorry i meant the overall model. (if you  daily fantasy sports  want to get into it i totally understand.)

LeeSharpeNFL,so i complain about teams not going for it a lot for some balance..... i would have punted here too.
LeeSharpeNFL,kidding  it is  pretty easy for a social media manager to type in pm instead of am. whatever. it happens.
LeeSharpeNFL,good for the jags running a fake punt. down 4 scores you have to try high variance stuff and hope.
LeeSharpeNFL,this is only mean acceleration at the time of the handoff (across plays) not at each moment within a play.
LeeSharpeNFL,"(this was a joke about how ohio state are the ""buckeyes"" and saying ""bucks"" sounds like the milwaukee nba team.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,lafleur may be better tan mccarthy but if the packers were looking for a game management savior he isn't it.
LeeSharpeNFL,i think number of fumbles/ints is going to be more predictive. the tricky part on the fumbles is the recovery.
LeeSharpeNFL,"ahh you switched which is blue between the graphs!

but also why is that happening? o_o  that is  really strange."
LeeSharpeNFL,i did a pull just ten minutes ago looks like  it is  still there. (game_id = 2019110700 play_id = 188)

whale_capper,seemingly impossible... lafluer constantly running when he shouldnt and then not running in any goal to go situation was bizarre
whale_capper,no pre-game action on this one tune in at ht though for a 'scope breakdown of the 2h betting market:
whale_capper,how much weight do you give ol and scheme vs what we have a good signal on his inefficient passing?
whale_capper,colts afc south hasn't moved a cent at pinny on the luck news... already factored in or a big nothingburger?
whale_capper,it was at around 34:00 and it was stats analysis (matchups coaching etc) info (injuries etc) situations and public narratives
whale_capper,all of this in the shadow of moving the team from oakland to sf too... none of this sits well
whale_capper,yeah for real whooe episode dedicated to offseason nba gossip and the lakers will surely take up the lions share
whale_capper,2016 finals was a pretty useful example of how a series market changes as you go through a competitive finals...

TheKostos,wins at arsenal and spurs are great but chelsea really needs to start taking care of business at the bridge
TheKostos,given i am a professional host and not a professional capper i am more than fine with this (accurate) assessment.
TheKostos,i kinda like the challenge of one of the juggernauts with a young team  let us  see how they respond
TheKostos,few things in football are more awesome than belichick holding court with the defense after they got their asses kicked
TheKostos,getting tweets about the halftime show and that my tweet was spot on lol. in the car. what i miss?

Gingfacekillah,with the whole world on the bucks this series is just dying for an upset if only on the spread.
Gingfacekillah,true. most people won't even appreciate this advice until they lose big in a highly efficient market to begin with.
Gingfacekillah,yeah it should be a sliding scale based on the amount of    or    attached to the post.   = max fade.

kellyinvegas,i played them in my bowl contests. and even after  gave them out on boi i couldnt pull the trigger
kellyinvegas,and the  continues to look terrible in bowl games...  let us  hope texas steps up big for the conference tonight....
kellyinvegas,i think it shows top to bottom big12 has better teams than the sec. there are 4 good sec teams.
kellyinvegas,its paid off a few times. thanksgiving vs the bills the vikings eagles and jets just to name a few
kellyinvegas,re do x3 (apple podcast hates me!) the first 10 minutes was originally missing...   talks about eating squirrels at wvu
kellyinvegas,also i get those messages every day. so i have no idea whats real and whats not at this point.
kellyinvegas,thats funny. minty is great. i knew that another woman in the space would only benefit everyone more. including myself
kellyinvegas,if one was under and the other was over. i made the game 28-17  for what  it is  worth .
ToddFuhrman,thats one hell of a political campaign idea as well; going to use it if i ever run for office
ToddFuhrman,so important to know where your money goes or its easy to misremember things to paint a more positive picture
ToddFuhrman,so a move from pk to 6 isn't a big move? i'd say someone out there calling o'brien's bluff here
ToddFuhrman,well played; still wonder if they moved the stadium down there more fans would come out to support the team
ToddFuhrman,"to all those 1h under bettors thats good clean living

to all those 1h over bettors thats a bad beat"
ToddFuhrman,youre going to be the #1 pick in the nfl draft; how the hell do you even consider a return?
ToddFuhrman,haha  it is  a credit to him;  it is  like being a soccer star commanding respect with just 1 name
ToddFuhrman,a chain of kicking camps throughout the state alabama would be a tremendous money maker; great use of  booster dollars
ToddFuhrman,that is  just vontaze being vontaze...still want to know why he had zero air time during hard knicks (random aside)
ToddFuhrman,be careful trashing the sharps...going to need as much anti-pats money as you can find every week this fall compadre
ToddFuhrman,i can tell when payne gets board since he goes the snack route...however i understand his mid podcast cravings for
ToddFuhrman,that is  a buddy you ask if he ever needs an out you're more than happy to book his action

TheCousinSal,from here on out james hardens sensitive eyes will only be able to adjust to last sundays game of thrones.
TheCousinSal,were 4 dolly parton songs in and  has yet to make a golden globes joke. how is this possible? #grammyawards
TheCousinSal,doug baldwin has been phenomenal tonight. i almost forgive him for single-handedly destroying two of my fantasy teams this year.
TheCousinSal,how the eff is this the same defense that shut out the colts last week? football is dumb sometimes. #jaxvsten
TheCousinSal,cant blame the ref there. the block in the back was only right in front of his disgusting face. #pittlayingthepoints
TheCousinSal,madson again! youd think after 6 months and 180 games these managers would know who the bad pitchers are.  #worldseries2018
TheCousinSal,its just easier to back better teams to merely win. also i typically dont like having money on shitty quarterbacks.
TheCousinSal,anyone else just wake up to find out they lost a days salary on the russian hockey team? #karma #pyeonchang2018

TheCousinSal,this is exactly how america felt when spencer + heidi pratt first split. but who gets custody of charles oakley?
TheCousinSal,i sat down with  to talk about our family's gambling history. he actually turned out to be an okay guy.
TheCousinSal,the greek freak actually played defense on that one possession.  he's gonna get a stern talking to at half.  #nbaallstar2017
TheCousinSal,wrong!  if clemson touches the ball after 9 yards bama takes over with 1 sec. left and then who knows?
TheCousinSal,might be time to rename the hail mary needs when  it is  completed 72 percent  of the time. thoughts? #nygvsgb
TheCousinSal,week 14 nfl picks + a $1000 prop challenge + pretty ladies who wouldn't look at me in high school
TheCousinSal,the t-mobile arena crowd is loving this one. they'd tweet about it but the signal here is very weak. #kovalevward
TheCousinSal,the amount of times the word surreal has been used in texts and tweets today is nothing short of surreal.
TheCousinSal,parasite was good but i felt like 1917 should've won best picture since  that is  precisely when this telecast began.
TheCousinSal,"do i have it in me to complete an 0-11 playoff run?  i believe i do!!!

12Xpert,if they hadn't lost to man united on 7th april 2018 they'd have done 24 in a row at 100+

12Xpert,it definitely is there now so trying clearing cache. failing that you'll find it in the latest results file via
12Xpert,no i  daily fantasy sports  other than whether they beat the closing line. if you know another one i'm listening.
12Xpert,its not something i would do but i respect peoples right to do it. i wouldnt take it to heart.
12Xpert,probabilistic thinking with skin in the game encourages better decision making. teach it in schools. #brexit #trump #climatechange #gambling #uncertainty
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  normally follow such thing but i suspect this one is going to be a lot of fun.
12Xpert,entertaining? in theory  it is  the crowds who pay their salaries. if they stop watching the sponsors stop funding them.
12Xpert,more complicated biases presumably imply smaller samples which will impact on statistical significance. show me the money i mean data
12Xpert,yes  that is  precisely it. and not suggest that you can win by being savvy sharp or smart on telly.

mschwimer,several people have asked about the validity of our record. the note below explains everything. as always providing full transparency!
mschwimer,its crazy. i couldnt wrap my head around it either. not until i saw the numbers. our record doesnt lie.

RufusPeabody,seemed like chase young had a huge impact though. lawrence had to rush and unable to get through reads.

2) nyg
3) atl
4) cin
5) nyg"
RufusPeabody,is that really worth a challenge? as a viewer a challenge on this is certainly not worth my time.
RufusPeabody,he says he has documented records. you say your picks are verified by a top-10 nationally recognized accounting firm.
RufusPeabody,why would i bet a known scam artist? doesnt seem smart. hes trying to use me build his profile.
RufusPeabody,haha yep he's got 17 top 5s since 2000 without a win but isn't an active pga tour golfer.
RufusPeabody,"wasn't my intention to ""come at"" schwim. i know him personally. just trying to push him to go further."
RufusPeabody,thanks for having me pinnacle (and  you know how i feel about sportsbooks that take on all comers ;)
RufusPeabody,if you really want ill post a picture but im going to delete the post a few minutes later
RufusPeabody,will be launching a consumer protection for bettors nonprofit in the not-too-distant future if all goes according to plan.
RufusPeabody,i got to hang out in the speakers room but i think theyd frown on my sleeping there overnight
RufusPeabody,but sometimes people dont realize theyre being lied to and manipulated. those are the people i want to protect
RufusPeabody,"why  daily fantasy sports  you and your ""pal"" just exchange info and bet without the operator taking a cut"
jeffma,anyone else replay the arya night king scene like you do a huge sports moment that went your way?
jeffma,yeah. we said so on the pod. that was the rufus lights futures tickets o fire in vegas episode
jeffma,thanks for clarification. i was in high school then so didnt know that. on the shoutout... wont happen again
jeffma,pats line at cris is -7 -105 so either someone knows something or there is made speculation going on
jeffma,i am not talking about u. i have no idea who u are or if u have missed anything
jeffma,ha ha... you think it was maddon that got them there? or maybe the amazing talent that theo assembled?
jeffma,the way bron is shooting free throws these days you have to foul him in these late game situations
jeffma,for the record that was sarcasm. i'm watching in a bar with all tar heel fans. praying for sadness
jeffma,i actually sat at 21st amendment many years ago and told nigel what a dumb idea fanduel was. #dontlistentome
jeffma,the  seem like a much improved team in many ways.... but seem like the same old  in many others
SportsCheetah,my thought was maybe he sees a swing and is just bailing in case there are a few more
SportsCheetah,i wrote about the game and some others coming up on chalk. also talked about it on the podcast
SportsCheetah,there was a decent one but byus wr was mysteriously in the way if it makes anybody feel better.
SportsCheetah,i think it should be 9 but can see market at 10/10.5. id definitely bet the 13 you mentioned.
SportsCheetah,not sure about that kyle. 4 yards. and 8 points isnt even a lock to tie with one possession.
SportsCheetah,whenever you can get a first down and turn around and go the other way you gotta do it.
SportsCheetah,fantasy wise probably similar but i bet williams over 37.5-46.5 rushing yards where i could get it as well.
SportsCheetah,a tie would decrease seattle's chances of winning the division... fewer games to make up the same 1.5-game deficit.
SportsCheetah,goffs 68 passing attempts will be tied for the third-most in a game in nfl history (bledsoe 70 1994).
SportsCheetah,no but we recorded our album with the lead singer of this one so maybe where you recognize them.
SportsCheetah,thanks had forgotten that they traded it.  that is  what i get for trying to think up some narratives.
SportsCheetah,haha tulane safety blitz on 3rd and 10 when houston in auto 4-down territory and king draw is -500
capjack2000,funny enough i had a very good day on thursday...almost like i had all the bad lines to myself.
capjack2000,oh and in that month november 2009 even with this wacky lines delaware sportsbooks had a 22.6 percent  hold.
capjack2000,"i've risen from the dead many times through mergers and acquisitions. 

i've also poisoned some accounts through mergers too."
capjack2000,"moneyline is -335/+275  for what  it is  worth . 

meanwhile oregon lottery dealing bal -3. 

i have no words..."
capjack2000,calculating edge is much more finite when dealing with a 52-card deck (or 312-card shoe). i miss those days.
capjack2000,why does the biggest european book bet365 have 1 percent  market share in nj and no presence in pa?
capjack2000,tons of tv commercials for it during local sporting events. not a lot of online ads about it though.
capjack2000,im sure the folks at bettor collective love that the article cites a catena media analysis of the industry.
capjack2000,the value of numbers drops off dramatically past 17 you are correct.  let us  see how they're priced though.
capjack2000,resorts! probably the most honest bookmaker in the state. the software isn't great but they take on all comers.
capjack2000,thats quite a delayed official launch. i remember watching nhl finals in that completed book a few months back.
capjack2000,"is that an airport lounge or sportsbook? 

there's a reason this seating model hasn't changed in 50 years...it works."
capjack2000,if gamblingtwitter ever turns against you this pic is going to be used more than the kellyinvegas bikini pics.
capjack2000,hey gill can i get a follow for purposes of a dm (or you could dm me your call).
capjack2000,teasers are mostly dead now...but keep shopping last year there were some operators who left themselves open to them.
capjack2000,dammit...boiling something down to fit in 240-chars sometimes makes for lousy copy. you guys know what i mean though.
capjack2000,i feel like that was written by a machine learning bot...one which is early on in the training phase.
capjack2000,off the top of my head the only two states with an official data mandate are tn and il.

dinkinc,i am sure you know your options better than me... people from the states sometimes go to costa rico
dinkinc,you are both great.  a little over my head sometimes but i do learn so much from you both
dinkinc,dont look at me.  i surrendered after blowing a 20 1/2 point fourth quarter lead in the last game
dinkinc,that was my far my favorite bola match because it went beyond my best expectaions...and my expectations were high
dinkinc,i feel bad for the under thirties who love horse racing now.  you all should have seen it then
dinkinc,just for the record both the guests are the real deal...frank is a friend and anthony is very legit
dinkinc,that is  cool... i was just thinking you might be casting doubt amongst the donors that this isn't legit
dinkinc,but you've never been a t.v. series... we need to ask  so we can have a more valid opinion
dinkinc,things must have changed since i left... i was careful and was robbed at least 5 times...well somewhat careful
robpizzola,if you  daily fantasy sports  think carolina can contend for the cup i got news for you... you're wrong.
robpizzola,missed the early number there; not loving +4 -111 although admittedly would still be a small play for me.
robpizzola,nothing is a lock but if i was a coach id be looking to increase my teams win expectancy.
robpizzola,36 takeaways on d last year... gonna be difficult for them to win without stealing possession again this year
robpizzola,the fact that you can actually hear an audible reaction from the fans in that ballpark says it all.
robpizzola,hard to use the upgrade when you board the plane and are just stuck on the tarmac for hours.
robpizzola,they are easy to play against. if opposing teams press and have someone shadow pjanic this team is hopeless.
robpizzola,yeah my average price is in the same range. i have true # of 138 with blackwood in net.

ProfessorShine,just pointing out that team x wants to be .500 isnt an angle.  its an action network-ish sales technique.
ProfessorShine,their information is full of nonsense trends and worthless public betting information.   there are better free options out there
ProfessorShine,theres some terrible diseases out there but dementia is some  awful shit.  especially if u were an avid reader.
ProfessorShine,flacco and balt had pats by the nuts and threw an endzone int on a 1st down i believe.
ProfessorShine,also  even if dubs were up 3-1 are they better without durant after a 35 game or so sample?
ProfessorShine,i have iggy bias because he wanted a-list cash in philly got it then realized hes a supporting guy.
ProfessorShine,my mom told me never gamble.  when i told her too late she said well dont kill anyone then
ProfessorShine,izzo has been a dog in almost all of the 12 head to head so not entirely his fault.
ProfessorShine,jack knows overtime course.   someone like  should probably consider using jack as a guest over salesmen like bruce marshall
suuma810,you see it in the next sequence when the toe touches finally the ground. but thats after this picture.

TheCousinSal,i know it seems impossible to believe at this point but i am actually playing against two other people.
TheCousinSal,the only 3 guarantees in life...death...taxes...and every single one of your fantasy players scoring the week after youre eliminated.
TheCousinSal,be nice this holiday season and support the fight against #als. you can win some pretty great stuff too
TheCousinSal,phil rivers short passes have the same zip as when hes throwing to his 17 six year old kids.
TheCousinSal,shades of denkinger in 85 if the nats lose this one. (except denkinger didnt have the benefit of replay)
TheCousinSal,fun times hanging with the thursday night crew. terry had diarrhea - we decided not to wait for him.
TheCousinSal,except for the part where it absolutely was. you dont need two feet down when youve crossed the plane.
TheCousinSal,i looked it up...offensively-speaking 14 points is better than 10. how does zimmer not challenge that thielen  touchdown ?
TheCousinSal,took the time to alphabetize his favorite vacation spots. the least you can do is give it a glance.
TheCousinSal,pistons fouling down 19 with 25 seconds left. presumably playing those who bet them on a 12 point teaser.
TheCousinSal,so wait...the guy who attacked bret the hitman hart wasnt the dumbest fan at a live sporting event tonight?
TheCousinSal,say what you will about  but the guy is a work horse.  take a look at that pitch count.
TheCousinSal,not sure how  can still be ranked number one when they havent covered the spread in 3 weeks. #razorbackdoor
TheCousinSal,wow! and just like that pat mahomes becomes the greatest left-handed qb in the history of the nfl. #kcvsden
TheCousinSal,david wright waited 2 and a half years and couldnt take a pitch? so impatient! welcome back captain! #mets
TheCousinSal,everyone called it. shame on all of us for not having the balls to bet gst by 22+ (7/2).
TheCousinSal,not even through 3 quarters...106 penalty yards and one team hasn't scored. this is a declaration of war. #nfluk
TheCousinSal,they didn't have to fix this decision.  there was going to be a rematch either way.  so sad. #gggvscanelo
TheCousinSal,stonie is a swell guybut i didn't sense the confidence needed to dethrone the champ.chestnut wins by 4 brats.
TheCousinSal,remember how u begged for a podcast where i reminisce about l.i. high school wrestling in the late '80s?
TheCousinSal,join me on my quest to go undefeated in week 12 on  one winner in.. two more to go
12Xpert,indeed winning is irrelevant. i actually had a negative balance at that shitshow ladbrokes when they closed my account.
12Xpert,47 teams. not sure if any others can be added for the first two seasons which played 42 games.
12Xpert,no they are when i collect the odds (typically friday afternoon for weekend games tuesday morning for midweek games).
12Xpert,"you'd have your betting accounts closed long before you got there unless you take ""measures"" to disguise your activity."
12Xpert,these will be games awarded by the fa mostly likely because the matches were abandoned due to crowd trouble.
12Xpert,wta tennis data up to date: hiroshima nanchang and zhengzhou. no atp this week on account of davis cup.
12Xpert,i hope he's not bluffing. this needs to be ended no matter how. endless can kicking serves nobody's interests.
12Xpert,wrong way round. hotter favourites cover the spread 50 percent  of the time not 50 percent  of the time.
12Xpert,was that the case with repeal the 8th? i thought post-result it still had to be passed by parliament.
12Xpert,who knows. all deals require concessions and if you  daily fantasy sports  get what you want you walk away.
12Xpert,overall since august 2015 the system is performing to expectation. actual 4.44 percent  expected 4.19 percent  from 8889 selections.
12Xpert,you obviously haven't the slightest idea what i am talking about and i also suspect probably you as well.
12Xpert,in fact there were 11095 matches that had at least 1 arb opportunity. 237 of them had all 3.
12Xpert,be amazed.  that is  how good pinny's closing odds are (on average) compared to everything else i've looked at.
12Xpert,"yes you can. all hangs on the word ""decent"". is it really?  that is  the 64 million dollar question."

mschwimer,so at the end of the 17 week package do you think we will be positive units or negative?
mschwimer,didn't miss much yesterday.  went 4-3.  go to  and click register.  the process shouldn't take more than 30 seconds.

mschwimer,i have done the unthinkable ... got a long distance girlfriend right before the season starts.  must be special
RufusPeabody,wedding isn't for awhile. just nice to detox and try to establish healthy habits every now and then.
RufusPeabody,the xroi makes sense. .5614/.5238-1. but  daily fantasy sports  know where you're getting your xroi with vig number
RufusPeabody,if someone wants to work for a salary with no upside then go ahead and work for draftkings.
RufusPeabody,that was docking bama 2 points for loss of tua. in reality  it is  probably closer to 3.
RufusPeabody,i was just trying to figure out in what way it was a black swan. am legitimately curious.
RufusPeabody,the fact that im too busy to get this together is further evidence i need to hire someone.
RufusPeabody,my buddy gave me some when i had awful amoebic dysentery in peru. made it a little better.
RufusPeabody,how is this a brag? point is posting winning tickets means nothing because no one sees the losers
RufusPeabody,i got a flu vaccine this year for the first time in my life. it wasnt my choice.
RufusPeabody,well thats false. less than 140k have tested positive. many people who have it have not been tested.
RufusPeabody,can't comment on the play calls but the timeout mgmt at the end of the 1h wasn't great.
jeffma,you all realize this is a good thing for gambling right? the more uninformed the masses the better
jeffma,huh? so you picked 4 games this weekend as your arbitrary quarterfinals. you should work for the ncaa
jeffma,that was tongue in cheek... of course i know a lot of people in the us watch soccer
jeffma,newest ep of  with where we discuss  and debate 4 vs 8 vs 16 in  college football  playoff
jeffma,6 seconds left on shot clock 30 some feet from hoop. i'd say risk is not worth return
jeffma,just seems like a small sample size that isn't stable over time. conceptually makes sense just hate trends
jeffma,guyer got hit by a pitch in 9 percent  if his plate appearances this year.  that is  crazy
jeffma,i want the bucs to get close just to see where they put the green  field goal  line
jeffma,congrats to the most dominant team at the olympics! had over twice as many goals as their competition!
jeffma,you probably would need to do some historical regressions to understand the distribution of vig as odds increase
jeffma,good luck today buddy! i'm sure you will crush it! red sox nation will be there for you
jeffma,ha ha. i always love the zags! part of me died last year when they lost to duke
jeffma,at dinner with   let us  see how he can turn this into a made for tv movie cc:
jeffma,can't wait to hear about it... might it have something to do with jimtown? i've been hearing rumors
jeffma,warriors analytics are off the chart because of all of their blowouts. they were historically good this year
jeffma,will take a deeper dive later but at first glance looks like a great read! thanks for sharing!
jeffma,a lot is true but a lot is made up also. the book is a bit more accurate.

robpizzola,steelers should sign colin kaepernick and convert mason rudolph to a safety. that was a great form tackle.
robpizzola,the interesting thing about that dalton pick six was that he threw a screen to literally no one.
robpizzola,very much looking forward to losing another under that was scoreless at the end of the first quarter.
robpizzola,i played over 45 -106... agreed would have been terrible based on how the game actually played out
robpizzola,this is an absolute joke at this point. four points off of basket interference and a kick ball.
robpizzola,theyve won expected goals at even strength in four of five games this series. its not a stretch.
robpizzola,it is so absurdly stupid that the canes didnt have the goalie out to start that power play.
robpizzola,devil's advocate would say that you have an increased risk of injury when you're running at full speed.
robpizzola,4 of 8 decided by 14 or more (math is hard)... gonzaga/fsu auburn/unc both entertaining late into 2h.
robpizzola,i have a bot that is pulling lines right from their api but i think sportsinsights would suffice
robpizzola,its just random variance... over 25 years theres only a 100 game sample size of 5 v. 12

suuma810,whats fascinating to me is that these folks always present new magic numbers which fits their non-predictive trend.
suuma810,the funny part is that the 5-7 eagles can still win the division and host a playoff game.
suuma810,has buf at 82 percent  to make the playoffs the other two are hovering around 30 percent .
suuma810,i had a very conservative projection for them going into the season but that was still vastly overrated.
suuma810,wrde es ja feiern wenn die jets auf 1 rutschen und dann irgendein qb-needy team die farm tradet.
suuma810,the #vikings have the worst run offense by far but their head coach intends on establishing the run.
suuma810,yeah but i would expect coaching changes to be made at the beginning of a team's bye week.
suuma810,"adam gase: 2-yard frank gore run on 2nd  10. deparation throw on 3rd - punt.

whats happening? 

#dolphins"

ClevTA,posted these friday and got the absolute best of every single line. probably means i lose all 5
ClevTA,these injury reports this week in the nfl are something. who is playing for the jets besides darnold?
ClevTA,huh? i made zero commentary about play selection. i was commenting on the ability to cite stats properly
ClevTA,i know u dont watch the nfl but u seriously dont think that gm was on him right?
ClevTA,fine man whatever if u want to spend all day distinguishing between levels of mistake have at it
ClevTA,well thats not totally true. books do take a stand sometimes so they dont always want equal action
ClevTA,what part of not making the case that the browns will win was not clear from my tweet?
ClevTA,u can when u play penn st and michigan b2b weeks after racking up a bunch of sacks
ClevTA,oh there will be a reckoning for those who tried to tell me he #wasgood before the draft
ClevTA,when two role players hit 9-11 from 3 thats not close to sustainable no matter what lebron does
ClevTA,if u are going to put a te on bosa just do a slip screen. will easily work
ClevTA,the pi was auto booth review bc it was on a  touchdown . they still had one left
ClevTA,why are u even punting on 4th and 5 from near midfield down 28-0? what is that #michigansucks
ClevTA,jags havent even tried a toss or sweep with fournette. up the middle every time probably is predictable
ClevTA,i dont know. but harris could be a dart throw first  touchdown  if they do go more 12
ClevTA,going to have to fade a jameis pick 6 or scoop and score off a fumble arent i
ClevTA,they chose not to give him an extension months ago. him sitting out was 100 percent  their doing

spanky,hey  . i think we need to ask  what his secret is to get asher to talk about
spanky,contests meaning capping contests or games? i rarely if ever enter contests. games i bet a lot of.

Ccon8181,that went down in flames quick. should of expected it. 0-1 night wrong foot to start the week
kellyinvegas,if i could get a pick 6 here to push/win on my bowl pool(s) that would be incredible
kellyinvegas,and i were just talking about how i miss the old helmets. jerseys. meh. helmets need to stay.
kellyinvegas,i also had the lions in that game lol. just couldnt give it out. had moved too much.
kellyinvegas,think im going with the  crew. interesting line. looks like its spot on but situationally has me intrigued
kellyinvegas,sometimes  and i fight before shows. sometimes we fight during the show. never know what youre gonna get
kellyinvegas,minty and i dont sell picks. but hey this dude has been obsessed since 2013. so why not.
kellyinvegas,i dont think were all that different. but ive only been to western canada. i really enjoyed it.
kellyinvegas,not a bad morning. 3-1 on the  show to start the day. three more pending for the week.

TheCousinSal,im still not confident virginia can hold this lead up 8 with no time left in ot. #marchmadness2019
TheCousinSal,dont let the forced smiles fool you. this is going to be an unmitigated disaster. #lockitin #gambling #vegasbaby
TheCousinSal,clippers tonight...lakers a couple  nights ago. i think its fair to say that la once again owns boston.

TheCousinSal,i go jacobs over murray and tomlin over harbaugh. otherwise everything seems to be in order. carry on.
TheCousinSal,the bills are trying so hard to lose this game. i actually think they can make it happen.
12Xpert,jesus daniel can't you just give a reds fan his moment. you sound as boring as i do.
12Xpert,here's the league table for a team's worst ever consecutive 38-game points total. one of wenger's major achievements.
12Xpert,there will be a big favourite-longshot bias on this market so may just focus on the shortest prices.
12Xpert,its still possible that its not real or that if it was real once its been exploited away.
12Xpert,based on those charts arsenal cant defend tottenham cant do anything and man united can go to hell.
12Xpert,i had to read that 5 times to get my head round that. still not sure i have.
12Xpert,did i ever say i would do this? bet of the day is basically silly. because of variance.
12Xpert,and here was me thinking society was actually starting to care about mental health. i must have misunderstood.
12Xpert,i would expect them to say it controls too much uk market share. yes skybet would be included.
12Xpert,i very much doubt it but best price held about 4 percent  value according the the woc method.
12Xpert,if the result had been opposite would you argue the same and insist there is a second referendum?
12Xpert,the likes of tom watson have already be found wanting when taking this holier than thou approach. #harveyproctor.
12Xpert,i've also explained why other bookmakers are worse e.g. they choose to be it suits their business model.
12Xpert,and if  that is  the case beating the market becomes largely a coin flipping exercise (for almost everyone).

mschwimer,while that might be true. doesnt change the fact that our subscribers will be profitable in this scenario.
mschwimer,should be a very large media platform to come out with a story on us tomorrow. stay tuned.
mschwimer,please see the 3 part tweet i just sent.  big news on the guarantee! we are making moves.
mschwimer,cool. also we post picks for the day at 11amet or later. so we never get early lines.
mschwimer,we are in a great spot. but never underestimate how bad the orioles bullpen is.  4 more outs!

RufusPeabody,also those small bettors are generally playing parlays. if they hit suddenly it matters to them too.
RufusPeabody,when i woke up today i didnt know it would be a zylbo day. but it is
RufusPeabody,right i haven't been attacking jambos on their picks;  it is  been on the scammy touty stuff.
RufusPeabody,we've always discussed the tout industry and the tricks touts use to try to pad their records.
RufusPeabody,looked like the alabama db might have tipped it first also which would mean no illegal touching.
RufusPeabody,yeah wasn't great. but that point you were going to need to recover the onside kick anyway.
RufusPeabody,i wish i could track my picks on there. alas making my predictions public would be self-defeating.
RufusPeabody,kamara would be ahead of him by about .13 wins if they played equal number of snaps.
RufusPeabody,"my highest graded nfl week 2 performances:
ne sf kc lar dal cle buf tb ind sea"
RufusPeabody,i wonder what  percent  of plays you have illegal contact those goes uncalled. guessing its pretty high.
RufusPeabody,i mean my  college football  is losing today too so jambos and i have that in common.
RufusPeabody,we should just hire someone to do most of the weekly stuff but i have trust issues.
RufusPeabody,20 times the price of the pick (meaning how much you paid the tout for the pick)
RufusPeabody,it does capture some of the effect but im just being a fan right now and reacting
RufusPeabody,the angle part is just a way to try to explain the way of thinking more clearly.
RufusPeabody,whatever you feel is the most efficient market. if thats a combo of them then use that
RufusPeabody,i think there will be wayyyyy more vegetables relative to proteins. there just aren't that many proteins.
RufusPeabody,that is  not surprising. but with few exceptions they post a limit and that applies to everyone.
RufusPeabody,we need more guys like  running books and more books like  (listen to the full interview )
jeffma,have you rewatched that play? it was hardly an egregious no call. your process missed a layup
jeffma,but you started this whole argument by saying there were playoffs today implying the system was fine
jeffma,only good thing about the onside kick is he got to have the ball at the end
jeffma,.  at least he didn't tell you you looked like someone who didn't have much money and...
jeffma,i  daily fantasy sports  know what you are talking about. i  daily fantasy sports  watch the bachelor
jeffma,i just  daily fantasy sports  understand why you hate the pats. they beat you fair and square
jeffma,yeah. but  it is  a bit of over coaching. only brad stevens is allowed to do that
jeffma,cavs seem to be making a conscious effort to shoot fewer threes. #badidea they should embrace variance
jeffma,thanks for the response. curious if there was ever a resolution to this similar issue involving nover.
jeffma,just saw #americansniper. intense and amazing! go see it!  i have your bootleg copy on my iphone
jeffma,i was actually controlling you by dragging the dot across the screen... you have me to thank...
SportsCheetah,some people enjoy a breakdown and process whether theres a pick or not. other people are you.
SportsCheetah,huh? he had him beat but was turning around since it was so underthrown and then slipped.
SportsCheetah,ive had this in utah and there is one in summerlin as well. i really like it.
SportsCheetah,i'm just letting it ride but yeah in theory could still hedge and lock up a profit.
SportsCheetah,lol that means you bet under 66 and it closed 70.5 good luck with that going forward!
SportsCheetah,i dont think ive ever seen an exclamation mark after buy points before must be a steal.
SportsCheetah,can we pay somebody to go through and see what his 3pt percent  is on these attempts
SportsCheetah,nothing for me in that one. no fox as im sure youre aware but just in case.
SportsCheetah,11.1 percent  yup thanks... was breaking news they asked us on the fly was off a little.
SportsCheetah,kawhi 7/21 and clippers 3/23 from 3 as a team and only down 1 is fairly impressive.
SportsCheetah,clearly everybody is aware already but in case you missed it somehow tyus jones revenge game tonight.
SportsCheetah,not with matt moore at qb and a game plan that is likely slower and run heavy
SportsCheetah,yeah his ability to throw down the field midseason dropped off severely. i dont think its unreasonable.
SportsCheetah,mark him out at the 2 to take away a byu  touchdown  come on wasn't even close.
SportsCheetah,2 pats and a 30-yarder to win down the pipe yikes what school did he go to
capjack2000,oh i know...and considering the intrinsic line value with the stale lines this is even more remarkable.
capjack2000,"...and  that is  not even 15 percent . 

a bad look for a normally good book pointsbet."
capjack2000,resorts is more than fair. the software interface isn't the friendliest but they take action from anyone.
capjack2000,good time to remind everyone that nj books can not unilaterally cancel wagers without approval from njdge.
capjack2000,i've never been a fan of preseason futures wagers. i have made some futures wagers in-season though.
capjack2000,"if you only knew. 

im not sure how im going to pay for all these russian bots."
capjack2000,great promo. glad to see this kind of innovation working its way into the las vegas market!
capjack2000,ugh you had to fly spirit? even for a 1  hour flight thats a bridge too far.
capjack2000,"be careful twitter...he means danish krone (dk). which is worth about $15 usd. 

ie: one max bet"
capjack2000,tough to say but rates for super bowl weekend were south of $200/nt and plenty of availability.

robpizzola,i'm talking about the patriots being a better team if they had jimmy g under center today.
robpizzola,this could be the worst quarterback play ive ever seen across a nine game slate. absolutely pathetic.
robpizzola,was planning on going both nights but was severely jet lagged yesterday. really looking forward to this.
robpizzola,when its 2019 and you judge people on the internet without knowing a single thing about them.
robpizzola,im diabetic so i try to do the same... could be a matter of life or death!
robpizzola,a player would literally need to be murdered on the field for them to overturn a pi
robpizzola,perfect play from the dolphins to make it look like theyre not intentionally tanking. job well done.
robpizzola,hmmm i wonder if id rather have the 6 goals or the 26 penalty minutes. tough call.
robpizzola,took a shitty number on over in dal/nyg. that garbage time  touchdown  saved me. lucky. very lucky.
robpizzola,lots of studies done on why you shouldnt trade up in the draft. im not the idiot.
robpizzola,believe me ive never been a fan but i think hes in a great situation this year.
robpizzola,need albion to take out bottas and somehow also take out hamilton as part of that wreckage.
robpizzola,there are so many things wrong with this comparison that i wouldnt even know where to start.
robpizzola,anyone wanna tell me what the bucks against the spread record is after a loss? *fart noise*
robpizzola,last two seasons are very good but my god it was really really painful for a while.
robpizzola,don cherry about to come on which makes it a good time to do literally anything else.
robpizzola,life lessons to be learned here.  daily fantasy sports  have kids and  daily fantasy sports  wear clothes.
robpizzola,i would rather own a washington ticket but i dont think either of those are +ev wagers.
RASPicks,asking for a friend.... how far did you sit from each other?  how big was the group?
RASPicks,no but we also  daily fantasy sports  ask for more money when we far exceed expectations either.
RASPicks,no one selling picks changed the market.  easy access to better ways to make a number did.
RASPicks,update on our 7-day  college basketball  service free trial and some tips for the final three days.
RASPicks,that is probably true but even against close you would still be a huge loser fading them.
RASPicks,30+ minutes after cris goes full 5k limits  groups start firing isn't when market is most volatile.
RASPicks,is anyone other than betonline going to put up totals for the two college football games tonight?
RASPicks,actually we won +30 units in 10 weeks of service.  maybe have us confused with someone else?
RASPicks,nothing special leaned ny already and confirmed aisha jones out for ct shortly before tweeting the play.
RASPicks,no worries guys still put out 2nd halves and other good stuff here on twitter for free.
RASPicks,besides the fact that we may analyze data differently why assume we are looking at identical information?
RASPicks,outside shooting looks like it could be challenging on the uss carl vinson even if no wind.
RASPicks,detailed categorical breakdown of ras  college football  and  college basketball  records from the past 3 seasons: .co/1yethdys

suuma810,"saw an ad from an online book saying ""we pay the betting tax for you"". good stuff:"

-hard workers

suuma810,great job this season guys! keep up the good work  thanks for having me on the show!
suuma810,according to current reports the snow will stop soon which should make up for a good pitch.
suuma810,because  it is  not an easy road game for an unproven offense. dolphins significantly better at home.
suuma810,i think the offense was good overall. he had some bad throws but also some costly drops.
suuma810,daily fantasy sports  buy the 0.5 shop for it. if it isn't warranted mathematically play the -3.
ClevTA,curious why u waited till this morning to make this bet. it was out there all week
ClevTA,man i hope ppl are really taking mixon out of their dk lineups. doing me a favor

spanky,laying the price will never be graded.  betting the dog here is more likely to be graded.
spanky,not sure if the rule applies to the pitcher staying in the game albeit at another position
spanky,most important question is beating the closing number majority of the time.  every other question is irrelevant.
spanky,you never take a favorite. you lay the favorite and take the dog. ask  and  for explanation

PlusEVAnalytics,depends....wheres all this revenue coming from and where is it currently going if not to the players?
PlusEVAnalytics,this seems like something that nobody wants or will ever play. and for that reason im out.

nonrandomalpha,"supercontest week 3 picks...always got me feelin' like 

2018: 61 percent 
2019 (y touchdown ): 60 percent"
nonrandomalpha,this is some amazing work and further emphasizes the futility of reading too much into preseason performances.
LeeSharpeNFL,one offseason was never going to fix it. which is why it exactly is like accepting flacco.

whale_capper,amazingly this has happened 22 times since they went to the 8-div format (h/t  for the graphic)
whale_capper,not many wrong answers but i'm usually firing pilsner-style cervezas like bohemia or pacifico during the draft
whale_capper,"to supplement this week's deep dive... here are the back-calc'd ""vegas"" power numbers using the lookahead lines:"

12Xpert,much smaller than for results. typically about 50 to 100 should be enough. this article explains more.

RufusPeabody,half-point ppr. title game. 30 percent  win probability at the moment. miles sanders or amari cooper?
RufusPeabody,this week's  is up discussing bowl game handicapping with  and going over all the pre-christmas games.
RufusPeabody,90 percent  of my timeline is people giving booger shit. i dont have the volume on.
RufusPeabody,that doesnt change the expectation. it has an effect on your probability which is what matters
RufusPeabody,how much of that was actually opponent strength vs. perception of opponent strength at the time.
RufusPeabody,joe flacco inadvertently made a great argument for why he shouldnt be starting for the broncos.
RufusPeabody,honestly im not talking about any specific companies. just from my experience at those trade shows.
RufusPeabody,good point. the optimal usage rate isnt zero but fades are certainly overused in todays nfl
RufusPeabody,i loved the bankers and manager at my local branch in vegas. but thats about it.
RufusPeabody,"hawk power ratings: 
1.  
2. seattle seahawks

RufusPeabody,i never have worked for a book. closest thing was my time at lvsc in 2008-2009
RufusPeabody,plenty of governments would do the same thing if they thought their image could be tarnished.
RufusPeabody,was this day-of mlb sides joey? would like to see a pic if thats the case
RufusPeabody,i've come to realize i'm really not good at pronouncing my own name so it helps.
RufusPeabody,though my business partner apparently had one recently so maybe it wasnt an excuse after all.
RufusPeabody,"2018 heritage: kodaira 317/1

RufusPeabody,yass: customers in europe not price sensitive. unless consumers are price sensitive exchanges wont take off.

SportsCheetah,newport one is the second one thats where ive eaten in the past though its phenomenal.
SportsCheetah,to be fair they just said he missed it 40 yards left from the right hash.
SportsCheetah,yeah we both moved on to beards and computer simulation death by the end of it
SportsCheetah,i mean he just did it again and then put on the kings crown. end it.
SportsCheetah,remembering the days the heat were up 14 with 1-minute left to go in the 1h.
SportsCheetah,i followed up looking at the numbers in four games in these spots in week 15
SportsCheetah,i didnt bring grinch up there are obviously question marks about the ou d always are.
SportsCheetah,one person seems to be getting a lot more than the other out of this arrangement
SportsCheetah,i mean the tight end slipped wide open. the kid just threw it to the turf.
SportsCheetah,someone had videos in a thread i tweeted a bit later  for what  it is  worth
SportsCheetah,bev hounding harden off ball so hard he hasnt even touched it the last 4 possessions.
SportsCheetah,week 10 nfl fantasy/betting market assessment 3 games to avoid (and now no stafford for detroit)
SportsCheetah,this is the first time the patriots have trailed in a regular season game since 2011.
SportsCheetah,if you played wvu with me from daily wager today i played baylor back -7.5 2h.
SportsCheetah,larry the cable guy could probably win 6 or 7 of the browns next 7 games.
SportsCheetah,the dodgers pay him to do what the front office says and keep the players happy.
SportsCheetah,just juiced out betting the game live didn't get involved pregame feel for you brother. all-timer.
SportsCheetah,nothing much just project the game like +2.8 so would take +3.5 if i had to
capjack2000,it is certainly not upstanding behavior. ive seen it happen on major sports for less too.
capjack2000,its parimutuel. good luck finding an edge when the track takes ~17 percent  off the top.
capjack2000,online poker in limited liquidity pools is a dead-end product. the fascination will wear off quickly.
capjack2000,you'll have plenty of opportunity as certain books will soon be running yankees promos for october.
capjack2000,"looks like i've reached 5000 followers. 

thanks for finding this stuff as interesting as i do!"
capjack2000,a $1000 5-team parlay by the assemblywoman...bold choice but you've got to raise re-election funds somehow.
capjack2000,i suspect the reason they do the podcast is for the pre and post show conversations.
capjack2000,one look at atlantic city and the racetracks and youd know felony convictions dont prevent entrance.
capjack2000,interesting. it might save betamerica in nj. i had them exiting the nj market ~march 2020.
capjack2000,yikes...here come the flood of sharps that will explain that johnny didn't treat all bettors equally.
capjack2000,should run a parallel contest where you try to beat a cockatoo which blindly makes picks.
capjack2000,looks like this will be the first online skin for either freehold or garden state park.

dinkinc,1-1 mlb   2-0 nhl.....   life is good again and the   horses breathe a sigh of relief....
robpizzola,theres nothing quite like a 28-yard missed field goal that affects both the side and total.
robpizzola,if we had 30 eric cohens coaching in the nfl i could sleep easy at night.
robpizzola,that reminded me of joe haden from five years ago. what a break on the ball.
robpizzola,always a good look when you give up more shorthanded goals than you actually score overall.
robpizzola,yeah its always the right call to give your opponent more possessions than you in overtime.
robpizzola,moreso a guy that recognizes that over 99 percent  of the population is going to lose.
robpizzola,if you bet the over on fuck yeahs in this post-game celebration thats an easy winner.
robpizzola,even on a weekend where ferrari dominates they cant pull out a win. that kinda year.
robpizzola,i think he muted me after i told him he was very wrong on this gem.
robpizzola,my point is that were used to seeing him being a complete bag of burning garbage.
RASPicks,good question.  that year we did full game sides and totals and stopped releasing in mid-january.
RASPicks,for one the best of the best have losing seasons especially in the bigger pro markets.
RASPicks,retract your statement that we took a lucrative private deal instead of offering a totals service.
RASPicks,we can't prevent sportsbooks from subscribing as long as the service is available to the public.
RASPicks,sometimes cris is best sometimes cris is worst.  not everyone has access to exact same books.
RASPicks,152 at betonline bookmaker and pinn at time of tweet most sites copy one of these.
RASPicks,the market agreeing with and/or validating your play is what makes beating the close so important.
RASPicks,yes done with football this season unless we add something late.   college basketball  starts nov 7th.

ProfessorShine,the 90s were very bad yes.   the league has an additional zillion awful rules now too
ProfessorShine,not to be negative but entire southpoint entire casino smells like horseshit due to some rodeo
ProfessorShine,it is incredible how  just turned their head on this like that cop in the town.
ProfessorShine,keane and millman arent real clear about tan business model even if the previous ceo was
ProfessorShine,kerr was 18-1 in g1s and capping the series seemed so automatic.   what the fuck  happened
ProfessorShine,fran dunphy temple exit was uneasy too. cosby money for recruiting dried up everyone was affected
ProfessorShine,using widely available lines is usually a standard for even free picks or else its pointless

suuma810,the broncos were vastly overrated going into the week but this is a complete no show.
suuma810,the scoring didnt match up with the efficiency it was expected to regress at some point.
suuma810,when you are down 10-21 but try to establish the run against an elite run defense.
suuma810,im on browns +3. to me these are two different teams from a couple weeks ago.
suuma810,100 percent  agree. its like schotty doesnt know what to call when the run doesnt work.
suuma810,the #bears just got bet up to -5 at bookmaker  betonline.  that is  a bold line.

kellyinvegas,yes. because this graphic is every single bowl game. im clearly not betting every bowl game.
kellyinvegas,have to click the link and download the stat sheet. best bet will be on there.
kellyinvegas,smart man. that cash out was actually better than hedging out. i just did the math.
kellyinvegas,she is definitely not. panthers are a wild card right now. sure looks like theyve quit.
kellyinvegas,just cant. i have to work wednesday morning. so would have to fly out by 6am.
kellyinvegas,how did i know when  took this photo it would be my most liked post ever
kellyinvegas,sounds terrible. vegas sounds way better. get on a saturday late flight or early sunday am.
kellyinvegas,damn. thats some juice. so essentially youre getting all of that first group at under 3.
kellyinvegas,i dont. no big opinion on that game. but the panthers will be focused at home.
kellyinvegas,15 years ago i was in high school  also feel free to check out my insta
kellyinvegas,im only half as big as an asshole in real life as i am on here

ToddFuhrman,but this doesn't help you win...and hasn't proven it will actually accomplishes the exact opposite ha
ToddFuhrman,hey  lets get this taken care of sooner rather than later; football season is almost here!
ToddFuhrman,wont be many fleeting moments to get a live tennis bet in mid-game thats for sure
ToddFuhrman,that is  the kind of comment that could get you blocked or muted around these parts!
ToddFuhrman,"yep given character limitatons didn't include the ""no"" price but all can be bet both ways"
ToddFuhrman,im sure he can call mark jackson and ask for suggestions on coping in the aftermaths
ToddFuhrman,emotion is the enemy of profit...words to live by in sports betting and the financial markets
ToddFuhrman,correct thats the part that left me going this is how were going to resolve things?
ToddFuhrman,dont get me started... and i have kind of thrown in the towel on this topic
ToddFuhrman,remember kid there's heroes and there's legends: heroes get remembered but legends never die - sandlot
ToddFuhrman,how old were you when you made your first bet and do you remember the game?
TheCousinSal,brady looks indecisive and skittish. i may actually allow  to complain about him tonight without interrupting.
TheCousinSal,this packers -6.5 play is either a genius freebie or the sucker bet of the millennium.
TheCousinSal,im starting to think the nfl isnt going to let the cowboys pick today. bummer. #nfldraft19
TheCousinSal,i hope all of the leaders wear lilac shirts again tomorrow. not confusing at all. #masters2019
TheCousinSal,bang up job by the dude who installed these trick rims at cameron indoor stadium. #dukecheats
TheCousinSal,congratulations to my pal  for being more famous than ever. he actually predicted this would happen
TheCousinSal,the bengals are a dynamite week 17 team.  how can you possibly let marvin lewis go?
TheCousinSal,i can sort of see what the bears were thinking there...11 points likely wins this mess.
TheCousinSal,hear me now believe me later...sean mcvay is better than all other nfl head coaches combined.
TheCousinSal,even our very own president would have to agree that the washington post nailed this article...
TheCousinSal,im starting to think my  arent as good as everyone says.  just kidding. they totally are.

TheCousinSal,"thunder might've lost by 40 if not for the very distracting and effective ""cupcake"" chant. #gswvsokc"
TheCousinSal,outside temperature for all games. clarification should be in the post below the video. best wishes.
12Xpert,no idea. he must have the data ordered differently to me. here's 2019 on its own.
12Xpert,indeed  that is  the point and would be one explanation for why inefficiencies might sometimes exist.
12Xpert,oh i do that all the time but try to enjoy the cognitive angst it generates.
12Xpert,it is  a bit like you  daily fantasy sports  like gambling and think  it is  wrong.
12Xpert,have published my thoughts on this. fair play to them it was virtually word for word.
12Xpert,last week's tennis data now available (umag newport bastad lausanne and bucharest) apologies for the wait.
12Xpert,all those who include weather into the statistical modelling of sporting contests please step forward now.
JambosPicks,please see below for our #superbowlliv prop plays. all lines from  as of 10:45 am et.

JambosPicks,jambos #mlb winning streak comes to an end with our #royals moneyline play taking an l.
JambosPicks,yes the 17-week package covered the entire nfl season so we stopped selling it last tuesday.
JambosPicks,"whats better than one winner? two winners!

boise state-florida state over 53.5 
boise state-florida state  +6.5"
JambosPicks,"4 hours 17 runs and 12 pitchers later our #rays moneyline play is a winner! 

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,"boom! #rockies finish off the win and  it is  a double winner for jambos subscribers! 

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,"speaking of 5-0 leads...our #twins moneyline play isnt looking too shabby  

*knocks on all the wood*"
JambosPicks,one play up on the podcast today. 22-15 in our tourney picks. #gamblingtwitter #bestbets #hoopstourney #sportsbets
mschwimer,unlike  i  daily fantasy sports  run and hide from intellectual conversations about the sports betting industry.
mschwimer,thank you to the subscriber that sent me this.  clearly betcris does allow it.  just #facts.
mschwimer,listen to the jambos podcast with  i explain it mathematically step by step. even pv agreed!
mschwimer,using that logic there is 0 percent  on anything in life. which is actually probably true.
mschwimer,happy to talk on the phone if you would like! lets get this on the books!
mschwimer,"yikes. thats not good bob. 

better it happened yesterday than when we go live on tuesday!"
mschwimer,not only will we have them. they should be our best sports in terms of predictability.
mschwimer,fanduel graded it as a cardinal win and over win. draftkings graded both as no action.
mschwimer,""" former cavalier ballplayer needs our help! .co/ak4n5h1wtx"" if u r a uva fan please read"
mschwimer,is this hockey stuff true? or is someone making up lies to get my hopes up?
mschwimer,""" i can't believe the new season is already starting! looking forward to it!"" get it!"
mschwimer,depends how u define smart.  he is into his chee. cack dude is into his shuffle
mschwimer,u got me hooked on suits... still on the first season but me and  love it
mschwimer,do u think u will get more pigs or rays fans to follow u on twitter?
mschwimer,my boy  is playing andy murray in the first round of the us open... miracle me!
mschwimer,just woke up and realized there is a schwim-fans facebook page now... this made my morning
mschwimer,no i cant write for phuture phillies anymore... i really wish i could... i love writing
RufusPeabody,i want to see  take on  preston said hed go head to head. cmon zylbo...
RufusPeabody,that is  how i think of it too. i know i'm the minority view here.
RufusPeabody,i love this thread. and 12 years ago one word lines were all the rage.
RufusPeabody,same goes with finance. warren buffett's success could have been strictly the product of variance.
RufusPeabody,depends on how much you plan on spending! short answer: 25 times your annual expenses.
RufusPeabody,neil when calculating the patriots' opponents strength are you omitting when they play that pats?
RufusPeabody,yes but i disagree. taking bets youre getting the wisdom of a bunch of algos
RufusPeabody,i guess this marks the 8th straight season i've watched zero nba games on tv.
RufusPeabody,dont know why he didnt do it earlier. much easier to spread misinformation without pushback
RufusPeabody,we live in a time where facts have become subjective. this is typical tout spin
RufusPeabody,great thread on how next gen stats in the nfl are and will be used
RufusPeabody,more important question -- why are you against appearing on neutral turf? makes me wonder...
RufusPeabody,i  daily fantasy sports  play nfl  daily fantasy sports  either. i'm just an onlooker here.
jeffma,sorry meant stevie s who always defends him and piles on whoever he is attacking
jeffma,if you answer all the questions on twitter i will have nothing to ask you
jeffma,we got a different producer. yeah we should switch back. that was a good one
jeffma,i like that. if i win maybe i choose some sort of dog rescue charity
jeffma,how can you say wilt? 100 point game and some other mind blowing stats :)
jeffma,ha ha. the funny thing is i think they know exactly where it is going
jeffma,we need more dlee in this game said someone with the rockets and the over
jeffma,wow! you should probably quit your job and just bet with that win rate! congrats!
jeffma,if the indians get this close do you think maddon will bring in his closer?
jeffma,i'm about to tally up my fantasy points with pen and paper old school. #thanksespn
jeffma,to make a 20 cent line the books must be comfortable with the liquidity. cc:
jeffma,i won the over on deladova to injure someone. paid double if it was himself
jeffma,"i'll see if i can work it in to the conversation like ""home video solutions"""
jeffma,i feel like houston is winning this game in spite of how it is playing
jeffma,never done it that way so hard for me to know. live auction is fun
SportsCheetah,no points in santa clara and i took uga +7.5s -120 or better for tomorrow.
SportsCheetah,def up there considering orlando is 28th in e field goal  percent  as a team
SportsCheetah,"that is  why i mentioned ""going into today"" i didn't include the recoveries from today."
SportsCheetah,explains a good amount of it as does my  college football  season this year haha
SportsCheetah,the grizz just scored 3 points the final 7 minutes of that 3q. not great.

SportsCheetah,jeez the  album debuted at #26 on billboard  that is  insane. making hardcore great again.
SportsCheetah,and on the 5th week the lord said thou shalt not bet moneyline round robins.
SportsCheetah,i bet cyclones but  it is  basically pk now so didn't use them for this
capjack2000,i did. if draftkings is your states only legal sportsbook you wouldnt have that luxury.
capjack2000,you may be right. i know stadium (cordish) did strike a deal with someone though.
capjack2000,la is risky place to park your team on the road for a few nights.
capjack2000,45 still not higher than 5 percent  probability...not worth the point buy at 10 cents.
capjack2000,is this the datafeed that is only $5000 for nv books? why wouldn't they pay?
capjack2000,just alfaro...from 2016 i believe. just a random pregame encounter at a reading phillies game.
capjack2000,i dont fight down in these trenches but its tough not to smirk at this
capjack2000,that was the line to sign up for mobile. foolish. its 2019. go mobile nevada...
capjack2000,ben franklin too...via tv commercials that run during every televised sporting event in the state.
capjack2000,correct. fortunately for you bet365 exited retail sportsbetting a while back and prefers online only.
capjack2000,wouldnt you love to listen in on a phone call between asher and robbins now?
capjack2000,there's a billion dollar industry in multiple states that would pay handsomely for first-mover advantage.
capjack2000,he was espn's editorial director. that position is pretty much built on your journalistic integrity.

robpizzola,probably the guy that blow dries his junk in the locker room too. sick fuck.
robpizzola,havent had a good dick-measuring competition on twitter in a while. this should be fun.
robpizzola,cant blame boston for the slow start considering they havent played in a calendar year.
robpizzola,that must be why 69 percent  of everyone who starts this series never finishes it.
robpizzola,no company aims to solve problems that  daily fantasy sports  exist more than twitter does.
robpizzola,coyotes +144 is about a 2 percent  edge if you're into that sort of thing.
robpizzola,probably hamiltons year again but ferrari did some decent practice times. hopefully an interesting year.
RASPicks,i couldn't agree with you more.  not everyone has those types of resources available though.

PlusEVAnalytics,because you need a math degree to figure out the value of what youre buying.
PlusEVAnalytics,the value of this product is obscured by randomness. thats why consumers need extra protection.

aluckyaday,no wonder the european bookies are falling over themselves to get in to the states!
aluckyaday,i did say that in an earlier tweet. here is the answer to your question.
aluckyaday,i would think 365 will be a personal limit depending on how they profile you.
aluckyaday,what about the guys that were not at the top when the stage was cancelled!
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  know enough about statistics to pick an argument with an actuary.
aluckyaday,not difficult to guess who most of the 16 with negative expected value are though!

12Xpert,in other words things they cannot help like mental health predispositions autism narcissism sociopathy etc.
12Xpert,"""whisper it softly but gambling can even be a positive and healthy activity for adults."""
12Xpert,i'd trust someone on twitter telling me they have an positive expected value even less.
12Xpert,once we know its more systematic we can then start to explore the reasons why.
12Xpert,what the data and analysed showed is that the closing prices cannot be fully efficient
12Xpert,this was it. of course it all hinges on the closing line being fully efficient.
12Xpert,what side of the arb does pinnacle sit? you probably know but here's some data

ProfessorShine,be prepared for carroll doing 4-5 really dumb things and wilson bailing him out
ProfessorShine,in gold ignoring it late is game theory.  in regular contest it is ignorance.
ProfessorShine,winston with almost 30ints is very favre-like.  i see why he wants 30mil per
ProfessorShine,i dont read im max betting it in erics timeline.  he probably just forgot
ProfessorShine,give the $20 to a local dog shelter and read the free sites instead
ProfessorShine,that crappy website he owned got him his way in with guys like cowherd.
ProfessorShine,underrated often unmentioned great part of redzone is announcers are at a bare minimum.
ProfessorShine,ex-nfl players besides romo seem to always be shocked going for 4th and short
ProfessorShine,the winners of the contest got there by luck and not skill is accurate
ProfessorShine,i envy the love mcvey has for  field goal  attempts on 4th and short.
ProfessorShine,yeah but 3 team payouts at  shines strip worldwould adjust to fool the  types.
ProfessorShine,the dn opened easily like a book and everyone read it back to front.
ProfessorShine,if you understood 33 percent  from 3 is good you wouldnt be at kutztown.
ProfessorShine,u despise agreeing with me when u know nfl sides are much larger limits
ProfessorShine,be smart to have 1st episode have some deaths right out of the gate.
ProfessorShine,if cal coached in piaa group 4 hed be like the 15th best coach

suuma810,yeah  it is  part of the betonline network but has lower margins. can recommend!
suuma810,weekly #nfl game analysis  picks until the super bowl! get on board for 2019:

suuma810,three months until the draft but i read  mock draft and am already hyped.
suuma810,i doubt that rhodes plays today. will be tough to defend gordon  edelman too.
suuma810,just realized the texans will play their first home game since 10/25 tomorrow. #randominfo
suuma810,#colts just got bet up to -3 after the amari cooper trade became public.
suuma810,he might be a decent mismatch in space for the pats d this week.
suuma810,imagine they beat out the giants for the potential best qb in the draft.
ClevTA,u apparently dont understand the voodoo the seahawks put on tms. its truly remarkable
ClevTA,sorry i only live in a world of receipts. self  or it didnt happen
ClevTA,wow buckeyes may have gotten away with delay of game on that wilson pass
ClevTA,booger is normally horrendous but tonight hes taken it to another level. its excruciating
ClevTA,rip kirk mvp. was already hanging by a thread but this just buried it

CizzlingSports,no one with an above-jeph-level-iq does this so this tweet makes cents i gueszz
CizzlingSports,self-proclaimed betting expert can't find a single +ev mlb bet in 2+ months shock-stun
CizzlingSports,you can just edit you are  picks and make the total lower tho right?

spanky,either way sportsbooks should automove derivatives or better yet keep supporting snipers like me.
spanky,what do you find wrong with table 2 particularly the nba 2386 bets placed?
spanky,the parties they had up there made the playboy mansion look like a library.
spanky,nothing beats driving in costa rica where red lights are merely suggested stop signs

DocBettor,nice sometimes the other side could be missing something too. see this recent thread
DocBettor,disagree with texas dolly here. live in-game betting has been good to me  #gamblingtwitter
DocBettor,mostly comparing actual results to pregame but for sure if certain events warrant it
DocBettor,agreed! impressed by  innovation. a year ago opener wasnt part of the baseball lexicon
DocBettor,bucks / raptors under 227 live with 3 minutes left in the 1st quarter
PlusEVAnalytics,if youre betting at a rebate shop yes. your uncle at the track no.
PlusEVAnalytics,id use 2.5 * (3.5/2.5) * (3.5/2.5) = 4.9 in this made up example.
PlusEVAnalytics,was that bengals  field goal  really from 44 line of scrimmage was the 29?
PlusEVAnalytics,teach probability instead of trigonometry. then you get the game show thing for free.
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont know who this co-host is but i did a way better job
PlusEVAnalytics,updating from ios 13.2 to 13.2.3 seems to have helped this a lot fyi.
PlusEVAnalytics,even if you unsubscribe from the email blasts youre still registered as an account.
PlusEVAnalytics,the first 10-15 minutes are pretty boring but stick with it it gets better
PlusEVAnalytics,see what youre missing by not betting on sports? we have so much fun.
PlusEVAnalytics,i should have gone with if youre obtuse its impossible to be right. #angles
PlusEVAnalytics,there are plenty of hysterical feminists who are unwilling and/or unable to measure it...
PlusEVAnalytics,maybe its just some jujutsu trollbait bullshit  to get the conversation started. 3d chess.
PlusEVAnalytics,although it would be hilarious if top asian referred to race instead of nationality...
PlusEVAnalytics,looking at individual states dimes odds are much closer to predictit than to 538.
PlusEVAnalytics,head start they gave themselves when they started selling picks was what +64 units?
PlusEVAnalytics,systematic deviations are not extreme outliers. theyre how every +ev originator finds his/her edge.
aluckyaday,betting does exist outside the us  trump just under 50 percent  to be re-elected.
aluckyaday,123.38 bfsp good if you got on when advised  not so good at 56/1

aluckyaday,if it ever happens. at the moment boris has not agreed to do it.

aluckyaday,not sure suggesting that the queen should refuse any further request is very practical.
aluckyaday,unless of course your motive for betting is dopamine. then sunday belongs to you!
aluckyaday,not sure smarkets would want you to know what hanson want to lay either
aluckyaday,any chance the banning of tramadol this year has anything to do with it?

mschwimer,if you listen to the interview you will understand the context of the quote.
mschwimer,still no explanation? im waiting. as always. very happy to make adjustments when warranted.
mschwimer,depends how you define flaw. i fully admit our service is not for everyone.
mschwimer,boom. will look into that. anything else? really trying to do this once haha.
mschwimer,response on what? sorry lots of tweets today. what can i help you with?
mschwimer,we only post plays with a minimum of a 4 percent  edge.  great question.
mschwimer,i did not mention that at all. you misheard. agreed on devers and bogarts
mschwimer,i understand now. thank you for the compliment and glad you like the show!
mschwimer,unreal game. i can't believe it. so happy for  #nofreelunch #bethehunter #omaha #1186 #champions
mschwimer,thanks but i dont need custom design... just custom fit... appreciate the help though
mschwimer,the only double doubles i know of is what amir johnson does every night
mschwimer,how about the temple owls.  just man handling syracuse in the garden right now
mschwimer,is he you are favorite cuz he was the only one u could beat?
mschwimer,i tried to get u to go with me and u big leagued me
mschwimer,can i take option c and say new episodes of the big bang theory
mschwimer,in person huge thumbs up... but i heard on tv it wasnt very good
mschwimer,now off to the casino... gonna be sayin buckets all over the craps table!
mschwimer,i agree... but i  daily fantasy sports  make the rules... i just follow them
mschwimer,1 year 4 months and 10 days for a hammy? is that a record?
RufusPeabody,where can we see your documented record of over 1000 totals youve recommended?
RufusPeabody,wed love to hear your feedback! did you add it to the form?
RufusPeabody,6 years is a tiny sample when youre betting 20 games per year!
RufusPeabody,aside from his draft pick why are you saying his upside is limited?
RufusPeabody,thats what simple bet is doing now? seems miles from where they started
RufusPeabody,if it shifts to the fair price there's no value on either side.
RufusPeabody,"will anyone in the nats clubhouse yell ""i'm so glad *they* got osuna?"""
RufusPeabody,if the separate info has no predictive value though then it doesn't follow.
RufusPeabody,great example of why data mining for trends is like reading tea leaves.
RufusPeabody,what a great open! always nice when all the hard work pays off.
RufusPeabody,but... the whole origin of kelly criterion formula is based on known probability.
RufusPeabody,disagree. those are basic publicly-available ranking systems based (i believe) on final scores.
RufusPeabody,would this change if the person was monetizing the picks in some way?
RufusPeabody,"my girlfriend: ""no cursing! what if our kids listen to your podcast someday"""
RufusPeabody,so you graded the side a loss and the total a no action?
RufusPeabody,ive talked to two people in my building who bought picks from him.
RufusPeabody,yeah they can get around it but the optics of it aren't great.
RufusPeabody,stay tuned for a tony romo odds update following the completion of r1.
RufusPeabody,completely agree but i  daily fantasy sports  think  that is  what they meant.
RufusPeabody,wait...what?? i want the story. the whole story. feud. reconciliation. all of it.
RufusPeabody,coronavirus very much under control. you cant test positive if you arent tested.
RufusPeabody,i like to think i bet for a living before it was cool
RufusPeabody,ive heard of people booking to san jose ca instead of costa rica
RufusPeabody,from experience i'm also not a fan of playoff games running over time...

RufusPeabody,no  final episode was recorded 3 weeks before the first one aired.
RufusPeabody,and that team will probably cover about 50 percent  of the time.
RufusPeabody,risking $1 at -143 odds would be a -15 percent  expected roi.
RufusPeabody,paul direct question: do you think that would fly in the us?
RufusPeabody,false. i was blocked by the sahrtrading guy after i blocked him

12Xpert,excel. i've described how to do it quickly here:
12Xpert,here's a little bit more on tipster survivorship bias.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  tos advise only with recreational books?
12Xpert,this based on pinny closing odds sample size 397935.
12Xpert,what is the data source and what time period?
12Xpert,this give an idea of how much less volatile.
12Xpert,is that with the margin removed from pinny's odds?
12Xpert,"midweek extra leagues data added: 
weekend fixtures coming shortly."
12Xpert,9.3 percent  probability assuming 30 percent  chance for each.
12Xpert,i think this might make a good ph.d. thesis.
