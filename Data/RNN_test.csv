12Xpert,say i bet 2.1 and it closes at 2.0 (a free throw er juice is removed). if the closing price is 'true' then my predicted roi is given by 2.1/2.0 = 1.05 or 105 percent  (5 percent  profit). if i make thousands of bets like this and i make a 5 percent  profit this implies the closing prices were 'true' (on average).

mschwimer,using an extreme example to show how bad that chart is. if i charged $1 for a pick. if it lost id give back $100. that is 100 percent  positive positive expected value for the sub. anyone with a brain would agree. my question is where is the line between positive and negative positive expected value on $ back plus guarantee?
mschwimer,very easy answer. they say no tout has a system that works. if they did then they would bet themselves.  simple answer. if you actually believe that you should be the #1 person to sign up. cost 3k if wrong but +10k if you r right. put  years old you are $ where  years old you are mouth is. we do

ClevTA,they've faced two of the top 3 and 3 of the top 8 in 3rd down conversion  percent  allowed in their l assit 3 gms. their avg yards to go on 3rd downs has been 9 yards.  that is  crazy bad. its a stat that typically regresses to norm so i wouldn't expect it to be this bad going forward
ClevTA,yes th against the spread accurate. but home favorites off the bye are 4-8-1 so n overtime as bad. its the home dogs off a bye which are horrific. niners are in the home fav category. also home favs won outright 8 of 13 gms. im a browns fan so only talking straight up here n overtime against the spread
ClevTA,to show u how little a sample the first 4 weeks of an nfl season can be l assit year thru 4 weeks the top 10 in overall dvoa included jax mia cin car was gb. none of those 6 made the playoffs. dal was 24th  made playoffs. in 2017 3 of the top 6 thru week 4 missed playoffs
PlusEVAnalytics,ps there is one upside to breakage. say theres such a heavy favorite that the payout should be $2.15. they are n overtime allowed to round down to $2 so they must round up to $2.20.this is called a minus pool. these can be + expected value as the track can end up paying out more than it takes in.
PlusEVAnalytics,"to start it seems that the diff in positive expected value between a unique lineup and one with 1 duplicate is 
1st prize - 1/2 (1st+2nd) + 2nd - 1/2 (2nd+3rd) + ... = 1/2 * first prize?
similarly difference in positive expected value between a unique lineup and one with 2 duplicates is 2/3 * 1st prize?is that correct?"
aluckyaday,maybe they  daily fantasy sports  see them as related if it is 2 different riders. if you select the same rider for each stage does it allow the bet? if it does n overtime then it is likely they have forg overtime to mark the 2 events as related and you risk them n overtime paying out if you win

EdMillerPoker,cave against the spread are all sports data are short samples so always take data with that in mind and the sports are always changing so there may have been a rule change or league strategy change or whatever that means it will land on 1 2 or 3 less o free throw en going forward than in the past
LeeSharpeNFL,i think we're pretty close to this with  expected points added . and probably some day somebody will make something better than  expected points added  with ngs data or the like. and we'll move on from  expected points added  to that just as we moved on from any/a (which was fantastic at time of creation!) to  expected points added .
AndyMSFW,"i skipped out on playing 18 hole match-ups for round 1 because i thought ""i  daily fantasy sports  have any info about how they are performing here yet and i'd just end up using all 8 of my 72 hole match-ups""  n overtime sure if  that is  a long term good idea but i missed out on some cash today..."
LockyLockerson,"in  college football  i didn't bet either game l assit night but really wish i'd followed the steam on georgia southern (once the weather was what it was).  i am n overtime playing navy-uconn.

i will have my  college football  bets as usual tonight before i go to bed!  enjoy  years old you are friday i'll be watching the bc!"
LockyLockerson,i honestly want to try to explain this in a way th against the spread n overtime adversarial and so it makes sense.  if  years old you are goal is to bet against harbaugh as a dog no matter what you are ignoring what the number is entirely.  so michigan is +40 still a bet? +66? +100? hes a dog.
DannyParkins,i used to play so much more and now hardly ever get to and i miss it a ton. when you play as much as i did from 06-09 online and at turning stone which is an 18+ casino 45 minutes from syracuse youve been on the right and wrong end of 1-outers enough to n overtime remember just one.
DannyParkins,i listened to an interview with  and he made a good point: say tweet with link goes viral then you edit the link to a harmful page a free throw er the fact  now  years old you are viral tweet has different message/offensive content etc. they're testing a quick edit o point ion if u notice mistake f assit enough

ToddFuhrman,"i get that part but i've always been of the mindset (logistically speaking well aware of the hurdles) why n overtime build a  college football  challenge schedule that rotates ly seeds match-up

year 1: sec vs big ten acc vs pac 12 big 12 vs aac
year 2: sec vs acc pac 12 vs big 12 aac vs big ten"
TheCousinSal,as someone who has a l overtime riding on nova (i bet no big 10 team to win ncaa and a 1 or 2 seed will win ncaa) it would be wise to take michigan +450 now...right?  right? n overtime doing it.  so in less than an ho you are youll all enjoy a good laugh at my expense. #ncaachampionship
12Xpert,well i suspect you're going to hurl more insults at me for this. i came up with a little model to vary expected win  percent  for each bet. so say the long term expected figure is 57 percent . i've been assuming every bet is 57 percent . but now what happens if we vary this as you suggest because...
12Xpert,as for the economic pain of wto rules obviously hard brexit would hurt (for n years n unknown). but my point is that you  daily fantasy sports  have to be in the eu to get rid of tariffs. the uk can have no tariffs with all countries it trades with if it wants. it doesn't need the eu for that.
12Xpert,i agree on reflection i thought it was too which is why i deleted it. however i still think all this moaning about a few selecting a new prime minister is at bit over the top. boris is a hypocrite for complaining about it in 2007 as are labo you are now. this is how o you are system works
mschwimer,we agree. twitter words are meaningless. all about the words on o you are website and the ts and cs. with current ts and cs you cant find a single thing that we could use to get out of o you are guarantee. and that is a fact. if you can please let me know and we will fix it!
mschwimer,we release o you are picks and instantly send an email to o you are subscribers. o you are picks include the line and book we g overtime the line from. we grade off the picks when we send them out. imo you should just pick a system and stick with it. just be consistent or the record is unreliable.
RufusPeabody,another big question is at #1. a majority of o you are models in the ensemble give lsu a very slight edge over ohio state but the ones that  daily fantasy sports  make ohio state a very clear #1. ohio state doesn't have the same marquee wins as lsu but has blown everyone out. could go either way here
RufusPeabody,my concern with the policy is that it has a predatory effect. im n overtime saying th against the spread the intention but my opinion is that is the effect. people are forced in some cases to bet more just to get their money back. this does n overtime sit well with me. its a common offshore book ploy.
RufusPeabody,"we're betting on a coin flip. i offer two o point ions:

(a) flip a coin. if  it is  heads you win. if  it is  tails you lose.

or

(b) flip a coin. if  it is  heads you win. if  it is  tails you flip twice more. if both come up heads you win. if n overtime you lose."

capjack2000,"yes  that is  a common gotcha. another ploy is to advertise a redeposit bonus but the bonus amount must be   years old you are avg wager. 

if you've been limited  years old you are avg wager is very small so  years old you are offered bonus becomes very small. 

haven't seen stuff like that in legal markets yet though."
dinkinc,you say the alphabet as it relates to the horses by post position and bet the one where the letter corresponds with the first later of the horses name.. so if the 5 horse's name starts with an e that would be  years old you are win bet...you can go on to find a second horse for an exacta
robpizzola,"betting markets had columbus in 4 at 2.1 percent . i was higher on columbus and had them winning in 4 at 3.0 percent .

anyone who calls this one of the biggest upsets of all-time is out to lunch."
RASPicks,if pros were betting on the picks there would be evidence in the line history. even one max bet at pinn or cris from a pro could be seen in the line history. it isn't just that the picks  daily fantasy sports  beat the close which is bad enough. pros/market  daily fantasy sports  care about these picks at all.
ClevTA,th against the spread exactly why i said n overtime saying its right or wrong. those factors matter to gms. the second they admit the mistake and pull the plug then their jobs are in jeopardy. so its n overtime the same decision making between deciding if a college qb rises up the dra free throw  board or not
ClevTA,well that would mean u are keeping an extra wr off the field so less downfield thre against the spread but without a good 2nd te and the fact that hunt is a great receiver its n overtime a weakness. n overtime many teams have two rbs who can run and equally run routes so its a nice advantage
ClevTA,again u dont actually read my tweets. name the l assit pass rusher on a title contender with anywhere near 15+ sacks? he has 13 with 4 gms le free throw  with rutgers and maryland who are 84th and 95th in sack percent  allowed. hes going to be in 17-20 range  suh was in ny with only 12 sacks

ClevTA,i dont care if nobody agrees. this is an absolute must win for the browns. u cant be 0-1 heading into ny on  monday night football  then home to the rams on the road in balt and on the road on a cross country trip to sf on  monday night football . 1-0 affords u so much more cushion

spanky,im n overtime a character that entertains audiences. i g overtime 4 kids. i bet sports professionally to earn n overtime have my name in lights.  no one in the general public knew who i was till l assit june.  only the upper echelon of the business knew me.  part of me wishes i ke point  it that way.
PlusEVAnalytics,thanks! i actually had two models - one to predict the win probability relative to the live odds the other to predict the final odds relative to the live odds. the second was needed because the odds would o free throw en move against us a free throw er we bet as other syndicates g overtime their money in.
PlusEVAnalytics,you should have 24 single game win probs. first multiply all 24 together call that a. then take 1 minus each one and multiply it by the other 23 call that b - so you have one a and 24 bs. add all 25 of them together and th against the spread the prob of under 1.5 total losses.

aluckyaday,i know just in the uk they tend to limit you across the board trying to think of a reason why rather than by individual sports. maybe just how the so free throw ware was originally written and they have n overtime changed it silly to limit a + expected value basketball guy betting on the superbowl coin toss!
aluckyaday,yep. we have been through it. 20 years ago restrictions were rare. now almost all uk books have ado point ed it. at first it annoyed me. but now i understood why they need to do it. now it irritates me more when others  daily fantasy sports . probably should n overtime go on about it so much though....
aluckyaday,yes but only if 25/1 was the true odds of him being mos. i believe the true odds should have been a l overtime higher because he played for salford who were n overtime expected to do well. that is why my for 28/1 for the double is too low. he probably should have been more like (guess) 100/1!
aluckyaday,the referendum was advisory. we looked at  years old you are advise and decided n overtime to take it because it is n overtime in the best interests of the country. if you are n overtime happy with that then you do n overtime have to re-elect us to represent you that is a true representative democracy in action.

nonrandomalpha,you going to a game and cheering for the team also accomplishes nothing. so should you n overtime do it? ofc th against the spread silly. he wants to burn the jersey to express frustration which helps release pent up tensions. th against the spread the purpose th against the spread the personal accomplishment for him. let him be
nonrandomalpha,im n overtime a huge fan of nfl probability charts; they do n overtime represent reality. if these probability odds were pricing o point ions black swan events apparently happen on a regular basis - which in fact is n overtime the case. too many games approach 95-99 percent  but do n overtime win 95-99 percent  of the time.
LeeSharpeNFL,"how much of that is advantages of the bye (having to win one less game rest) vs. the fact that teams with a bye tend to be better teams?

i give no as 72 percent  to defeat min. if that happens i have them as a favorite in gb as well. despite the rest/hfa no is the better team."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this year was.... n overtime a good year for us. bittersweet especially a free throw er three top 200 finishes in a contest that pays out to the top 100. variance is real but we could have done better.

DannyParkins,the dra free throw  is before the all star break and a free throw er the dra free throw  he doesnt have a pick attached. i dont know if/when hell sign but one big fa reliever doesnt solve the problems with a pen th against the spread given up 17 runs in 17 innings. again what dont i understand?

PikachuBets,still getting super wooshed my friend. no doubt  best of luck had nyy -307  that is  n overtime a dispute. nobody else ever carried that line bc it was an opener. n overtime wa. wa opened -340 is n overtime -360. movement was n overtime -307 to -360. you're n overtime getting what the diff is b/w the two.
adamchernoff,are all things i think about in anticipation of the lookahead number next tuesday and the opening number a week later the morning of nov 12th. off a neutral result on  monday night football  we would easily see a -14.5 opener for sf just like we could see a -16.5 off a big  monday night football  victory. but the...
adamchernoff,n overtime sure i agree with that. there was a ton of push in the market at -3 that was n overtime met with resistance until -4. would take an enormous swing of opinion within the market to get this down to -2.5. n overtime any signs of that across the market right now as its leaning to -3.5.
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  know if i would be running to bet on them but i certainly would n overtime be running to bet against them. arguably the deepest team in the nfl with a coach pushing a philosophy change on offence which is now over looked. a l overtime of dust to settle here yet before making decisions.
ToddFuhrman,so why wouldn't you run the risk of going for 2 miss you're still up 1.  next possession you score a  touchdown  and can go for 2 again to take it from 7 to 9; being up 3 means more than worrying about the subsequent score to be up 9 when the 9 would still be on the table

mschwimer,th against the spread the best part about full transparency. no angle to find. if you believe in us. sign up and play o you are recs. if n overtime sign up and dont play them. only people that should n overtime sign up are people that believe in us but can only play $20 per game or so.
mschwimer,we also line shop because that is what o you are subscribers want. we started by using only 1 book but the overwhelming feedback was o you are subscribers wanted to know where the best line was so that is what we do now.  hope to have 2 record tabs. one for best line and one using 1 book.
RufusPeabody,congr against the spread on the good week! the issue though is that most 10-wk subs pulled the plug somewhere in the first 1000 plays given the results and mediocre clv. so you have a situation where theyre rooting against you so they get 10k and are in less of a hole. timing n overtime great for them
RufusPeabody,"interesting how many different definitions of closing line value there are. i view it as the difference in expected roi between the line i g overtime and the closing line from ""market"" book (incl vig). i  daily fantasy sports  think there's a right or wrong way to do it; it all depends on what you're trying to measure"
SportsCheetah,counting 1st  touchdown  props at 35/1 the same as any other play is also great if it were to actually hit but i dont know many bettors regularly betting 35/1 1st  touchdown  prop shots for as much as their other edges. it would be a very small flyer. at le assit hes putting effort in to track tho
SportsCheetah,exactly right... he always had the tools he was the #1 recruit in the country out of hs but in practice they'd give him every opportunity to earn the sp overtime and he couldn't make progression reads a free throw er the first o point ion before just trying to run with the ball  which is obviously a

capjack2000,"i disagree. a public that loses at a 9 percent  rate is an unsustainable product. like  daily fantasy sports  became.

aluckyaday,but the punter acce point ed 25/1 as the odds for the mos so the double would have to be worked out on that. also i'm guessing at the price of the one given the other there was no published price. yes they could guess like me but really the only fairish way is to pay 2 singles.

Gingfacekillah,scoring distribution in nfl is clumped together in bands with some margins of victory much more likely to occ you are than others (3 7 etc.) this could be a factor. if the closing line is -10 and its off its more likely to be off by a l overtime (-7 -14 -17) rather than a little (-11).

kc: 54.5 percent  * 1.075 = .5886 
den: 45.5 percent  * 1.02 = .4641

kc: 1 / .5886 = 1.69 (-140)

mschwimer,closing line value is extremely over rated. i know its what everyone in the industry uses but i firmly disagree. if the sports betting market were a fair market i would agree. but its n overtime even close to a fair market because books dont take big action anymore. we use o you are model edge  percent .
RufusPeabody,if my math is right a free throw er the 10 percent  fee to the seller this means the seller is essentially hedging at a price of +138.4. yikes! only way this makes sense for the seller is if they are risk averse and  daily fantasy sports  have access to a book (or enough $$ to hedge).
SportsCheetah,the l assit player to score at le assit 58 in a loss was... devin booker l assit year against the jazz (59). harden is 1 of 5 players in nba history though to lose multiple games when scoring at le assit 55 points. (booker mj and bernard king all have 2 such games wilt has 21).
SportsCheetah,orl o41.5 -110 - i project the magic to win 43.7 games and bet them -140 to make the playoffs (prefer it to rsw over). same team that won 42 (43 pythag) a year ago but now in year two of mo bamba potential fultz upside and added aminu? orlando is super solid in a bad east.
SportsCheetah,putting more pressure on  who is on a 13-0  college football  run on daily wager (tune in friday for this weekend's stuff). i'm n overtime sure how many he'll fire on but the most i've ever done is 16. hopefully can push him to make it at le assit 4 selections and take a shot. gl gl

dinkinc,th against the spread all i have seen on twitter.  if kendrick grounded into a 1-2-3 double play the n against the spread fans would have screamed for a pinch hitter .cubs manager fired for the same reason roberts will get fired. seems everyone wants him and he missed the playoffs.. i hope roberts gets a gig
dinkinc,they wanted may to be the answer. i would have used kershaw 100 percent  before anyone else. hall of famer who has a history of pitching bad in october or 4 choices who have sucked most of the year. kelly in the 9th was surprising but he was so good he g overtime the tenth. hate redboarding
dinkinc,six years ago some mma fighter i never heard of sat beside me at an   show.. i might have said ten words to her but i was impressed by her enthusiasm for what she was watching..when she came back i asked her if she would like to be on a radio show i was doing .. 1/3

RASPicks,never understood that theory. even at o you are peak volume ras total plays accounted for a fraction of the big line moves on a given  college basketball  week. kenpom had a much larger influence on the evolution of the market. anyhow who says  it is  ruined? we even g overtime totals on extras l assit season!
ProfessorShine,success rate in nfl is shade under 50 percent  and just above 90 percent  pat.  college football  is lower rate of 2 point  success (osu nor clemson attem point ed a 2  point  conversion all year).  but in this scenario its still worth it to get up 3 points  which is an important lead in 4th quarter.
ClevTA,theyve played two straight games and 3 of the l assit 4 in high winds and rain. i wouldnt put a ton of stock in those offensive performances. 20 at baltimore which is the 2nd best d in the nfl in the l assit month 33 v the 5th best d in the nfl at the jets

aluckyaday,it will be interesting to see how widely available gambling and alcohol sit together in the us. that is one thing the european books have n overtime been able to get p assit the legislators in the uk. unlike the us there has been a tradition of keeping gambling and alcohol well s expected points added rated.
aluckyaday,if it were starting from scratch it would have a hell of a job getting off the ground  that is  for sure. but it is part of british culture and employs a l overtime of people. there are quite a few incentives to keep it going even though in its current form its n overtime really viable.
aluckyaday,so i guess the wisdom of the crowd is scalping. the issue for the book is it becomes much easier to do online. all you have to do is react quicker to pinney line movements than the books. 2 solutions tie  years old you are lines to pinney and try and move quicker than the automated scalpers..
aluckyaday,a few weeks ago there was a discussion about estimated bank size needed to follow  years old you are selections and you refused to answer the question. so even if we wanted to use  years old you are method to calculated expected roi we can't! i have no idea how much i need bring to the table
aluckyaday,how much do uk so free throw s restrict if you only bet 1x2? all my restrictions have been because of racing bets football is only ever recreational for me. i guess the so free throw s here do n overtime have access to the hugh team in red asian recreational bets to offset any sharp liabilities.

EdMillerPoker,re the article? i mean  it is  n overtime shakespeare but the point that you're n overtime gaining any edge by waiting for some particular event to happen in the game before betting is a good one. in general in-play markets are so free throw  bc of widespread line errors but if you can't sp overtime those...
GolcondaFund,3 - unlike the other 6-0 plays this one has some fundamental logic as to why everyone is on browns - and  that is  jet's injuries. the other games had zero fundamental logic why everyone was so high on team x as if team y did n overtime exist in the ever so ignored sports betting equation
nonrandomalpha,unintended but will happily take the middle for a nice 2 percent  return. n overtime proud of this one tho a bit mismanaged. michigan was n overtime the better team. g overtime lucky at +3 when army was on verge of doing up 17-7 or 21-7. michigan would n overtime have recovered from that. int saved us.
nonrandomalpha,"are you following o you are multi-sport total return fund?

 it is  early but you can see o you are performance has been stellar. nonetheless  it is  n overtime just performance that is important but the amount of risk being taken by the manager.

nonrandomalpha,jax had 50+ sacks in 17 + then barely 30 in 18. going into 18 many believed sacksonville would be just as if n overtime more potent than it was in 17 and compete for a super bowl. regression is mean bitch but in a sport that is as random as football it is a real phenomenon.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i thought 5th year o point ion was fully guaranteed once exercised but apparently  it is  guaranteed for injury only until next league year starts.

 that is  n overtime too bad."
LeeSharpeNFL,"trubisky and mariota as likely o point ions for bears 2020 starter is.... uninspiring to say the le assit but the bears  daily fantasy sports  have great o point ions.

would prefer a foles trade over either i think.

but any of these o point ions are at best a bridge n overtime the long term answer."
LeeSharpeNFL,"my priorities for bears for this offseason:

- fire ryan pace. nick caserio will be available and he may n overtime want go to hou a free throw er bill o'brien traded away two 1st round picks.
- trade a 2nd round pick for an actual serviceable quarterback
- stop trading up/dra free throw ing rbs early."
AndyMSFW,since i spent the time screwing around with 3-ball odds today i figured i might as well add to my liability for pebble beach.  i bet these small as i'm still working things out on this  i used a nice sh overtime of the course as to n overtime waste a picture of paulina for next week.
LockyLockerson,also finally had free time to blow the dust off some nfl rsw stuff.  here's a chart you may or may n overtime find interesting. since 2010 here's how many nfl teams have finished with each number of wins (le free throw  half) and how o free throw en the win-total is set in those ranges (right)
DannyParkins,i  daily fantasy sports  take a l overtime of calls on the score ever. the network enjoys calls. also  it is  a solo show so calls/other voices are more necessary whereas on the score i have mac/tanne/shep. i'm n overtime a big yell at the caller i enjoy conversational. hope that answered  years old you are question.
DannyParkins,read my tweets. i have a problem with similar calls in other sports. also that call isnt reviewable the first 38 minutes of the game so it would be tech ball and no one would complain and then l assit 2 minutes its called the complete opposite on slow mo review and th against the spread right?
Gingfacekillah,"det v ind:

if jackson is dnp from sore back his  points  prop is void if he does play with a hurt back u15.5 has some value.

tony snell should be able to cover o6.5  points  with increased minutes and usage this year. o1.5 3pm is enticing as well since wing 3's will be his main role."
Gingfacekillah,the worst bets most bettors will ever make are right a free throw er big wins and big losses for this exact reason. if you can watch the games in a detached way to glean additional information that informs  years old you are process great. if n overtime better to remain centered by n overtime doing so.
logan_matthews9,"sorry im probably getting back to you too late. but ive g overtime bubba 14th this week so just slightly below market. think theyll be better fits for him

hovland is just a good golfer so for a 1 and done i dont think you need to use him now. with a $ cap hes probably undervalued"
logan_matthews9,"took some rory at 9 (mybookie) and day at 51.5 (bookmaker). rory is as low as 6 day as low as 36. put rory at about 15 percent  to win significantly ahead of the next closest (6.5 percent  for rahm). n overtime really close on anyone else

only person im really fading vs market is tiger. yikes"
logan_matthews9,hes 29 n overtime 37. and again you are putting the usmnt on some pedestal in  years old you are head when we are coming off a lost generation. and he was also the striker when the us had arguably its greatest win ever - in 09 against spain. so all of those points are bad takes
logan_matthews9,a question for any of the fellow gamblers out there -  let us  say you get good value on a line early. if like a third of the way through the game the live line has shi free throw ed even further to where you can get the other side for guaranteed profit do you take it?
logan_matthews9,gb is a tactical coach whereas jurgen was a development/structure guy. you can be upset about the result l assit night or n overtime like his tactics but to compare the 2 is ridiculous. th against the spread n overtime even defending gb - 6 months in jk had completely revamped the coaching structure in the us

adamchernoff,but in the end i was sitting in a much shitter and expensive failed attem point  to replicate the business model that works so well in the bahamas. the silver lining for folks in the area is that betting is legal and people can wager real money and get paid (more o free throw en) than before.
adamchernoff,ha first ever nfl game believe it or not! takes a l overtime to get me out during the season but three of us that grew up together are going next weekend. two of us jets fans the other a giants fan. should be fun to catch the rare regular season matchup and eat around the city.
adamchernoff,"being anchored to bets by looking at prices and saying something like ""well if this team is -3 for the game how can they be -2.5 for the 1st half!?"" or ""how can this team be -3.5 for the game but only -155 on the money line!?""

hope this was n overtime too much of a ramble..."
adamchernoff,"perfect example now of why an entry point into an in-play nfl market should always be on defence.

hou went from +550 to +230 without a point being scored. 5 point middle or 100 percent  return on  moneyline stake.

if ind were to score its a buy out for -20 percent  of stake. low risk high reward."

12Xpert,fair enough. when you have a 1 in a gazillion record that can be verified then come back to me assuming you want me an others to know  it is  possible. in the meantime i'd suggest you keep the fact that you have such a skill set to yourself so you  daily fantasy sports  lose that advantage.

dinkinc,it really depends on how much business you have ...if you have as many customers as  has outs you will always find one who will bet the other side.. then  it is  up to you to evealuate the two players to see if you should move the line back down.. also be aware of the market

aluckyaday,they are n overtime scared. they are running a business plan that maximises their profits. it is their choice. if you can beard back in then go for it. it is all part of the game. but ultimately the so free throw  book model will maximise their profits. it is modern bookmaking it is the future!
aluckyaday,so what is  years old you are solution. keep the whole of the uk in the customs union until a free trade deal is agreed? n overtime sure a free trade deal would actually negate the need for a border anyway. there are still physical checks between some eu countries never mind ones outside the union!
aluckyaday,discussing with  years old you are mates how close you were to winning when the number of interce point ions in the second half fell short by one when you g overtime the total punts total qb passing yards and time of the first penalty correct has more utility for a $20 recreational punter than winning!
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  think that is true. if you listen to marco taking to the modeling community rather than the bookmaking community the models are the business. the betting data and who is betting goes in to s expected points added rate models. this is combined with the sports model to create a market price.
aluckyaday,actually the maths is reasonably simple. to use the same amount of energy in  years old you are 400m race carrying the iphone you would need to run 0.18 percent  slower. so if you ran to 400m in 60sec it would take 60.168 seconds. you would therefore be 1.12 meters behind and lose to the clone
EdMillerPoker,"bottom line is i think if you want to bet in-play blind scalping is no good and you need to have a pretty strong idea which is the ""good"" side.

DannyParkins,"i agree with you about konerko. hall of very good and a sox legend. though the column wouldve been more efficient if you just said because its my ball overtime and i said so and signed  years old you are name.

im sure a big10 team or nd will beat clemson in the 2020s once. maybe."
DannyParkins,people are the worst versions of themselves in airports when travel issues come up. pil overtime announced plane was broke and they couldnt fix it. no extra planes in bahamas so this is gonna turn into a 8 ho you are delay and people are fuming. im just glad we didnt get on a broken plane.
DannyParkins,dude mahomes was mvp 1st year starting. he had one of the 3 best statistical seasons ever. against colts his top 2 wr  the le free throw  side of his line were out  he g overtime hurt during the game. he shattered kurt warners record for production thru first 20 games. what are u talking about?
DannyParkins,"in 2017 kareem hunt was a 3rd round rookie with matt nagy as his offensive coordinator and he had 272 carries for a league leading 1327 yards with 8  touchdown s. he also caught 53 balls for 455 yards and 3  touchdown s.

what will 3rd round rookie david montgomery do with nagy as his coach?"
DannyParkins,again you fail to show specifics. ive given you ample opportunity to do so and you name call. i stand by what i said on the show and on here. i showed you my actual work with dv which you ignore. im sure you hate dv more than everyone. going into dinner have a good one.
logan_matthews9,i dont see any excuses up there. the us vastly outplayed mexico over the first 90 - and especially the opening hour. i think the one team has a future comment is too far but if you watched this match and think the mexican side is more talented im n overtime sure what to tell you
logan_matthews9,and its n overtime just getting better lines its avoiding bad ones. one that comes to mind is the memphis/houston game. i g overtime it at under 205 when it first posted. the next morning you took it over 202 (i think). maybe if you had the choice at 205 you wouldnt have taken that bet?
PikachuBets,what am i supposed to be silenced by again? took this horse over 10 days to honor o you are bet to donate to charities now he clamors for others to donate. or are we supposed to be impressed by 870 in winnings? why dont you ask for his baseball results this year lol 70 units
PikachuBets,also that is a tweet from april and youre ripping me for it now? get a fucking life. stop being obsessed with me. you are a meathead who is p assit his prime and cant face the music. have fun tweeting to absolutely nobody and getting almost zero responses on  years old you are tweets lmao
PikachuBets,"who gives a fucking shit about any of 538's sports projections? c'mon bro you did st against the spread at harvard you know better than to peddle this non-predictive pile of public knowledge dogshit as noteworthy in any way

or maybe you  daily fantasy sports . you do work for dk a free throw er all.."
PikachuBets,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand welcome to exhibit a re: the major problem with claiming  best of luck openers. it makes you think the market moved from -307 to -360. no.  best of luck opener was -307 everyone else opened -340/-345. the market didn't move bc he bet. market is just better than  best of luck so free throw  open.
adamchernoff,it was my first time to go on a national show and i was thankful for that. a pretty cool opportunity for a nobody like me. i did my best to present the games in the way i do. hopefully it gave the listeners an opportunity to think about games and betting in a different way.
adamchernoff,how you get there is quite a long journey but the quickest way to n overtime get there is believing there is always a secret side to every game you can blindly follow to make you money because bookmakers always win. it is foolish and it is lazy. but  daily fantasy sports  confuse this with tracking...
adamchernoff,n overtime sure if i am in much better of a situation. my book headers light up at the top of the column but it doesn't say which game or price moves screen stays static. going on 24 hours now. a l overtime of right clicking and line history grabbing for instance 107/108 over just now.

adamchernoff,"worst week of the season for readers of my  and i. 

all three bets come up on the wrong side and give back 3.41x on the day. add in the 1.28x loss l assit week and it is the worst run of the nfl season. 

moving on. focus shi free throw s to nfl week 12."
Ccon8181,saw this from a mile away. everyone blaming cp3 and saying hes too old. give me the old dude the gives it 100 percent  along with eric gordon and pj tucker. look back to critical playoff games p assit 3 seasons. times when harden barley made it into the front court on o. zero effort imo
ToddFuhrman,"oh i'd love there to be decent human beings...but we know  that is  n overtime o free throw en the case anywhere in big time athletics when w's and l's are on the line

even at the fcs level i'm sure you were around yalies that would have sold their soul to guarantee wins over harvard"
ToddFuhrman,i think th against the spread my major takeaway.. is that this is focused on the painting of a house (to use an analogy) rather than seeking to r expected points added ir a foundation. dialogue and open discussion is always good but the key is prioritizing the issues. appreciate the back and forth my friend
ToddFuhrman,he knew what he was dealing with when he headed to la...that was his choice and if you're n overtime going to take to being a leader on a team with kids then nobody is going to have sympathy for the bed you've made for yourself.  his on court is fine his attitude now a mess
12Xpert,...bettors are n overtime coins. so i used a normally distributed random number generator to vary 57 percent  using a standard deviation of 6 percent  and counted the number of winners in 34 bets repeated 10000 via a monte carlo. average minimum expected win  percent  for a bet in 34 bets was about 44 percent ...
12Xpert,i can check although could be a little tricky since i  daily fantasy sports  have a measure of what a 'big' team is. do you have one? obviously i would expect this sort of data mining to be completely meaningless and on the off chance it returns a profit will be because of small sample size.
12Xpert,you may be the only person in this thread up to now who has contributed nothing jez. my threads are to facilitate debate about things which are to a significant extent unknown and uncertain. i  daily fantasy sports  see  years old you are name in the forbes rich list so presumably you're n overtime sure either.
12Xpert,actually youre right the bet would be + expected value for me and would therefore be rational but the point about refusing to pay someone who would claim proof on the back of a 34 percent  chance of it happening by luck still stands. he needs to explain more why he thinks his systems are +ev
12Xpert,really  daily fantasy sports  know  it is  n overtime something i've spend a l overtime of time on. i think most people who use poisson say  it is  a bit crude because one team scoring a goal is n overtime independent of the other team. there are better statisticians than me who can help you here.

JambosPicks,we dont believe this will continue. if you do believe it will continue you are welcome to buy o you are 4 week package and n overtime play any of o you are picks. if you are right and we cant beat the market you get 2k (including fee). if you are wrong you lose $900.
mschwimer,question. i just saw the plays you put out today and you have seattle -108. i see them at much higher prices everywhere. what book do you use for  years old you are lines? also do you email subscribers when the picks are available? i never g overtime an email but i just registered this morning.
mschwimer,this is amazing.  and i have each won 6 consecutive best bets. the likelihood of us picking 12 straight winners in a sample of 12 games assuming we have a 50/50 chance at each pick is roughly 1 in 5000. even if we had a 60 percent  edge on each pick it is 1 in 500.
RufusPeabody,giving out picks is the thing i le assit like to do in this space. i hate the tout space (including the free tout space). it started as a way to show that o you are rating system actually had value but now  it is  become a chore and one i  daily fantasy sports  like.
RufusPeabody,tried to fund  (while also funding resorts  dk) with cash at resorts. but i hadn't been prom point ed to enter my ssn when i signed up on the app so i couldn't fund it. (there was no cell rece point ion at the cage  i didn't have the time to leave and come back)
RufusPeabody,i've gotten shit for making absolute statements before. n overtime every tout goes about it this way. i much more respect a tout that has been losing but doesn't falsify their record. there are one or two that have won long-term but you're n overtime going to get me to shill for a tout ever.
RufusPeabody,i've had 0-12 streaks yet that does n overtime lead me to the conclusion that i'm a losing bettor. but picking at 45 percent  or worse over 1000 games is 3.5 times more unlikely than going 0-12 for a 50 percent  bettor. and anyone who's been betting professionally for awhile knows that 0-12 can happen
capjack2000,"wait. is  going to be supplying lines for  to supply to sportsbooks for people to bet into?

i realize metric operates in shady markets in far away lands but we need to get them in the us a free throw er this news. 

fish are in the barrel folks bring  years old you are guns."
capjack2000,"i'm assuming you mean states which do n overtime allow the deduction of gambling losses against wins (there are 7 of them so i'm confused which 6). in that case you should be filing a schedule c as a professional. 

even if you're n overtime we're talking state income tax rates of 3-6 percent ."
capjack2000,"they have sixers +5.5 but you have to lay $25 to win $10. is that a good compromise? well you'd have to be a fairly sharp bettor to know the value of each point between. 

why n overtime just offer sixers -2 like the rest of the world?

...and foxbet is supposedly a ""fun sportsbook."""
capjack2000,"no wagering on injuries or penalties.

tn books will be permitted to ""lay off"" wagers to other tn books (none will probably ever do so). 

no word on protection of players rights to make wagers.

all in all n overtime a bad first dra free throw . tn might need to relax a little though."
capjack2000,"their cut should be based on a  percent  of ggr. nothing in that ledger points to a  percent  of ggr since the game vendor charges are $370k. maybe they rolled in startup costs but i doubt that is $200k at most. 

subsequent months may allow us to see the sbtech  percent . they'll hate that."
capjack2000,"that time is already here. there are 11 physical sportsbooks; 6 use the same lines.  there are 6 online sportsbooks; 4 use the same lines. 5 sets of lines in pa 2 aren't online. 

pa's fees have created a barrier to entry that is restricting  years old you are ability to find the best price."
capjack2000,"knowledge and information is everywhere. you are limited only by time and how much you can process. you should always be seeking out more signal  less noise to maximize  years old you are efficiency. 

can you pick up nuggets from those podcasts? yes.
but are they the best use of  years old you are time?"
capjack2000,"i believe kambi bonuses are use once. you get the winnings only.  it is  been a year since i played bonuses at kambi sites so  it is  possible they've changed but that screensh overtime looked familiar. 

you're right if they add the bonus to  years old you are cash from the start its different strategy."
capjack2000,"a key snippet in that egr story i linked earlier. kip levin (coo fanduel) stating that their d expected points added rture from the european model is deliberate. 

my quote that followed was made before i was aware of that. however i think  it is  also a key component to the success of that approach."
capjack2000,"it looks like . has restricted me to $300 sides and $100 totals now. this weekend i beat them for $500 on an aaf bet. their response a free throw er losing a bet on an inefficient sport is to cut my limits on efficient markets like nba and nfl. 

this is bad bookmaking folks."
dinkinc,offshores  daily fantasy sports  pay enough unless you are running the show... business kind of sucks unless you are established or a very talented player. maybe someone on the list will give you the guidence to win...i'm n overtime much more than a break even player and too old to work as hard as tunes
dinkinc,i won $1100 yesterday and feel like i took two years off of my life... i have to eliminate something and i think  it is  g overtime to be college football...too hard to disern my advantages in a twelve game season..too hard to monitor my open bets.. too hard to get down at peak numbers
suuma810,"since week 10 the #chiefs defense ranks 32nd in third down conversion rate against the pass (49 percent ) 30th on 3rd  5+ (40 percent ). 

on the season they rank 32nd in rush dvoa: 31st on 1st down 28th on 2nd  32nd on 3rd/4th. how are they gonna get the #colts off the field?"
ClevTA,i think they have a bottom quartile defense. their coaching philosophy on o is negative expected value and by n overtime letting russ loose they get down early too o free throw en and hes forced to make these miracle comebacks. better off coaching  i would look at them in a better lense i think
ClevTA,vikings use 3 wr sets the le assit amount in the nfl by a wide margin  instead use 1-2 and 2-1 close to 2/3rds of all their plays. unfortunately while the saints are essentially league average on d defending 3 wrs they rank 2nd and 1st on d against 1-2 and 2-1. does  minutes adjust?
ClevTA,isnt it most likely already incorporated into this line? i think most models would agree ne isn't -3.5/4 in philly right now but the extra 1+  point  premium is most likely bc the p against the spread have outperformed in this situation in the past? then its up to the bettor to determine the extent?
ClevTA,tbh the most realistic chaos would be osu loses to michigan but then wins big10 title gm. clemson loses in acc title gm. bama wins out. georgia loses to lsu in sec title gm. minnesota only 1 l is to osu in title gm. 1 of utah or oregon wins out and baylor goes undefeated
ClevTA,n overtime surprising but the browns now rank dead l assit in success rate from inside the 5 a free throw er yesterday. somehow browns are 1/16 in success rate from inside the 5 on 2nd-4th downs. 6/11 on first downs. the browns have zero runs from shotgun inside the 5. something has to change
ClevTA,"go away  years old you are argument is ridiculous and u keep standing behind this theory that any qb who is a backup for 1  year behind brees automatically means u will be good. huh? and outside of thomas what are these ""weapons"" the saints have? no real #2 wr cook  kamara have missed gms"
spanky,"question for nfl rules guys...

about 15 years ago or so an nfl game ended with a touchdown. i dont remember the teams i just think the team down 3  scored and went up 3. the refs made the players come back onto the field to kick the pat. 

when did this stop being enforced?"
spanky,"for me this bottom down approach is a recipe for disaster.  youre n overtime smarter than the market. respect it.

if you wanna make money betting  years old you are time is better spent watching lines move and picking off slow outs than reading fantasy sites on why team a is better than team b."
spanky,ha i do like magic.  my case was a state case out of ny. feds were only involved in the civil forfeiture. i took a felony and forfeited a bunch of money. i plead guilty to booking bets that i placed if that makes any sense.  i sometimes still regret n overtime going to trial.
spanky,great question. a line would auto move a free throw er player q bet say from -5 to -5-120.  the bookmaker would be the one to set the 10 cent move based on player qs profile. the bookmaker can then manually decide to go to -5.5  -5.5-115 or -6.  while hes deciding he is protected.
spanky,dont even know who you are but my betting partnerships run deep around the globe. to  years old you are comment i unfortunately can n overtime influence the outcome of a game. all i can do is try and beat the closing line (which you admit i do). its a marathon n overtime a sprint.
spanky,"twitter is filled with guys pretending to be great at what they do. i come along and i talk a big game and they are all waiting for ""the catch""and they get confused that i'm n overtime asking anyone for money.are you guys the only people allowed to be ""nice guys"" and ""help people out""?"
PlusEVAnalytics,like i said on the  podcast though i do think you should stop releasing bets once you hit some pre-defined limit of $ in play. customers have finite account balances and its important for people taking advantage of  years old you are guarantee that they match  years old you are bets as exactly as possible.
aluckyaday,i've lost count of the number of times my luckies have lucked great value wise at 11am but n overtime so good at the end of the day  high profile tipster moves generally come back quite a bit on bfsp as do the early pace moves. still you have quite a bit to play with
aluckyaday,i think  moneyline is misunderstood even by a l overtime of people practicing it.  moneyline finds correlations n overtime causes. ask an  moneyline algorithm to find a relationship between the price of cheese and who will win the world series and it will. it does n overtime mean that relationship will apply in the future
aluckyaday,their edge is certainly n overtime certain . it all depends on their margin of error in their pricing. statistically my edge is much more certain on my bets than the edge you claim their overround gives them. the chance of them having a 10 percent  edge over me is in the millions to 1!!!!
aluckyaday,has boris been out maneuvered. get him to agree something parliament won't. the eu then say its this deal or no deal. if parliament  daily fantasy sports  agree to the deal and they  daily fantasy sports  want no deal then revoke is the only remaining o point ion. which is ultimately what the eu want.
aluckyaday,yes the way they advertise is the main issue. i guess americans have n overtime reached that far in the discussions yet. but if you are sharp you find out quickly enough. i guess the general rule is if they  daily fantasy sports  say they are then they are not. although some adverts a dubious....
aluckyaday,would you prefer doing it in a newspaper or from a device in  years old you are pocket available every weekend for a $50k prize? the american public will ultimately decide. but these books are very persuasive and once you have the app they have a direct communication channel to  years old you are pocket!
aluckyaday,for example can i beat the uk so free throw  book top morning price with bog horse racing market sure i can. can i beat the betfair sp market? the st against the spread say i am beating it but i'm n overtime so sure. can i beat the industry starting price market definitely not.
aluckyaday,but for the square punters you need to feed the sharps price has shown to be n overtime that important. maybe the us will be different. if price is  years old you are main selling point will you be on oddschecker? are  years old you are layers beating top price on there in many markets?
aluckyaday,we  daily fantasy sports  know what they settled for or the reason behind it. but as you say there was a big risk to them if they went to court. n overtime just the payout but the precedent that may have been set.  although personally i think the court would have ruled in 365s favour.
aluckyaday,a problem worldwide that regulators  daily fantasy sports  understand the business and the margins involved there are good reasons why the european model has developed the way it has. one of which is it works in a higher tax environments. you can afford to pay tax if you  daily fantasy sports  have to pay winners
aluckyaday,"""electing him will be a deeply irresponsible decision one that is sym point omatic of a current mindset unfit for a great party and one which if n overtime addressed will cause n overtime only the party damage that could l assit decades but the country too."" how can tory mps n overtime understand this!!!!!"
aluckyaday,i get the impression that pinnacle's strategy is to have the best models in the market and build + expected value positions based on those models. running a book is a good way of ensuring they have the best model. as marco says sharps are consultants who get paid to test o you are models!
EdMillerPoker,"that it felt like a tilted playing field and you could point to someone updating lineups in response to a late scratch and say "" that is  why!"" when really that had little to do with it and some of those ppl i'm convinced were net losers looking at the crap they shoved in everyday"
EdMillerPoker,"respectfully non-us-based sports betting folk...

americans hate the ""palpable error"" rule.  it is  cultural. it is n overtime in  years old you are interest to try to ram it down o you are throats. you will never convince us.

 it is  very much the right idea to figure out how to do business without it."
EdMillerPoker,"well yes we do make o you are own pregame lines but when we make live lines we take into account all available information to make the best line we can and that includes all the market information available to us

we're very much n overtime just plugging in a pregame line and hitting go"
EdMillerPoker,i'm launching a company called deck prism sports   with partners and o you are goal is to be a lines provider to sportsbooks. in other words during a game when you open  years old you are sports betting app and see a betting line we want to be an originator of that line in real-time.
EdMillerPoker,i'm no expert on any of these topics but this mmt idea is n overtime new to me. what never gets said is that as debt levels increase to continue to create demand for  years old you are sovereign debt requires increasing instability in row so you continue to be seen as a safe haven
EdMillerPoker,"the slots just grind you and grind you and it ""feels"" unwinnable. at le assit slots have the carr overtime of a jackp overtime to keep you interested. holding 7+ percent  on 2-way markets where the upside is n overtime even doubling  years old you are money is just n overtime that compelling a product."
GolcondaFund,"n overtime sure why faded lj when i was one of the few who rode tebow through all the way to that playoff win against the league's best defense. 

is it me or does lj prove tebow g overtime a raw deal because no team wanted to buy-in like the ravens have in lj?

 #tebowrevenge"
GolcondaFund,"fair is fair but if laying off due to  years old you are advanced handicapping why so antagonistic to o you are poor beloved public...as if it was a ""bad"" play. curious what  years old you are numbers say. all good though seeya at the finish line in #circamillionaire - all in good fun ;)"
nonrandomalpha,mannings broncos were -27/-28 v jags in 2013; granted it was at home but even if it was on the road using industry standard 3 points for home (+ th against the spread generous for jax) would still have been -21/-22. so this p against the spread like has room to run higher id say...
LeeSharpeNFL,"l assit year in week 17 nagy should have pulled starters at hal free throw ime and let vikings win so the bears could host the vikings in playoffs instead of eagles.

he didn't. hard n overtime to wonder what if. vikings would have been an easier opponent.

and now  it is  vikings resting starters."
LeeSharpeNFL,"acknowledging (privately) that trubisky is bad but running with him in 2020 due to lack of better o point ions is something i can get behind.

but the 5th year o point ion keeps him with the bears through 2021. bears have a 1st round pick in 2021. #tankwithtrubisky and get a good qb then."
LeeSharpeNFL,"n overtime even sure  it is  possible for football to be played on spreadsheets. hard to get the papers to stay in place with people running on top of them.

plus you'd have a computer with a l overtime of memory to have that many rows and columns all open at once. seems incredibly unrealistic."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i took a somewhat different approach from ben's code in that i wanted to actually keep the completion probability in the plays data itself that way you  daily fantasy sports  have to remodel in the code all the time.

it will auto-add cp  years old you are first run-through if you're already using my code."
AndyMSFW,nfl went 2-2 over the weekend.  both winners were on monday night so distaster averted.  i'll figure out closing line value and all that jazz in a spreadsheet later but for now i just need some coffee water and maybe a sit in the steam room.  vegas is hard on an old soul like me.
LockyLockerson,nba win totals have a standard error of about 8-ish vs. wins at end of season so you  daily fantasy sports  necessarily have to target win totals of 50 or higher (although  that is  a great place to start).  since 2000 the lowest preseason win total for an mvp winner was 43.5 (nash).  makes sense.
DannyParkins,yes. antonio brown is a 31 year old wide receiver who has a couple elite seasons at most le free throw . this is a soap opera. andrew luck potentially had a decade of elite quarterback play and over $200 million in earnings that he gave up.  that is  a seismic loss for the league.
DannyParkins,the bears were gassed but aaron rodgers had a hof 2nd half there was no way mack wasn't gonna be gassed who missed all of training camp and kyle fuller dropped a game winning int. bears had fewest players miss games due to injury l assit year and won 12 games ill take a repeat.
DannyParkins,i didnt pack for hiking weather and those are some of my most comfortable swe against the spread but the bottom has a zipper th against the spread frayed and... yea. n overtime a great look but it was too cold for shorts that seemed better than jeans and most importantly im married so idgaf.
Gingfacekillah,nhl is funny because you have the o point ion to bet on regular time only (a trinomial outcome) or with  overtime included (a binomial outcome). since every game ends with a winner via  overtime or the shootout however arbitrary these wins may be there is a binary result. i see what you mean tho
logan_matthews9,can only get $25 on it but castro o3.5 -120 tonight is easy. bernie is the front runner and this is probably the biggest piece of ammunition his opponents have been given. like bloomberg and stop and frisk: if theres a weakness theyll bring it up a l overtime (9x for sf l assit time)
logan_matthews9,its been one of the worst coached games ive seen this bowl season. n overtime going for 4th and inches from the 50. then running a qb sneak twice with less than a yard. then going for it on 4th and 12 from the 30. fascinating someone could be so clueless as to basic probabilities
logan_matthews9,its a terrible result. so was jamaica leading up to the gold cup. but by firing him now you admit the us cant play a possession style and throw away the p assit year. as long as the players are still bought in (and theres nothing to indicate otherwise) you hope they turn a corner
logan_matthews9,"so i tried my hand at golf modeling - the testing process was promising but well see how it goes. heres what ive bet so far this week:
troy merritt to win: +6600
nate lashley to win: +6600
ryan moore to win: +2800
tm vs ryder: -110
nl vs laird:-110
howell iii vs berger: -125"
PikachuBets,elementary question coming from clown with a less than elementary knowledge of betting markets. maybe hm  i do n overtime know  you shouldve figured this out mack when you were on here screaming at us about how closing line value is a circlejerk that is beneath you and  years old you are quantifiably trash quants
PikachuBets,"here's a dra free throw :
""we have made numerous changes to o you are tos. we enlisted the very professional help of anonymous twitter users in this endeavor. please acce point  o you are apology for being hilariously ine point  and continue to trust we will execute everything else from here on out flawlessly."""
PikachuBets,actually even then the whole us women are paid so much less than us men argument is still a fallacy. they are two teams in entirely diff markets. its n overtime how revenue works. best team in the world vs one of the worst. us womens is the top paid womens team in the world
PikachuBets,ulm smashed but buducnost lost by 43.  it is  hard to play the final game of  years old you are playoffs series well when the home fans throw literal bricks at you before the game starts. what a pos. looking forward to fading this crvena team all year next year in the euroleague lol. assholes
PikachuBets,"my complaints with you: 1) n overtime honest with picks (inb4 ""line was at the wynn!!"") and 2) asserting superiority over legit pros who actually earn their living from this. get a fucking clue. gambling twitter is n overtime all made equal.  daily fantasy sports  do those things and we have no beef. goodbye ""cat"""
adamchernoff,relative to the market playing to the middle of their range price wise. significantly more upside from a pricing perspective than bal who continues to exceed their range. have kc playing to a 92 with a high of 95 and bal playing to a 90 with a high of 87. league range 22  points .
adamchernoff,rumo you are has it that there is more going on behind the scenes in chicago than meets the eye. tough to assume sabotage at any point in the nfl but i have heard more than a few people make the case for him intentionally increasing difficulty in the playbook at the downfall of others.
adamchernoff,if the neutral field number is somewhere closer to 13.5 than it is to the opening 10.5 then how high does the opening price go with the sf hfa factored in rather than arizona? the obvious hinge is the -14 (worth right at 5 percent ) the number must go above that but where does...
adamchernoff,some folks reading this may take this and run thinking it is a way to beat the nfl. that is absolutely n overtime the case nor do i encourage that. instead what i hope you take away from this is that game state matters when handicapping the nfl. i believe that the best way to...
adamchernoff,for example the median of oak opponents yards per pass is 7.05. oak has allowed 8.60 yards per pass this season. 8.60 / 7.05 = 1.22 or 122 percent . the oak pass defence has allowed opponents to gain 122 percent  of their expectancy this season. these factors can be used later on. the next...
adamchernoff,personally i layer rub on the ribs initially. i dont wrap them until i can touch the ribs with my finger and n overtime have any rub/sweat come off the ribs. i like to lock in that rub before hitting them with a butter wrap. anything before and that layer of flavo you are disappears.
Ccon8181,n overtime to be a downer but just bc theres #nflpreseason on tonight doesnt mean you have to bet it. football through basketball season is a full on grind. enjoy the l assit few free weeks. take the girl/wife out earn some brownie points for later. or fire away if you need the fix haha
Ccon8181,solid point.. and i agree 100 percent  if that was the only factor (numbers). i use 3 channels of data for each potential opportunity. when wagering in the 2nd half only the straight simulation is an o point ion. so when i say my numbers indicate warriors are the play its 1/3 of my system.
kellyinvegas,well i cant just go on tv/radio and say the math says x so backing up the number with st against the spread and trends help you make the case. how boring would it be if i was just like the math is the math and stood there with a blank stare into the camera
ToddFuhrman,"they're 10-1 for a reason and the 6th favorite in the eyes of oddsmakers

the only playoff team they've beaten is the vikings...if you want count the with over kc to feel better go ahead and do so

i won't discount rodgers magic but the team is average at best; win 3 prove me wrong"
ToddFuhrman,theres some noise in this gents...illinois forces the pick with over 2  minutes le free throw  full compliment of timeouts and showed no urgency on final drive until they had to so chryst deserves heat because team was unpr expected points added red; n overtime as much for this as kicking  field goal  from 3
12Xpert,tell me what stat has predictive value then? l assit 6 games? l assit 38 games? the fact that man city  daily fantasy sports  have kompany anymore? the fact that guardioloa has consistently failed to beat the best teams in europe if he doesn't have messi in his? bookies pay city too much respect now.
12Xpert,"yes binomial. i haven't used chebyshev. i would need a valid a priori reason to do so. simply saying ""my intuition tells me"" is n overtime one. intuition is so o free throw en wrong in matters of probability. ""things that should have happened so o free throw en"" may simply mean you were wrong."
12Xpert,and a good place to start is to wonder why humans like to take risks and make predictions about the future? which i hope is what i did in my book. simply closing off debate because we take a moral objection to something is n overtime effective imo. surely the war on drugs confirms this.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  forget that if you have a million different things (for example a million tipsters) then one of them will be expected to show p-value = 0.000001. that looks great on paper but  it is  simply just telling you  years old you are dice is rolling as it should and doing nothing else.

JambosPicks,thank you for the note that you believe we will pay if we lose. in terms of o you are success that is  years old you are opinion and its fair. we recommend you dont pay for a package but follow us so over time you can see for yourself. registering is free for everyone.
mschwimer,1/2 big news! jambos set up an escrow account with capital one. they will independently verify that we have enough funds to cover o you are total liability updated weekly as o you are liabilities change and we will post a bank letter from capital one to o you are website under the faqs section.
mschwimer,o you are research indicated that cris over tens of thousands of plays was the best book to use for the market consensus in the us.  we tested several books.  i know its n overtime a us book but the goal was to find that book that provided the best market consensus in the us.
mschwimer,3/3 for those who are new to jambos i appreciate  years old you are ske point icism around the guarantee (i would have been too). i hope this will help alleviate  years old you are concerns. as always registration is free to all so you can see for yourself before deciding to subscribe or not.
mschwimer,so you are going to talk about the system i created and you think the best way to do that is n overtime have me on to explain it? what if you are missing something that i could clarify? seems like the best way to get the truth would be straight from the source no?
mschwimer,"id argue you guys are better than any lawyer i could hire! you guys are the only people i have been able to find that hates the touting industry as much as i do!

new ts and cs are up!  we made a l overtime of changes that cizzle suggested. thanks again for the help!"
mschwimer,"now can you please answer my question? i have answered every single one of yours. yet you avoid mine. 

if you believe a single word you say why wouldnt you buy 100+ packages. we are giving you 2.3-1 odds! we have n overtime said no to a single one of  years old you are terms."
mschwimer,hahahahahahahaha. all people of the twitterverse please look at this. if you want to see bullshit in the subscri point ion space look no further. they call us out then when asked to put money where their mouth is they all the sudden are too busy to spend a couple minutes to get it done.
mschwimer,this is such a classic response. bottom line. if you really believe we cant beat the market then buy 100 of o you are 17 week packages. it will cost you 300k. if you are right you get $1000000. we put o you are money where o you are mouth is. question is will you?
RufusPeabody,unfortunately the release price is no longer available to you a sub who wasn't at  years old you are computer when the picks were released. you have a choice: do you bet them at a worse price or pass? passing is usually the wise choice bc what value there was almost certainly gone now(3/6)
RufusPeabody,...for his company. and i think th against the spread kind of what this tout service has been able to do in a way also because lets face it -- their leader is a smooth-talking salesman and hes very good at that. this was neither meant as a comparison of   mcfarland as people (2/3)
RufusPeabody,theres also a team building aspect to it. you dont want all carbs or veggies. if you dra free throw  peanut butter but dont get jelly th against the spread an awful pick. team chemistry matters. it wont be the easiest month to eat out but people voluntarily do things like the 6/12/18/24 challenge.
RufusPeabody,stepping back for a second what's the real issue with jambos?  it is  a bad look for the sb industry that a company can raise $23 mill have no real product and a ceo who spits out trumpian nonsense. will end up hurting companies with real innovative ideas when they try to raise $
SportsCheetah,just from the show and when i write for chalk. and even then volume is a l overtime lower ho you are before games start and stuff etc. th against the spread why we try to bring informative value to the table outside just picks ie. kat/twolves unders dragic/heat unders collins/hawks overs some examples.
SportsCheetah,but they didnt i dont know. if tamu didnt play in the sec now theyd have potentially gone 12-1 too. schools can get smarter at scheduling bunnies earlier if they think its the swing. a 1-loss p12 champ w/out a win over aub non-conf may n overtime get in some years. could help too.
SportsCheetah,so you loaded up on navy l assit week then too? and minnesota? n overtime sure if you're going from chalk article or the show but those were the sides on both. glad you g overtime navy back at le assit smu dead wrong side there up 11 at half and tied late lol
SportsCheetah,det o37.5 -120 - my projection is right at 37 but i'll subjectively say dwane casey is worth an extra regular season win + 37 doesn't account for the tank in the e assit (knicks 3 times feb on + mem/pho/char each once). blake was fantastic l assit year hope he can stay healthy.
capjack2000,"end of game was interesting as the hosts sweat their in-game phi -3.5. nyk hits a late 3 to close within 3 and then they foul embiid with 0.7 remaining. embiid hits the  free throw 's and the hosts are relieved. 

overall they did a decent job and much improved over l assit year."
capjack2000,"once saw a guy get tossed down the steps from the yellow to the dark orange se against the spread ( that is  700-level to 500-level iirc). rolled like a sack of potatoes head over heels. 

i could tell you the exact day that was it was the day pelle lindbergh died. cardinals/eagles 1985."
capjack2000,"correct betfred has used this tactic but they have only made entry into one us state so far. 

as for paddy's dna in fd: they started with ""wacky promos""  in us but quickly scuttled it when they g overtime market share. they put their head trader on tv but only tvg their own network"
capjack2000,"refusing to acce point  wagers based purely on skill is n overtime allowed in nj. they can set lower limits. which they do to just about anyone who wagers with them. 

they believe there is an endless supply of $10-20 bettors out there to fleece. which is why these huge bets are a farce."
capjack2000,"welcome to the show bet365 in nj! 

i hate to start with a criticism but this new user promo of $100 is n overtime going to cut it. you're a year late to the party and market share is already entrenched. 

you need to make a splash or you're going to be a flash."
capjack2000,i guess  it is  time to read the fine print of the iowa sports regulations. it was bound to come up sooner or later. my guess is they will resemble nj in that there is no unilateral power given to the operator and the regulatory body will need to approve or deny wager cancellation.
capjack2000,"hello  and  welcome to my home state of new jersey. i'd like to take a look at  years old you are so free throw ware if you are looking for some feedback.

dm's are open we can exchange email addresses and so free throw  testing sites and all that fun stuff. hit me up."
capjack2000,"if you disagree with their ruling you have 20 days to file an appeal with the njccc. 

i could go into the details of how the njccc differs from the njdge but for now know that the njdge is under the atty general and the njccc is a 3-person panel under the governor.
6/9"
capjack2000,it is  been a year so probably a good time to clarify this tweet. william hill should n overtime be able to do this as an operator in nj. however monmouth park could trespass someone from their property and be within their right.  it is  a loophole that only exists at these racetrack books.
capjack2000,"sends a message to the rest of the team.  it is  n overtime all the goalie's fault but make him the example so that the other guys won't let him down again. 

nhl coach mike keenan once had twins rich  ron sutter on his team. when one wasn't playing well he'd bench the other."
capjack2000,there is definitely a middle ground that can be reached. for instance my previous limit from mgm was $500.  that is  less than i want to bet but at the same time isn't insulting. i was ok with that limit. this latest restriction was a bridge too far for me - hence the blast.
robpizzola,this creates an issue where you need a clear view of exactly where the ball is to overturn on replay. th against the spread n overtime an issue on this specific one is the rose bowl but is o free throw en an issue when theres a l overtime of bodies around the ball.
robpizzola,"as a ra point ors fan its impossible n overtime to be disappointed but this was always the most likely outcome (that kawhi wouldnt return).

masai went all-in to get a title and we g overtime that title. it was an incredible run that ill never forget and im a kawhi fan for life."
RASPicks,updated table to show earnings for $1000 and $2000 bettors using ras service and deducting service fees. ras  college basketball  2nd halves l assit two years is the 62.68 percent  rate l assit fo you are years is the 57.44 percent  rate. off to a 10-5 (66 percent ) start this season. order here:
RASPicks,if you think no one can get down (even with a bot) on o you are releases you haven't tried lately and/or are n overtime very well informed.  also if recruiting accounts from customers was o you are business model we'd have a ton more accounts.  truth is we have turned down countless offers.
VegasRefund,i mean this with all due respect.. if someone is saying that their push was brutal.. do you really think they or anyone cares that you bought a  point? buying  points  feels like the right thing to do.. but  it is  not. you remember the outliers of it working when long term it doesn't.
suuma810,"#jets offseason:

-hired a ~questionable~ hc/oc/dc combo
-only g overtime one new starter for a bad offensive line
-didnt sign/dra free throw  a center
-didnt upgrade cb  edge 
-paid big money to a rb the hc didnt want
-fired the gm a free throw er letting him maneuver free agency  the dra free throw"
ClevTA,shorterning the season  make up the gms with the tourney. the whole issue is the players wont care there's no incentive. so he breaks it up into the top half play each other in one tourney  each tourney win is worth a certain # of overall wins so it makes up for shorter sked
ClevTA,th against the spread n overtime what i meant. when i say it goes to  overtime im saying all th against the spread le free throw  is a hailmary. theres no time le free throw  to get in position for a  field goal . what does denver do with one play from the 50?
ClevTA,well they did beat baltimore already. maybe an easy sked early gets the offense ada point ed to the system and they get away with the penalties bc of who they are playing. so they improve by the time they play good tms? who knows but playing hard sked first is n overtime ideal
spanky,i understand both  years old you are points. he was a dead man walking already. he took a parting shot. again th against the spread n overtime my style but ill be lying if i told you i was never tem point ed to listen to the take-a-shot-devil on my le free throw  shoulder
spanky,"lol i hope youre n overtime serious. wh against the spread next? do i have to tell my stock broker why im buying apple stock. o you are how bout telling the supermarket manager why im buying char minutes ultra so free throw  toilet paper. 

bookmaker/market maker/supermarket sets the price.  customer buys it. period."
spanky,i think beating the closing line in nfl would be worth a l overtime more and would be a l overtime harder to do because the nfl openers are very strong.  compare that to college basketball totals where the difference between opening and closing lines are o free throw en more than 5 points.
spanky,"im n overtime a contest guy. using a proxy is ok for first part of any contest.  howeverif i were a contender deep  i would never use a proxy. furthermore i would personally put picks in seconds before deadline.

seeing the dark side of the business l assit 20 years made me a pessimist"
spanky,touts use subscri point ion money as a safety net for their own gambling.  the best bettors in the world do n overtime tout because no safety net is required.  one is better off educating themselves than relying on someone who has nothing to lose.  -110 is hard. -110 plus tout fee is harder.
spanky,i guess one can look at it as he was fined his entire winnings... but had he lost say 10k judge wouldnt have fined him anything exce point  that he wasnt getting back the 10k he lost. the ruling seems to be based on amount won or lost which is wrong in my opinion...
spanky,"very different world now... al overtime easier and safer for an ""insider"" to call a buddy in jersey to get down than it is to deal with the offshore world.... unless you want to chalk it up as a marketing expense i wouldn't book anything where a ""leak"" could take place. just my opinion"
spanky,for most of you this is a nonissue. i however have thousands of accounts and can n overtime manually bet them all.  i designed so free throw ware back in 2003 to bet multiple outs simultaneously. its ironic how in 2019 we all rely on technology yet 2nd tier bookmakers discourage its use (2/2)
spanky,with all the betting today being online and thru apps i reminisce on the days of betting on the telephone.  my guys and i would have every bookmaker on speed dial a phone in each ear and a phone on speaker all trying to get down at the right price.  it was controlled chaos.
PlusEVAnalytics,i mean its n overtime even about privacy - ive emailed many of you from my personal email and many of you know me irl so theres nothing to hide. i only stay anonymous on here because i dont want this nonsense to be the first thing that comes up when someone googles me.
PlusEVAnalytics,"this is a terrible idea. human nature dictates that each side would claim that the system is rigged against them. 

go read some of those diehard sports team fan blogs and forums and see how o free throw en people say hey you know who really did a super amazing job today? the refs."
PlusEVAnalytics,so...my thoughts on this (n overtime necessarily correct) are - it should definitely be y if all else is equal because the parameter variance is higher. a  moneyline on a dog is like an out of the money call o point ion would you rather have one on a startup or a blue chip?
aluckyaday,that is because the supermarket has decided (its choice) that it wants to sell up to 5 ojs at that price to anyone. but they could if it wanted to legally refuse to sell them to you. some books have decided they  daily fantasy sports  want to operate like a supermarket again their choice.
aluckyaday,n overtime really. overround is equivilent to expected profit margin. you  daily fantasy sports  know that on medicine or a pint either. you  daily fantasy sports  make a purchasing decision based on how much profit the company is making. you make the purchase based on how much the product is worth to you personally.
aluckyaday,agreed. my tweet was mainly aimed at o you are american friends who are finding out that modern bookmaking is n overtime quite what they were expecting. as soon as so free throw s are on the scene mopping up the majority of recreational money sharp books rapidly become unviable in a regulated market
aluckyaday,interesting thought. imho so free throw  books are marketing companies n overtime true bookmakers so a tie up with the likes of yahoo might be a good idea. but i think to truly be able to compete for recreational clients any book would also have to ado point  a so free throw  book model.
aluckyaday,the fact that they can do that gives you a good idea of the number of customers they  daily fantasy sports  have . goes to show that bookmaking is now just a marketing game. the ones that can get the squares to bet more and restrict the sharps the most will be the winners.
aluckyaday,evidence please. this argument has been going on in europe for years. but the books that thrive are the ones that limit. the ones that  daily fantasy sports  either get taken over by ones that do or switch to the so free throw  book model. ask paris smith which is the most profitable model....
aluckyaday,do you know how much tax actually goes to the royals? do you know how much income the crown estate generated for the treasury? do you know what the net cost was? if you understood the uk constitution you would know the queen does n overtime have a sa. precedent dictates how she acts.
aluckyaday,isn't taking away choice from member states everything you are against in the eu  we elect o you are representatives to make these decisions for us. that is why we  daily fantasy sports  have referendums on everything. i blame the uk government for n overtime protecting the uks interests n overtime the eu itself.
aluckyaday,it n overtime ridiculous its a fact the main reason betfair has had issues is because they could n overtime get recreational punters to use it. you are looking at things from  years old you are perspective and n overtime a typical recreational punter wanting their dopamine fix whilst watching a game on tv.
aluckyaday,if he is making money by beating closing line value then there can be a justification to sell picks. he will have already bet before tipping and selling picks allows him to reduce his volatility. if he is n overtime beating closing line value then either he has been lucky or is very stupid!
aluckyaday,the uk does n overtime let citizens decide if laws are acce point able. civil servants draw them up and parliament decides. the eu process is very similar just harder because of the extra layer of the european council and pr rather than first p assit the post. no less democratic than the uk.
aluckyaday,that is the ripping up the union o point ion. but that would open up a big can of worms re scotland and independence. we would then have the border question again with scotland! next time someone has a bright idea to unite their party stop and think of the consequences if it fails!
aluckyaday,"but is n overtime the ultimate aim in a l overtime of those markets to take a position on the right side? ie place a sharp bet? the ""bookmaking"" is used to create the liquidity that allows them to do that? would be interesting to know the ratio of profits from margin vs position"
EdMillerPoker,hold  percent  is amount of money book keeps of total bets if there is equal action on both sides. so say there's $110 each on both sides of a -110 market.  that is  $220 total bet and the winning bet gets $210 payout and book keeps $10. so hold  percent  is 10/220 = 0.045
EdMillerPoker,agree theres a quality-quantity trade off but my argument is 1. err on the side of quality for the sake of ux and 2. the quality side isnt rocket science. we can price 100+ props for any football game and o you are pricing is better than essentially the entire industry at the moment
EdMillerPoker,"tl;dr william hill sold a correlated parlay nine months ago and now that  it is  won wants to retroactively convert the bet to two straight bets

in england this is how they do things retroactively editing bets placed nearly a year ago.

we  daily fantasy sports  want this here. a bet is a bet."
EdMillerPoker,if there's one thing i know about gambling i know that it gets more an more fun the more knowledge you have. the challenge is always there. gambling is never easy street. but i know that if fans learn how to find the good in-play bets that will keep them having fun and engaged.
EdMillerPoker,a detailed answer to this question gets into secret sauce stuff but in general o you are approach is to gather information from multiple sources throughout the game to help us make the best line possible while also getting up faster at timeouts and hal free throw imes than the rest of the market
EdMillerPoker,we're vegan bc factory farming is awful. o you are son (9) is mostly vegan but he's his own person and makes his own choices and sometimes they're non-vegan (tho never meat i think he would be horrified to eat meat). try to avoid worst choices add healthy stuff where we can live life
EdMillerPoker,"the qualitative ""feel"" of gambling is just vastly different when hold is ~1 percent  like video poker vs ~10 percent  like slots. when you play video poker you go thru stretches when you feel like you have a cheat code and the machine will just print money. you almost never feel that on slots."
nonrandomalpha,well of course ucf can only handle playing an sec team a  maximum of once a year and its needs to be in january so they have all season to pr expected points added re while the sec gets worn down all season. in actuality this is the only way its a fair matchup.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i  daily fantasy sports  think this fact bolsters  years old you are case. you seem to be treating it as high uncertainty about replay i look at it more as a stronger bias toward the call standing reducing the incentive to challenge.

(though i'm ignoring pi which is its own confusing and dumb animal.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"yes the plan to trade for picks. the  right thing to do when you're a bad team. getting a good qb is everything and they can take multiple shots at it.

they're in much better shape than the other very bad teams who aren't taking real steps to improve (cin was nyg nyj) now."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this seems hard to measure. even knowing a flag was thrown right as the play started isn't enough you have to know if the qb believes it was on the defense.

maybe if  it is  thrown deep you can just assume the latter is yes. still dunno of a data source on the former."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i wouldn't go that far. plenty of individual moves were bad but pace's overall strategy was solid.

get a rookie qb and invest in supporting cast. i think it works out if he'd hit on qb.

that said he's made enough bad moves that i'd prefer to fire pace. he trades up too much."
AndyMSFW,while i'm honored that you used  years old you are first tweet on me i'm sorry that my trying to keep good spirits when i lose is so grating on you.   the main problem with winning 60 percent  of the time is the 40 percent  of the time that you  daily fantasy sports .
JoeyKnish22,fins looking like the only top 3-5 pick team guaranteed to take a qb team. bengals a bit of a wildcard. some will depend how finley looks how much they fancy the rookie qb class etc. but chase young looks like the best dl prospect since suh. cant see any non-qb go before him.
TheKostos,i wouldn't complain. honestly i really  daily fantasy sports  hate the hire. i  daily fantasy sports  know enough about the guy. willing to give it a shot. again we know garrett stinks. judge might be good. who knows? i like the idea of the p against the spread st coach though i'll say that
EliHershkovich,"110 percent . but you gotta put wiggins in there reags. dude has become a three-level scorer + he and morsell shut down howard.

turgeon has held teams back but first time he's had a senior point guard in cowan + they're loaded with de point h and athleticism. marial back in b10 play."
DannyParkins,contreras. you wouldnt get enough for rizzo and i still think you need a kings ransom for kb so i hope they dont move him. id bet on the drop off coming f assit for a catcher like wc who has already had problems sustaining full seasons and his value diminishes at other positions
DannyParkins,seems like a slight overpay for kuechel but at only 3 years the sox can clearly afford it. nothing n overtime to like about it given their window and minimal financial commitments. worth remembering he was their clear 2nd choice to wheeler but they needed to get a legit guy and g overtime one.
DannyParkins,what i hate about the auto bid for conf champ is what if you get a huge upset that team automatically gets to play for a title? so say uva beat clemson. why do we want to see them be a 30+ point dog to lsu in a playoff game that would feel insignificant.
DannyParkins,candid moment from todd mcshay who said on bama/duke broadc assit that tv was the problem with his analysis of daniel jones who he didnt like as the 6th pick. he had a late 2nd/early 3rd round grade. said because mel liked him they didnt wanna hear the good stuff i saw in him.
DannyParkins,cant believe its been 5 years since sung woo madness hit kc. i had a l overtime of great memories in that city but that story always just sticks out. heres the 30 for 30 short they made on it if you wanna learn the story for the first time or just relive it:
DannyParkins,and to be clear im n overtime saying th against the spread ok or im cool with it just that it happens all the time. it happens in political journalism. everywhere. why this allegation was so outlandish to me was use of threat and that it was anonymous 2nd hand reporting. very sloppy imo.
DannyParkins,there will be millions. if you pay for cable or satellite you pay for all the channels even the ones they dont watch. its why when people said they were stopping to watch espn as long as they still paid for cable they didnt really hurt them cuz they still g overtime their $$$$$.
Gingfacekillah,the main issue i had with including tennis is that there are so many players that you can't get by with the free excel solver add-in for o point imization. didn't want readers to need the paid upgrade with more adjustable cells. the models in the book can however be used for tennis :)
logan_matthews9,"- make a bunch of big parlay tickets broadc assit the ones that hit on social media

- use that to sell parlays to other people which just has to bring in more than you lost on the other parlays that were made

- customers lose twice

logan_matthews9,nate lashely t10 at +600 is one i like but want to see the non-dead heat line. have him at 28.3 percent . bet against him against mcdowell who i also like here +450 vs 30.6 percent . bunch of guys i like who i already have matchup money on - wolff casey mcd
logan_matthews9,thought this was very good.  has a great story that is relatable and very useful for any up and comer - hit weak markets while you build  years old you are bankroll. no need to jump in trying to beat nfl. first time listening to the  podcast but thought the whole crew was good
logan_matthews9,the l assit statement is something i see/hear constantly relating to the usmnt. th against the spread just a frustration at the lack of talent in the pool being taken out on players like jozy - hes better than sargent right now and hed still be better if he played for stuttgart burnley etc
logan_matthews9,i say all that to say - i think long is really really good and would be useful to a bottom half epl team which sure makes his value closer to $10m. but i dont think its reasonable for nyrb to expect that. similar players coming out of ligue 1 arent going for that
logan_matthews9,slightly playing devils advocate ream and long were much wider for a l overtime of it. this is great offensively because brooks can completely control a game but to follow up on  years old you are point - when there is a counter that 6 is vital defensively... which may n overtime suit trapp

PikachuBets,major twitter whores always end up posting stale stuff. yes he will be steam this year but that ain't what i'm talking about. he already posted stale with season win totals l assit week all 3 were 1-2 weeks out. his unit inflating is also off the charts lmao 20u plays. get a clue.
adamchernoff,i guess my question in response to flipping the games around (which is true for sure). what is a sign of a better team? one that consistently gets out to big leads early and wins by a small margin or a team that falls behind big consistently early and wins by a small margin?
adamchernoff,well said especially with  college basketball  totals where a couple thousand can move a game a couple of points a l overtime more opportunity for manipulation. as you mentioned for sites reporting this few if any cite book/bets at specific price. if  it is  all lumped into a  percent  it can be very misleading.
adamchernoff,state (game +/- 7 points) arizona gained just 107 yards of their 357 total (29.9 percent ). of the 204 passing yards for the cardinals 88 came on one single play - which also put the score inside the range to cover late in the game. putting game state aside and focusing on the...
adamchernoff,i am n overtime challenging you nor doubting you. i am just asking what the limit is because i do n overtime know the answer to the question. i am sorry that children that discuss gambling on twitter have made it so any question that is asked is deemed to be challenging or insulting.
adamchernoff,it in turn does a very similar thing. for me it feels like an easy way to piece together a bunch of small simple thoughts into a big picture to get a giant thought about the entire league as a whole. another benefit i have found is that adjustments from week to week are...
adamchernoff,bal was -8.5 in the summer -9.5 l assit week look ahead  opened -13.5 vs arz wk2 . the adjustment of 5 points accounts for about ~10 percent  of movement for implied probability vs avg. which added to their 8.5 preseason price point puts them as a 10.5 win team. adjustment has been made.
adamchernoff,"would have been a fantastic moment...but the pin was le free throw  in. dont care about the advantage rule change or anything. its gross and i hate everything about it. should be up there with tigers walk off on the same green in 08/09 instead its a joke. hate it.

now back to soccer."
adamchernoff,few people will discuss anything matchup related (95 percent  of plays during the game) but god forbid a coach decides n overtime to go for two in the 3rd quarter everyone will beat the topic to death for hours. i just think bettors waste so much time on the wrong thing  basics are neglected.
adamchernoff,"kick in the shins losing on iowa state +125.

Ccon8181,nothing lined up on these games pregame. never going to force action. you never have to worry about me giving out sides for entertainment or attention bc i show proof of my action. one of the benefits of following someone with skin in the game.  best of luck on  years old you are wagers
Ccon8181,another push ... #bears -2 -110. feels like a loss with #bears allowing only touchdown of the game on final drive with 3 minutes le free throw . i know the casual bettors hate to hear it but th against the spread the importance of getting the right number. closed at -3. still disappointing.
ToddFuhrman,wish i was kidding when i said i stopped paying attention to focus on  prep get a text from my old man about a collapse only to check to score and see that monstrosity... it is  why i always say good bets can lose and bad bets win drives you nuts in this biz
ToddFuhrman,"the hardest thing to explain to people is power ratings aren't based off wins and losses...

what i mean is  it is  possible for a team to lose and see their power profile improve while a team can win and see their power number decline.   daily fantasy sports  fall in love with scoreboard watching"
TheCousinSal,"merry xmas degenerates! my best bets:

- p against the spread (-140)

- white to lead in rec. yds. (10/1)

- gary russell special: james develin will score a  touchdown  (+375) 

- gronk to get arrested tonight for public urination inside a waffle house (3/1)

- i will lose every bet listed above (-850)"
TheCousinSal,all in all im going to go ahead and call that a bad first half for the saints. up 13-0 and now the rams have momentum  the ball in the second half.  also - for some reason no cant run the ball. disgusting. ok - i pray to jesus this reverse-jinx has some affect.
12Xpert,i didn't actual say what he has won in betting is down to luck. i would say that almost all of his outcomes reflect luck but his skill ever so slightly balances the good luck over the bad. variance in 1 bet  skill in 1 bet. variance over 10000 bets  skill over 10000 bets.
12Xpert,or you could assume  it is  about 0 percent  if you are targeting best in market prices. but if you do that with recreational bookmakers (all uk and europe apart from exchanges) then they'll ban you for doing that. they'll also ban you if they think you really have +8 percent  advantage over them.
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  necessarily agree that  it is  increased relative to may's deal. with may's deal there was zero chance of getting a trade deal with the us. with no deal there is a non zero probability. one may well say a deal with trump is a bad deal.  that is  another story.
12Xpert,"so i then ask if sports betting is different because  it is  n overtime quite random and allows for prediction models to compete and the possibility of skilled profit how can you be sure that yours is better than others and you say ""look at my profits."" so you have told us nothing (2/2)"

mschwimer,so answer this.  if a person invests 10k in the stock market and gets back 20k total and that same person invests 10k in betting on sports and ends with 100k but made 10000000 in bets (never at risk for than 10k) did his stock market or sports betting get him a better roi?
mschwimer,this is a correct statement as well. but i could say the same thing about subs that bet 100 per game and how much more profitable. we have been consistent and only judge o you are record on o you are recommended $300 per unit. key is consistency and n overtime picking and choosing.
mschwimer,100 percent  agree with this. which is why we made o you are service free for everyone starting on 2/12. everyone can verify who signed up!  notice you have never seen anyone in twitter say we added picks late or fudged a record. and trust me  would have called us out if we did.
mschwimer,all suggestions noted. will talk to counsel. anything that we do n overtime change that you suggested i will make sure i have a reason for n overtime including it. again thank you very much for the help. predicting outcomes of games is o you are greatest strength. ts and cs are clearly not!
mschwimer,you dont think bill and ed are running away? i have agreed to every single term they have said so far. i have told them i will put o you are money up front in an escrow if their choosing. yet they are too scared. only logical explanation is they know they are wrong.
mschwimer,i agree completely! it is n overtime a sustainable model at all. but it takes a l overtime of time for people to believe. probably a year or 2. when that happens lines will move and we wont be able to give advantages to o you are subs so we will shut it down.
RufusPeabody,"lsu and ohio state just need to avoid disaster. both can stomach a loss but can't finish 0-2.

a loss by clemson would be... interesting. their schedule has been ungodly easy. we give them a 40 percent  chance if they lose to scar and 19 percent  if they lose the acc title game."
RufusPeabody,if  years old you are data has any errors you  daily fantasy sports  address -- and with all the new complex data available errors can be prevalant  well hidden -- a black box machine learning-based model can go off the rails. a logical inference-based model is much better able to withstand data issues.
RufusPeabody,makes it seem really easy to win betting parlay. bad bankroll management. etc.  it is  like stories on lottery winners in a way exce point   it is  less obvious to people that this is luck. i wish there would be more stories on guys losing big bets.  daily fantasy sports  encourage problem gambling!
RufusPeabody,this is why the tout industry has the reputation it does. picks are down 7+ units since you started selling but  let us  focus on the  percent  of packages that are profitable. this is just like vegas dave saying he's 50-2 but n overtime mentioning that a loss is 30 units. be better
RufusPeabody,this also is illustrative of the power of the reverse jinx. for a reverse jinx to have any power it has to be done with pure intentions. you can't try to reverse jinx something. doesn't work that way. bet has to be graded early because you think  it is  a loser for sure.
RufusPeabody,"this obviously extends to more than baseball. the easiest way to think of it is with betting ""angles"".  let us  say i find some angle that i believe has a fundamental effect but the market isn't sure about.  let us  assume for simplicity that the effect is binary -- it exists or not."
RufusPeabody,when i was a kid no one complained about food poisoning when they g overtime sick to their stomach. as an adult at le assit among my cohorts if someone is sick they always blame it on something they ate. no buddy you drank too much. or maybe you just g overtime sick.
SportsCheetah,"the energy bus is good takes a few hours to read. i know dabo makes his clemson players read it every year. phil galfond has some really good insights on psyche 

i really took happiness positive expected value to heart over the l assit few years with a family two young kids etc."
SportsCheetah,n overtime quite but also only slightly worse than anthony davis. drtg 82nd percentile. the offense will take a hit imo and n overtime sure when the numbers say bagley was  years old you are worst defender that more bagley at center is going to be better overall. rim protection only a piece.
capjack2000,"ok first bit of faulty reasoning shows early in the 2q. in discussing that the 1h line was 109 but the game total was 210.5 they conclude  that is  because scrubs will be used late in the game which will mean less scoring in the 2h. 

 that is  n overtime how it works."
capjack2000,"this ""fixing"" story is starting to borderline on irresponsible journalism. here's a 25 year old kid who tries to talk a tough game to some mob bosses. his ""fix"" was that he was going to get the favorite to win by more than the spread. 

i guess by giving them a pep talk?"
capjack2000,"skimming through pages of legalese i noticed what i believe to be stronger language around conditions of having an online account.

capjack2000,"that is  actually a huge myth about the regulated environment. i can move $30k from my bank account into any nj book in 2 mins. paypal says they can move $1 million into regulated books with no notice. i can move it back out within 48 hrs.

capjack2000,in a scenario where the market line is 3 a book is taking money at -110 on both sides but has liability to one side. if they shi free throw  to +100/-120 to attract sharp money that money still provides a 2.33 percent  vig on total handle (+100 new money -110 old money).

dinkinc,pass interference is reviewable but it has to be blatent.....make that very blatent so  daily fantasy sports  challenge it if  it is  just common pass interference which we might call at any time ... take the review away... you made it into a joke..plus there are far too many things you cant review
dinkinc,yes...proper gambling is far more important than handicapping...you can be a great handicapper and lose money if you  daily fantasy sports  gamble correctly and/or you can be a mediocre capper but make a living if you gamble at a high level..  the latter is me exce point  for hockey where i am both
dinkinc,1-1 yesterday for the  horses.meh. august will be o you are second losing month in the l assit 14...all great runs come to an end..we never bet more than two unit plays and those are very rare..there are no tout shenanigans since i  daily fantasy sports  make any money doing this.sign up now
robpizzola,there is only one way that leafs/canucks ends tonight and th against the spread with a josh leivo gwg. toronto literally gave him away for nothing because dubas is a nice guy and because babcuck refused to put him in the lineup while he littered the 4th line with plugs. this is destiny.
RASPicks,no i am saying that if you were that certain you could beat big sports markets you would be much better off keeping a low profile and investing  years old you are backers money betting the picks rather than telling everyone about it and trying to start a new tout service from scratch.
RASPicks,why continue selling picks? a) the brand is a considerable asset that could be scaled in future. b) it continues to have strong demand. c) we release 10 percent  of o you are overall volume and n overtime in all markets we participate. d) we've had 20+ straight winning years and are egomaniacs.
RASPicks,i  daily fantasy sports  think you try to monitor a ton of cappers.  some nomination process or criteria would have to be followed.  off the top of my head if a site did detailed monitoring of say ras dr bob rynning warren sharp krackman and handful of others it would be very interesting.
RASPicks,i recently met someone who said hearing me on a podc assit years ago 'inspired' him to give sports betting a serious shot. he is now competing in the same markets we do and is betting earlier. there's opportunity cost involved in any info you give out in any form free or paid.
VegasRefund,thomas should be thanking collins.. safeties l assit longer.. and even at 30 hes worth the g touchdown  $ more than collins is imo. im no dr but depending on the severity i think a broken leg has more of an opportunity to come back at 100 percent  compared to one involving ligaments.
VegasRefund,had a buddy in college who in december called up every nice restaurant in o you are area and made a reservation for v-day.. come february he sold those reservations to all his friends who had waited until the l assit minute to try and book something.. made out like a bandit. genius.
ClevTA,only reason i ask is we knew that if kc won at 1 that watson wouldnt play. obrien saying starters would play during the week is something he had to say bc kc could lose. i hit -3.5/kc  moneyline parlay bc the odds are in  years old you are favor that kc wins
ClevTA,n overtime sure if hes referring to dorsey or n overtime but i really dont think hes done a good job overall. wouldnt be opposed to keeping him and giving him one more offseason but the guy had a historical treasure trove of picks  cap  n overtime sure hes been effective with it
ClevTA,those results are way different if u isolate early drown  thursday night football  (weeks 1-6) vs later in the season mainly bc the advantage for favorites later in the year is magnified as attrition hits all tms. better teams with more de point h  more motivation win and cover vs early in season
ClevTA,the thing with howard is he was terrible l assit year by all efficiency metrics and cant catch anything. he's really just a short yardage guy to me with no upside at all. sanders was the 4th highest sparq rb at the combine and has game breaking ability. he should get the bulk
spanky,"unlike 99.999 percent  of the people in twitter land i actually bet for a living.

spanky,a 100k bet in vegas makes headlines... a 100k bet in asia or costa rica isint as dramatic. ive personally seen them come pouring in.  in vegas a 100k bet leads to panic. in asia its humorous. when you book that high you have to be talanted and have the best technology. (2/6)

spanky,every offshore book i play in has limits clearly displayed for sidetotal moneyline per sport. us books should be required to do the same and stick to them! theres a max sign on every table game why n overtime in the sportsbook!? deposit amounts and who i give most business depends on limits.

spanky,they are all  . golden nugget ac booted me a free throw er a day so they get the dress.  how different are the lines amongst all 3 platforms? if line moves at one does it move at the other?  who has the best margins of the three?   is a fountain of information!
spanky,(2/2) nevada gaming should be made aware of this unscrupulous abuse of power to reject bets at will. this auto mover solution is for bookmakers who want to write business and n overtime simply use sharp players as a line service. problem is there are very few real bookmakers le free throw .
PlusEVAnalytics,1: the barriers to entry are nonexistent - it costs literally nothing to create a pick. th against the spread what attracts the scammers. sure there are honest* pick sellers but there are 100 scammers for every honest* guy. and every one of the 100 is trying to convince you theyre the 1.
PlusEVAnalytics,youve tested for one specific type of inefficiency - a bias in overs and unders. you didnt find it. what if most games on weekends go over and most games on weekdays go under? th against the spread another possible inefficiency that you wont find even if it exists with what you did.
aluckyaday,i disagree. it is up to the customer to decide if the return they are been offered is worth it. the real probability is unknown to both the consumer and the book. if you force the books to offer the other side they can just put it up at 1/10000. you gain nothing.
aluckyaday,you are making those decisions because of the effect dopamine and norepinephrine has on  years old you are brain. as a random recreational punter that does tend to be the driving factor but it is n overtime the rational thing to do if  years old you are only goal is to maximize profits.
aluckyaday,maybe you would be better off starting with the pitfalls of betting. the majority of bettors have no chance of winning no matter what you try and teach them. see the reaction you get when you talk about clv. paying a tout at le assit gives them someone to blame when they lose
aluckyaday,basically lay the bet off at close so you have an equal win or loss on both outcomes. the profit or loss is how much closing line value you got. calculate the roi from the total stakes on both bets and the sum of the clvs. calculate the standard deviation of the clvs.
aluckyaday,directly cc use yes but the issue the gc are now asking about is through e-wallets. n overtime sure how an e-wallet is going to distinguish between sources of funding. if problem gamblers are are already using e-wallets  its n overtime much of a step to send funds from cc to bank first
aluckyaday,"in the mps code of conduct it says ""members have a general duty to act in the interests of the nation as a whole"". i guess it depends on how you interpret that. because the public voted for something in a referendum is it in the interests of the nation as a whole?"
aluckyaday,"correct but the paper referred to anyone placing bets in a weak efficient market that had information n overtime in the price as an ""insider"". it certainly confused me at the time how can there be so many? that is why i queried it. i think it was matthew trenhaile that explained it"
aluckyaday,the way i use this calculator is to set expected yield f3 to zero (assume i'm betting at top price from a selection of books so bookmaker margin will be zero). set g10 to my actual yield then g9 will give me the chance of that yield occuring by chance. is that correct
aluckyaday,agreed. but a large proportion of those punters that could win with so free throw s if n overtime restricted can only do it because of this model. its n overtime just the obvious offers that are part of the model but the pricing strategy too. early horse racing prices being an example.
aluckyaday,as for having an edge over pinnacles own models. in the event that you can beat their models and n overtime just public biases marco blume has already said they  daily fantasy sports  stop until they fully understand where  years old you are edge comes from. guess that could be called reverse engineering
aluckyaday,it would be interesting to here where you heard the 1.2 percent  i would think it would be written down somewhere if that had said it. i would be very surprised if they would run a sports book with the inherent risks for less hold than an online casino with almost zero risk!
theFirmAISports,that makes sense because plays like this didnt get flagged... haha but no seriously i love sfs d! i may think sherman is slightly overrated but still puttin in work out there. jimmy g needs a good game then i think the bay could be getting a ring sunday becuz is that d!
theFirmAISports,i noticed that one looked weird too... they have a light schedule but my model may have regressed them a little too much to the mean... my model isnt as high on packers jets and bills like other people. i also think theyll lose to the bucs but my model has them favored..
joeytunes2,"i lied my whole life when people asked what i do.

EdMillerPoker,g overtime into an argument with deckprism colleague about this product at the show. he was a little more ske point ical and in general preferred traditional teasers. i like the product but we both agreed it should be more transparent by showing you the implied price of each leg on the slip.
EdMillerPoker,"feel like this is a common flaw. as gamblers we are told to focus on the long run and rightfully so.

but the reason you can be successful gambling is because its n overtime actually a long term thing at all. youre actually being right about a zillion small very short term things."
EdMillerPoker,it makes by far the most sense to focus all in-play betting in football on the timeout periods. timeouts o free throw en happen a free throw er a major game event (score change of possession etc) and therefore  it is  a more interesting time for a bettor to contemplate making a bet.
EdMillerPoker,impossible to build an in-game product from it without a dedicated human on  years old you are end watching the game on tv to make sure the feed is right. and at that point might as well just have  years old you are human collect the data and to hell with the feed

nonrandomalpha,wh against the spread  years old you are grip with  his shop is pretty forthright with their services and perspective on the industry. my only grip with him is that his stories and pop culture references are whack and so out-of-date that millennials have no idea wh against the spread he talking about...
LeeSharpeNFL,"it is  trying to celebrate 100 years of the nfl. if (hypothetically) the top wrs all played in the l assit 20 years it doesn't really do that.

 it is  cool to debate the list and all n overtime trying to discourage that but from the nfl's perspective its chief goal is marketing."
LeeSharpeNFL,"a fun fact related to schedule changes:

matt nagy in 31 games with the bears has only lost 2 games by more than one score.

both were the strength-of-schedule 1st place games in 2019 (vs. no at lar).

though it wouldn't shock me if the chiefs make it a third game on sunday."
LeeSharpeNFL,"bad decision by san francisco to kick the extra point when up 4 a free throw er the  touchdown  to go up 5 may hurt them.

now they're only up 2 a free throw er a saints  field goal . the difference between being up/down 4 points vs. 5 points is pretty minimal."
LeeSharpeNFL,"being a fan doesn't mean blind to reality. being the ""o you are qb is bad actually"" fan sucks.

but what would suck even more is the bears making further investment in trubisky because it would most likely put the bears in a worse spot.

and more than anything i want a championship."
whale_capper,sorry i missed these ?s... the vs and are flags to manually void side or void total if you choose n overtime to play what the model would show as an edge without messing up the formulas... as posted the model simply regresses the market implied score and you can go from there
AndyMSFW,"forg overtime to recap the u.s. open (because i lost and  that is  no fun).
outlaid over 20 units during the fo you are days ended up -1.561.  biggest problems were koepka n overtime quite getting there and danny willett playing like it was the '16 masters for stretches.  living and learning! #golf"
JoeyKnish22,"gonna steal this segment from the bearded guy on espn. if i had to play every conf champ game:

oregon +6.5
cmu -6.5
laffy +6
baylor +9.5
fau -7/-7.5
memphis -10
hawaii +15
uga +7
osu -16.5
uva +28.5

only ones at current id actually play for a full unit laffy/fau (tbd cmu)"
JoeyKnish22,"n overtime a sp overtime player but like ole miss +21  (couple square shops offering the hook). also took under 65.5 and 1h +11. 

lsu b2b roadies with a make shi free throw  ol against a rebels team playing pretty competitive ball for 4-6 weeks that had basically a bye l assit week."
JoeyKnish22,you would need some fancier math than im willing to do to put a proper price on this. but i went back 5 years (approx 1280 games) and didnt find a single week where at le assit one team didnt score 30 points. safe to say -160 over is a bit short at
JoeyKnish22,"lsu was identified l assit week as a play on future and against the spread  wise before a big game. 

texas tech same sp overtime for me here. think they are under valued market wise and arizona a great matchup for them to exploit. ive played -2/-3 large and sprinkled +4000 b12 futures."
JoeyKnish22,saw ppl saucing this episode finally g overtime around to it. the conversion between the 30-50  minutes mark is some of the best rsw analysis youll ever hear. would highly encourage anyone to carve out at le assit 20  minutes and listen guarantee it will make you a sharper rsw bettor long term.
TheKostos,while we wait for the fan to be removed i have a movie take: i saw a star is born (late to the pay i know) and thought it was one of the best movies i've ever seen. and there's nothing anyone can say to convince me cooper/gaga aren't actually in love lol
TheKostos,heres a hearty eff you to the  for this aj green bullshit. just deactivate him! why waste a roster space! why tease fantasy owners! why did you n overtime trade him! why are you starting ryan finley! why did you hire zac taylor? why did you n overtime cover against baltimore? why did
LockyLockerson,"widely-available things i bet for saturday.  this will pin in my profile in place of the nba model but i'll put nba back up at the end of the night for those looking for that (you probably have the link saved).

part 1 (early):
12p purdue -9.5
12p army -9.5
12p k-state +23.5"
LockyLockerson,its possible  years old you are read on the game was great and  years old you are rating in  years old you are head for teams was really smart.  i would say that in general there are very few layups even when you think you have the best of it.  just my opinion.
LockyLockerson,a free throw er games start tomorrow a l overtime of sites take a l overtime of bets off the board for the season.  futures come down and considering florida-miami is a game in week 0 the market will be different when it re-opens.   let us  get o you are finalized bets together!
DannyParkins,khalil mack is a better player and it was a historic move in terms of both dra free throw  capital and dollars for a defensive player. mitch trubisky will be the move that likely defines paces tenure. but in terms of value ill be very surprised if ryan pace ever surpasses eddie jackson.
DannyParkins,feel good? no. but i wouldnt fire him. because then you have no continuity and a new gm would want a new coach and round and round the cycle goes. this team is largely gonna be the same next year given picks and cap space. id see it through another year with pace/nagy.
DannyParkins,nowhere in my contract does it say im supposed to be a homer or neutral. my job is to have as many listeners as possible. i just tell you how i truly feel and let the chips fall. that was my honest reaction to the stafford news but i obviously hope im wrong.
DannyParkins,lol. hes been hurt recently surrounded by backups. pat mahomes won the mvp l assit year in his first year as a starter with over 5000 yards and 50  touchdown s which had been done twice ever by guys named brady  manning. if you dont give mahomes credit youre n overtime paying attention.
DannyParkins,yup every ho you are will be podcasted a free throw er the show. it was basically... this guy is an all-time great who is relatively anonymous and has some distinctions i dont think most people know (1 of 4 with 30k  points /10k rebs for ex) just an appreciation of his greatness.
Gingfacekillah,hopefully my data science msc helps me to get closer to  years old you are level in this respect. went with python for the database design and management strengths. like you said if you set it up right you can test faster increase  years old you are rate of failure and eventually succeed.
Gingfacekillah,marc gasol l assit year. cruising at around 35 minutes; a key team piece when they do actually win. mem goes an outrageous 4-20 to finish out the season. the trendline tells the story. notice how it gently curves away from 35 min. as the reality of their season sinks in around feb.
Gingfacekillah,it was just a rough estimate taking the s touchdown  expected value of the entire league and the mean rating into account. i think more accurate would be to track individual team ratings over time and apply s touchdown evs to each one. surely some teams have a smaller strength deviation than others.
logan_matthews9,"alright yall are like 5 for 5 on my low percentage requests so ill try again:

does anybody have good sh overtime or play by play soccer data? i made a formal request to o point a but never heard back. will literally take anything i can get but would love mls/usl especially"
logan_matthews9,it definitely is. a trade exce point ion is the same thing as having the salary on the books - it normally doesnt matter because teams are o free throw en over the cap so its irrelevant. they have to renounce all their fas to sign kemba at which point sts arent possible
logan_matthews9,"three bets tonight:
kings +11
den/sac over 230
la/no under 237
i think the nuggs are slightly overrated a free throw er their f assit start and barton will be missed. defense o point ional and the kings play at the fastest pace in the league. clippers play fourth slowest and good defense"
PikachuBets,"come on you can't be serious writing this off as a ""mistake"" that they're allowed to make. this was a n overtime so subtle ine point itude that shows you how little they care about protecting their customers.  that is  an immediate loss of credibility.  daily fantasy sports  care it was ""fixed."" non-negotiable"
PikachuBets,if you werent such a fucking fraud scum tout then ppl wouldnt hate. going on interviews talking like youre a hotsh overtime but all you do is peddle bullshit like i grind so hard and you just need to know when to get out and then justifying touting. just fucking stop you skinhead
PikachuBets,/3 also heard firsthand about someone's little brother asking to borrow $5k to fund an acct to hook up. college kid with $500 to his name. this is the audience that gulps up berryhorseshit by the gallons. they  daily fantasy sports  know any better and berry uses them to feed his public ego.
PikachuBets,great question op. i  daily fantasy sports  think michael jackson will be showing up to games any time soon. as for michael johnson i think i agree that it will give an extra kick esp for the bulls who are my dark horse pick to run deep this playoffs. p.s. always unload. alwayz
PikachuBets,to aspiring cucks: one of the most critical skills to have in  years old you are toolkit as a clueless gambling twitter tout is how quickly you must move to block people before the bad pr gets more views. took this guy like 1  minutes only. a++ work there f- work on prices
PikachuBets,yes let a white male tell us what doors are shut or n overtime for minorities in america! clearly you are speaking from personal experience? clearly you have families or friends who live this life? clearly you refuse to acknowledge even the marginal possibility this is n overtime in o you are heads.
adamchernoff,every week 17 game is a divisional rematch so it is n overtime surprising to see bettors continue to pile on. as of this morning all but 3 of the 16 games on sunday have been bet down since open. dal wsh ne mia and gb det are the three exce point ions.
adamchernoff,by the end of it i g overtime into laying a couple dozen servers each day on their serve up 40-x playing onto 5-x lead or for the set. it was purely a serving scalp. buy when the ball is bouncing green/red out post point announcement. could never do it at a non-exchange.
adamchernoff,and the time i put in for work each week. if you haphazardly take a run at making this work it will likely end badly. but based on the dms i get many people want to create ratings but struggle with adjustments week to week. this way of thinking could benefit those folks.
adamchernoff,"let us  again keep it basic an assume that all adjustment was made on bal. if you add 10 percent  to the original 0.531 number for rsw that gets 0.631. 

16*0.631 = 10.09 wins. 

while win totals are n overtime efficient numbers the relationship between teams and price point is very real and..."
adamchernoff,look ahead prior to the games playing l assit week from westgate was bal -9.5 so it was adjusted properly and was a fair price. it opened this week at bal -13.5. if you grade arz neutral (for example) then bal must account for the difference between -9.5 and -13.5 (~10 percent ).
adamchernoff,"if there was a textbook on bookmaking cha point er one would be ""pricing to 100"" as it is the first step to pricing an event for betting. very simply put it is coming up with an implied percentage for all participants in an event (game) which when summed equal 100 percent ."
adamchernoff,l assit world cup there was a match (new zealand v south africa) where the favourite switched 45 times. wild profit out there for those who can figure it out. was also able to confirm that the record for a tennis match was $85000000. murray vs djokovic in 2012 at the us open.
adamchernoff,"fo you are matches in a row peru has been bet down heavily. with so much crossover between the 2018 wc and this #copaamerica it is fair to say this is the fi free throw h match the team has been bet down in a row. results will finally come. 

tactical breakdown here:"
Ccon8181,wow that rarely ever thrown flag against the #saints at the end of the half ke point  the over from hitting 1st half and the game on pace for the over. live over under now 43 below open of 44.5 that was then bet up to 49  #indvsno # monday night football xespn
Ccon8181,#texans need to refund anyone who purchased tickets to the #denvshou game today. its one thing to lose but its another to put in zero effort. one of the most embarrassing efforts ive ever seen. no side in the game. however  years old you are think theyd have some backups that would try.
Ccon8181,ive made it clear from the beginning. each bet is the same unit risked. just because i show a 20k ticket or 2k ticket. i have to sometimes spread the action around. i wont ever show all of my tickets on a game. but announced that each game is same risk from beginning
ToddFuhrman,and honestly i'd have no problem with that but  it is  n overtime that simple...1k becomes 5k becomes 1m as wealthy boosters find ways to funnel money to players.  recruiting is a dirty game that would only get worse imo with a handful of schools paying everyone ripe for more corru point ion
12Xpert,this strategy is nothing to do with pinnacle.  it is  simply wisdom of the crowd at so free throw  books.  it is  inferior to mine because it uses the average of so free throw  book odds to then find outliers. far better to use a sharp book like pinnacle to do that job.
12Xpert,sadly  it is  going to be difficult for liverpool to overhaul the record of 102 since the first 5 games in the current 38-game stretch were all 3-pointers. they would need to win the next 6 in a row to ensure their loss to man city on 3rd jan 2019 drops out. unlikely.
12Xpert,"there will always be ""fresh meat"" hence  it is  a great conce point  for the betconnect owners  it is  just i'm n overtime particularly convinced that  it is  of sustainable value for non pros. initially it might be for pros but if the non pros get banned and become non pros then what?"
12Xpert,think about it. why do 2 people engage in a contract. 1 buying. 1 selling. the both can't be right about the price. if there is commission involved likely both will be wrong. but the still do it. why? are the irrational? financially yes. but they play to play n overtime to win.
12Xpert,that is  kind of stupid on their part because i'd have thought you're far more likely to increase turnover if they offer you 2 percent  and make more profit from you. suggest to  years old you are account manager that you would certainly be increasing turnover by more than a factor of 5/2.
12Xpert,presumably qatari government want the self promotion for their nation and iaaf want the most possible money. fans and athletes are n overtime considered. personally i think  it is  similar for a l overtime of us tennis atp/wta tournaments which o free throw en have mostly em point y stadia for early rounds.
12Xpert,that is  how it worked for major brown and may. if you want to change that for example become a republic vote for parties who want that too. if enough of you vote for it you win and get to change it.  that is  democracy. until then quit whining. kinda like brexit really.
12Xpert,alternatively you go to a match on grass watch 2 big servers with no other weapons bash down serves for 3 days before one of them dies. th against the spread n overtime good either. entertaining players can deliver a spectacle on any surface. sport like theatre is about making and telling stories.
12Xpert,sample was same as l assit week (54615 odds from 18205 matches). i do realise that i'm still kind of comparing oranges with lemons really we need either 538's odds at closing or we need pinny's odds at the time 538 publish their predictions. but still  it is  of some value i think.

mschwimer,in addition i will have my dms up during the call.  so if any questions come up as a result of my answers i will be able to answer those as well!  sorry for late notice but wanted to get this out before week 1.  thanks again to all the new registered users!
mschwimer,i hope you guys are ready. im about to step this whole game up. g overtime o you are general counsel to come in h overtime on twitter tomorrow to answer all legal questions!  unlike me he has tons of experience in the space. previously was gc at mgm. this will be fun.
mschwimer,for the record. i know a l overtime of people that know ed from  have n overtime heard a single bad thing about the guy which is incredible given the space he is in. i simply have a problem with the current tout industry because they are n overtime transparent or financially accountable
RufusPeabody,i do share some picks (in big market sports where i'm less likely to cannibalize my edge). but i make my living betting. if i gave away everything i'd have no edge le free throw . n overtime sure how that makes me a fraud. i'm n overtime selling anything to anyone.
RufusPeabody,why does closing line value matter? the price discovery process. it indicates that other people who influence the market are on the same side. it matters bc no model (or intuition) is perfect. the best bettors are humble enough to know that their opinion isn't the only one that can have value.
RufusPeabody,the big difference from vegas is the lack of clear posted limits. in vegas books are upfront about limits.  it is  n overtime a guessing game. i personally prefer this. i think  it is  the most transparent and the most fair -- and americans care about the perce point ion of fairness.
RufusPeabody,koepka feels like the tiger of old. when he's g overtime a lead and playing well it just feels like  it is  over. (note this is how it feels to me. it is n overtime intended to be any sort of predictive analysis and i'm certainly n overtime betting based on it.)
RufusPeabody,to be clear i  daily fantasy sports  think  wanted my bank statements for any nefarious purpose. i think they have a company policy to some due diligence if you are looking to increase  years old you are deposit limits. makes sense to try to make sure you're n overtime a problem gambler.
RufusPeabody,you didnt release picks vs best available; claiming record vs that is disingenuous and im v suspicious of the accuracy of the data. furthermore you said clients werent able to get down at  years old you are release price so how would they get a better price?! this is ridiculous mike mike
SportsCheetah,this one was fun but as i just started searching again i am saddened to say she deleted all of the tweets calling me a faceless betting source that was trying to make a story up to move a betting line (ttu had a bye that week). information is good to have
SportsCheetah,"and more talking than posting is just nonsensical. i literally post a position on every  college football  side every fri night for people to use as a guide 
its fun for bob to piggyback a 1-4 week from 7 weeks back from an article (those ones 28-20 on year) but come on"
SportsCheetah,was their projection accounting for 0  minutes from rondo and caruso who were both game-time decisions? regardless fact they just iso-posted ad so o free throw en and had everyone standing around on offense  made it very easy on an elite lac defense (yet they ke point  doing it). it was weird.
capjack2000,"if they're going to be talking about props this much they really should talk about the vig. 

for those n overtime in the philly area sixers simulc assit some games on a betc assit where the announcers strictly talk about betting implications of the current game.  it is  a work in progress."
capjack2000,he seems like a big enough assit ros fan that i'm sure he still believes they can win. however what he's really doing is hedging a bet on wsh (via the mattress sales) with his hou sports wagers. right now he's in a good position to profit more with the mattress sales.
capjack2000,"i think we all agree there. however the lack of transparency on where the boundaries are leaves both sides with spiteful feelings. 

if a book set guidelines they'd find many sharps would work within them. instead they  daily fantasy sports  because they  daily fantasy sports  want to have to abide by them."
capjack2000,"i  daily fantasy sports  want to get  years old you are hopes up or down but  that is  betstars and their product in nj hasn't been groundbreaking. their pricing is mediocre. their promos aren't compelling. they use too many one-sided markets for derivatives. 

they could stand out but so far they haven't."
capjack2000,"one more thought about william hill running all czr/eri books:

if you add up the properties in states which already have or will have betting in 2019 that is 30 additional retail books for william hill to takeover or open. 

i  daily fantasy sports  think they can scale that big that fast."
capjack2000,for the most part they have a low barrier to entry as well. $45k license fee 7.5 percent  tax rate. need to be tethered to an existing casino (19 of them). that can make it tougher for a true startup to get in the game. in-person registration is a downer for ia.
capjack2000,matt im n overtime sure why you think sports betting should exist solely in the boxes it has for decades? imo european bookmaking has failed. its time for different approaches. in fact i say betting on sides/totals has failed. theres a l overtime of innovation to be had in a free market.
dinkinc,that was excellent...  my issue is i  daily fantasy sports  believe i am good enough to increase my handle... if i devote more time to getting better it would cost me time spent on sports... i wish i have the confidence to get to that level where i may have an edge..
dinkinc,its a weird situation sometimes because yelling insults to heels is acce point able until it crosses the line.. but most fans think if its cool to say you suck how can i get ejected for saying  youre ugly .. i totally agree with you but educating the fans is near impossible
dinkinc,n overtime sure if you have been but you might want to use some of  years old you are newly created free time to get to saratoga... just a pleasure to see a track like this is still around... i highly doubt racing will ever go forward again which is very sad
robpizzola,"just so i cover all the angles here...

my numbers say bruins/sharks most probable cup.

my gut tells me bruins/blues cup.

if i had to bet series prices at current market id lean canes/blues.

i have big futures on the canes so i really need the bruins to lose.

that is all."
RASPicks,if you really do win long term and bet at a reasonable scale the entire market will see and factor in  years old you are line moves and most of the people who matter are going to have access to  years old you are exact plays regardless if you are selling/tweeting picks.
RASPicks,big  college basketball  card and ras 2nd half service starts tonight.  we hit 74 percent  on  college basketball  2nd halves l assit year.  we are n overtime likely to do that again but needless to say we are a big favorite to win in this market.  vote first sign-up for ras second.
suuma810,"mock picks that make sense to me:

3. nyj -  overtime williams (or down-trade). the #jets need to help darnold and improve this porous ol.

8. det - te hockenson. patricia wants to run the ball and gets gronk lite.

10. den - cb murphy. can play the kyle-fuller-role in fangio's system."
suuma810,i looked at how much rush efficiency is correlated to pass efficiency during a game. spoiler: it isn't at all. here is the correlation between rush dvoa  pass dvoa for #nfl offenses in single games in 2018 (n=386). only 1 percent  of the variance in pass dvoa is explained by rush dvoa.
ClevTA,only? so its n overtime the never addressing by far the biggest weakness at ol even with tons of assets  a free throw er overpaying first hubbard? or consistently ignoring character  trading up for a guy like callaway? or completely whiffing on multiple top 3 round picks? theres a l overtime here
spanky,"being good at what i do takes place in the real world. being obnoxious is only a twitter thing. 

anyone who knows me personally knows im very chill and easy going and pretty friendly. 

but in twitter world where the hate and jealously run deep ill go over the top and flex."
spanky,"george here is focusing on one game. if you can take +4 on a game that closes pickem a million times i promise you that you would be very happy with the results. 

stop looking for a winner or a shortcut.  beat the closing like and the winners will come pouring in."
spanky,"big difference

i extract money from bookmakers n overtime my fellow bettors.
i dont need you to buy anything from me- i just need to bet.

im banned worldwide from betting with the v assit majority of bookmakers.

the videos i post are a small sample of what i experience weekly offshore"
spanky,twitter world is a funny place. a few like stuff i tweet which is cool. then theres the same c against the spread who comment/like/retweet anything and everything contrary to me. they never miss a beat.  living life with that much dedication to hate is so wasteful. to each his own. #keephatin
spanky,a younger foolish spanky felt this same way.  this adversarial attitude of player vs. bookie is in my opinion an amate you are approach. i've earned the respect from all the bookmakers who know and book me personally because we both try and reach a happy medium so we can all earn.
spanky,i appreciate the kind words but this is an entertainment show. rufus and i are n overtime entertainers. we are professional sports bettors with nothing to sell. watching me work would probably put people to sleep.  would be fun to watch a free throw er you put a few drinks in him
spanky,said all the years he worked for billy walters billy only complained about one person - me.  hate is inevitable when you reach the top of  years old you are cra free throw .  thanks for confirming the huge imprint ive made on the business.  ill take it as a compliment!  #keephatin
spanky,im n overtime a tout. i dont give out or sell picks. i make my living extracting money from bookmakers n overtime my fellow bettors.  im pretty good at betting. i lose many accounts weekly. i have a good reputation amongst my peers both on the bookmaking side and the betting side.
spanky,ahhh steve.. i have 1000's of accounts.  all my betting partners love me. you obviously must be a former betting partner of mine who had a bad experience.   daily fantasy sports  be upset.  you can call me anytime... if you chose n overtime to th against the spread ok too.  good luck
spanky,i was so happy to hear  on  yesterday. andy sold me my first data set back in 1999. i owe a huge part of my success to him.  just had the pleasure of speaking to him again. next time i'm in town dinner on me  without you there would be no spanky.
spanky,consistently laying heavy juice despite how sure  of a bet it is will ultimately lead to bankru point cy..  you never hear a pro say they found value in the 20 to 1 sh overtime they laid. instead you will hear about the value in the 20 to 1 dog they took.
spanky,great point.   lawmakers should tell these european bookmakers and anyone else looking for a license -  manage risk effectively without the need to resort to the extreme measure of kicking out o you are citizens. otherwise you are n overtime welcome to have a license to book in o you are state.
PlusEVAnalytics,i have money on ascoli to beat genoa today. ascoli sounds like something that would be delicious and genoa i think is maybe the setting of romeo and juliet (?) and/or the young and the restless (??) couldnt find either place on a map or name any of their players. happy tuesday!
aluckyaday,i know. just pointing out a way to see how much data you actually need to make any significant conclusions. although n overtime really designed to do it i find p-values a good way to do this. the amount of data you need varies drastically depending on the price of the bets.
aluckyaday,i guess the uk model of taxing the books is based on the fact that in theory it is a zero sum game for the players. for all profits there will be bigger offsetting losses if cost of playing are taken in to account. net tax revenue from players should be negative.
aluckyaday,this is what brexit is really about. reducing regulation and taxation for the elite. the irony is they have g overtime the working classes to do their dirty work for them by hiding behind a populist message. you only need to see who is funding the campaigns to see who will benefit.
aluckyaday,i use 2 statistics. positive expected value calculated using the price i advise and bfsp as the true probability and the p-value calculated from my returns assuming i have zero edge. i have both + expected value based on bfsp and a tiny p-value from 4660 bets. i'm confident with my edge
aluckyaday,if you are getting more + expected value on the place than the win then i would think each way would be a better bet? n overtime sure how to prove that. generalized kelly raises its head twice in one day are you staking these using that or the normal kelly  formula?
aluckyaday,his comments seem to show a l overtime of naivety of betting markets.  assuming his model knows more than the market  it may know something that the market does n overtime but the market certainly knows things his models  daily fantasy sports  him ignoring the predictiveness of markets completely says a lot
aluckyaday,maybe they  daily fantasy sports  want to book them? are the margins there to cover the customer acquisition costs of a so free throw  book model? my guess is they plan to gradually wean us recreational bettors off point spread and on to high margin prop betting and bet builder type products.
aluckyaday,the books they use tend n overtime to mind being arbed. in fact the likes of pinnacle etc encourage it. n overtime sure if sportmarket do it but a l overtime of the asia aggregators profile you and will take some of  years old you are action themselves if they see fit!
aluckyaday,92. but a lucky is a big variance bet! the losses are only about a 1 in 20 chance with no edge although quite a bit less if i use the average! if i'm going to worry about sunday losses i should do the same about the 72 percent  profit on saturdays!
aluckyaday,never hear of the favorite longsh overtime bias tony? if you are a recreational punter betting for fun and the excitement of having a winner (which most punters are) favorites are the way to go. betting early with bog i would think its very close to break even. fun for almost free!
aluckyaday,so free throw  books are entertainment companies n overtime bookmakers. they are selling the excitement of having a bet n overtime the opportunity to make money. in reality you are n overtime restricted for winning but for taking prices that are set to maximize profits from recreational n overtime to beat sharps.
joeyisaks,instagram stories are just one big i voted sticker today. n overtime saying i post cool stories but saying go vote or posting the i voted sticker p assit the age of 26 should be banned also no one cares who you voted for but at same time go sleepy joe today!
joeyisaks,is usc going to acce point  low income students / make it more competitive and hard to get in why n overtime do a sliding scale tuition where its slightly higher for families that combine over 500k etc and slide it down where 80 is free 81-100 is 5k a year etc
EdMillerPoker,"been a while since i updated y'all about 

tl;dr we've improved operations considerably since se point ember and o you are nfl and  college football  product are firing on all cylinders. we so free throw -launched  college basketball  at season-start and  it is  looking good. watch out for expanded coverage coming soon."
EdMillerPoker,i started a thread this morning where i suggested trying to be everyone's 2nd book (because you  daily fantasy sports  do everything but you pick something and do it great) and everyone told me what a fool i was and look at me now i just invented an entire archipelago's entertainment economy
EdMillerPoker,"think of sports betting operators like restaurants. ""the product"" is a meal. that meal could be a huge salad or a 7 course tasting menu or a burger and fries. that meal can be well executed or poorly executed. and even if you usually like burgers you may also eat salads sometimes"
EdMillerPoker,so say you bet $200 on the -200 to win $100 for a total cash price of $300. to find equiv bet for +160 you divide $300 by +160 in decimal odds which is 2.6. so 300/2.6 = $115.38. so  that is  two tickets on each side that both cash for $300.
EdMillerPoker,he was a relentlessly positive person.. even his rivals i think would find it hard to dislike him. as far as i could tell he was poor his whole life and despite being for many years one of the top players in the city and state he charged almost nothing for lessons
EdMillerPoker,found out recently that my chess coach when i was a kid alfred carlin died l assit year. he was a special man. from what i know he taught himself to play as a kid and from that point he shared the game with anyone he could in new orleans for decades
GolcondaFund,once lost 12k entry on dk to wsop champ because an eli manning sack was rescinded. as he fell knee touching ground tosses ball behind him to offensive lineman penalty ruled instead of sack while getting crushed by eagles late in 4th. eli - could have cost up to a few  million
GolcondaFund,"unpopular handicap by most bettors - this is why i stopped betting horse races. they have 0 say in their treatment and a broken leg is a death sentence. imagine if we put patrick mahomes down a free throw er a banged up knee...

sometimes making $ is n overtime worth it."
GolcondaFund,"well we have until 3pm saturday to make picks and to rush 5 selections for a thursday ""slam dunk"" really isn't worth it. proof in point o you are sc picks we make friday night sat circa sat night 5 core nfl bets:
10-5
12-2-1
13-2
every extra minute counts i presume."
GolcondaFund,this is make or break year for winston especially with his off field baggage. he is set up to succeed with arians and the bucs will be the surprise team in the nfc if he steadies the ship. tough to get to 9 wins which will make it that much more impressive.
LeeSharpeNFL,"having faith in  years old you are offense = a good reason to go for it

having faith in  years old you are defense = a good reason to go for it

if bears do win this game (they will not) it will be on the back of poor andy reid decision-making."
LeeSharpeNFL,"so it is true as  was tweeting about today that hfa is an outlier for 2019.

 it is  worth noting that when i looked at this earlier this year it wasn't that much of an outlier compared to 2005. but 2005 did come back far more than it did in 2019.

however...."
LeeSharpeNFL,"the ""double doink"" game depressed me i think more than most bears fans. i knew we were on an unsustainable high and a ""one season wonder"". 

losing a playoff game as 7 point favorites knowing  years old you are next season is likely gonna be mediocre is frustrating.

gl  enjoy the ride."
whale_capper,id also be pr expected points added red to cash out but no need to rush it rams have a high likelihood of winning today then bye week dont really get tested until late nov... if sf or sea takes a loss or two that number has the potential to get better

DannyParkins,the bears have to pick up mitch trubisky's 5th year o point ion by may 3rd. free agency opens march 18th. those are the dates to circle to judge the bears' actions at quarterback n overtime their words at a new year's eve press conference when he's the only guy under contract.
DannyParkins,the majority of teams treat london like a regular game and go over later in the week like the bears. the raiders are on the west co assit and g overtime crushed in london l assit year so they switched it up and went early. please dont blame this ass-kicking on travel.
DannyParkins,i plan to bring my experience of betting my whole $700 bankroll on ku over cuse in 03 at the age of 16 n overtime hedging $500 30:1 on the royals in 14 and n overtime hedging $200 clemson 30:1 in 15 to the show. wait why did you guys hire me?
DannyParkins,fox cnn and msnbc all aired klobuchar and biden. fox went split screen with warren but the networks missed her speech bc she started seconds a free throw er biden. msnbc immediately noted theyd re-air warren. seems all candidates are gonna get a chance to air a victory speech with no data.
Gingfacekillah,embiid with 2 pf a free throw er 1q. if this game continues playing out as forecasted you can expect him to hang back pick up drbs and ease up on his paint drives. th against the spread the basic rationale behind this thread the needle play. a positive sign so far.
Gingfacekillah,"sac -0.94. pretty tight. i think you're directionally right but n overtime much value there imo. 
okc +1.39. pretty tight there too.
det 1h 112.3. i think its likely det comes out sluggish and the under hits.
think you've g overtime the right direction on these plays but the edges are slim."
Gingfacekillah,1 - 0.3764 = 62.36 percent  theoretical prediction ceiling. pinnacle l assit year was a touch over ~61 percent .  years old you are maxed out possible nhl earnings assuming an o point imized model would be 1.36 percent  +/- prediction variance in both  years old you are model and the market.
Gingfacekillah,youre basically going to use random sampling with replacement to turn a sample of 20 games into 500 games or whatever number you choose. this gives you a confidence interval for  years old you are distribution and makes the distribution fitting more reliable. best of luck with  years old you are model!
Gingfacekillah,"of particular interest here if you are a modeller is that the most accurate ""true odds"" can be a powerful feature in  years old you are model. logarithmically pooling ""true odds"" with  years old you are model's forec assit will boost  years old you are  percent . 

see: bill benter [pg. 187]:"
Gingfacekillah,ah yes the em point y net skew. thank you for the reminder i'll have to adjust for that. agree with you this isn't my best performing model. i've had more success with latent team ratings. trying to make this one better to see if it can have any value long term.
logan_matthews9,i didnt explicitly make it about race - i made the comment about people who think lamar isnt good who came out of hiding when he had a bad game. i then stereotyped who that would be - weirdly here you are getting defensive over the white guy comment and defending tannehill
logan_matthews9,"2 red flags here

1) giving recommendations the day of kickoff
2) getting the worst of the line - opened at 49 closed at 48.5. i never even saw 49.5 so its particularly bad

dont know if he charges but this guy isnt a long term winner. thanks  for pointing him out"
logan_matthews9,i dont have specific contract data but gonzlez had only signed with columbus the year before. and its great that long had a good season with mls but literally the best thing you can do for inflating  years old you are value is have a great wc so it doesnt compare imo
logan_matthews9,trying to get a weather score for every sh overtime seems like an exercise in futility. the great part about golf is theres enough sh overtime data where that shouldnt have a dramatic impact on a player rating but perhaps if it scores were so impacted that may make a round(s) invalid

PikachuBets,bc where does uss get its money from? fifa. it derives the majority of its money from the intl side. ticket and merch sales are a piss in the toilet for revenue so it really doesnt matter than usw brings more money in than usm domestically. the money is n overtime there.
PikachuBets,lol can this guy suck himself off any worse right now?? tweeted 1930 et when chw was +170 for 6 hours. but of course he caught the play at day high of +190! what a horrible attention whore. hey did you get back all those accts you torched 2 weeks ago yet?
PikachuBets,then i also think rufus is afforded the leniency of n overtime understanding how his shitty tout setup works this whole 30- minutes on twitter a free throw er real releases sort of thing. sammie replies to everyone as if how he works should be common knowledge...when he is a nobody lol
PikachuBets,"ez-pz being a betting ""analyst.""  it is  like mad libs!

""[team] [closing line] vs. [team]. ## money on [team]. since [year] [team] is ##-## against the spread  at home on a b2b. ty [tout website] for data! read [shit capper's blog] for more inside edge on this game.""

 it is  that easy!"
PikachuBets,no one is making a living betting into the highest limits at efficiency let alone in nfl. also if i lived in europe i wouldn't use cris...i'd be matching on an exchange like mbook or one of the larger asian ones. staying on screen in america just isn't feasible due to scale
PikachuBets,understood. times change. as times change the way you evaluate things should change as well. if college players are no longer all primed to go nba then theres no point in saying wow they suck theyre n overtime nba-level lol. theyre n overtime trying to be. barking up the wrong tree man
adamchernoff,"well i think the intent of the conversation is getting a bit clouded now. it was never a doubt of seattle n overtime being a ""good"" team. the question was about seattle playing to an unsustainable level and being inflated in the betting market which by any #'s presented here they are."
adamchernoff,there is an nfl handicap this week that i am convinced went entirely unnoticed by the majority of bettors (including myself). occasionally happens with one that is so blatant but has a weird number that stops most from digging in. have n overtime heard a peep about it nor has it moved.
adamchernoff,n overtime too concerned about the qb spot. colts this year as a team rank bottom third of the league in most major categories in comparison tables. five wins by a combined 20 points as well. bettors love how smart the team works but overall 5-6 poor performances of 7 this year.
adamchernoff,step is to evaluate how the two teams playing make each other better or worse by multiplying the pass and rush factor by the yards per pass/rush gained. for example against oak hou is expected to increase 122 percent  from 7.80 ypp to 9.51. oak expectancy is just shy of season average.
adamchernoff,so in short. n overtime much in terms of  monday night football  results. it would have to be extreme or feature a key injury. but more movement would be likely off of a extreme cin result vs an extreme pit result just because of how the market will shape up next week.
adamchernoff,early in the week bookmakers will o free throw en restrict certain basic strategy legs and in turn cost you points. basic strategy legs also tease from the le assit impactful numbers which require the le assit amount of money to move onto a key number - in turn killing the teaser.
adamchernoff,tough call. but we are n overtime likely to see pi overturned very o free throw en this year especially in meaningful spots. its a new judgement call made ontop of a missed judgement call and over turning a call requires the ref to openly admit he/crew made a poor judgement initially.
adamchernoff,it is a good stat find but i feel with almost all turnover st against the spread there are other big driving factors that make up for the difference which makes me question the correlation. just in this example alone each team but oakland had a dramatic roster change the improvement year.
adamchernoff,looks like you have a great blog. congr against the spread on publishing content for a decade. sorry you didnt enjoy my two articles. youd be amazed how much a simple conce point  (but low sell high) is misunderstood by many bettors and the relation to a real life example helped them...
adamchernoff,"perce point ion of results today factor into the prices (case and point with ind) but here is what i would anticipate for divisional weekend barring any blowouts:

ne -6 vs bal
ne -6 vs lac

no -8.5 vs dal
no -10.5 vs phi

lar -5.5 vs chi
lar -7 vs dal"
adamchernoff,i have a feeling i will. i have a long list of beers to buy/beers offered to me in australia. never heard a bad thing said about it and all of my followers from australia have been great for years. very much looking forward to a long overdue first visit in 2019.
adamchernoff,thank you to everyone for helping the simple handicap cross the 50000 download mark on itunes in 75 days. it is n overtime a big number compared to other great shows but committing to an idea every morning and seeing the audience continue to grow is amazing. cheers to all listeners !
adamchernoff,"a nice 2-0 sunday with tampa bay carolina over 54 1/2  la chargers pk both cashing in for my weekly blog on  a return of +2.10x profit.

my nfl record this season is now 9-3 +8.92x profit.

thanks for all of those who take the time to read and listen each week."
adamchernoff,youre right the wind looks strong it is the downside. in years p assit i would have bought into the hype of the trend. this year my focus is on field and the markets. the advantages both offences have in this game is too strong to disregard. im sticking with my over.
Ccon8181,their regular odds show -1 1st half and -1.5 full game. obviously they could have moved since you posted. just curious if the 10k guarantee is based off standard lines or makeshi free throw  odds at poor prices. thanks for posting. good o point ion to have if based on market price
Ccon8181,ive bet at south point on a few occasions. its just a little out of the way. where if im at the strip i can hit cg mgm and stations in the amount of time to get to sp. th against the spread why i was curious about their app and limits.
kellyinvegas,kevin has been hating on me for months. its kinda creepy at this point. i spend about 20 hours a week handicapping games. ive learned to focus on what i can. the mac is n overtime one of those things. use a few guys for power ratings as ive stayed many times.
ToddFuhrman,"betting on sports will...

- teach you money management
- force you to control  years old you are emotions
- educate you on probability
- hone  years old you are research skills and reading comprehension
- make you question the meaning of life

see generally speaking sports betting is a good thing"
12Xpert,in the us origins of bookmaking have o free throw en been tied up with crime and corru point ion hence tax and regulation doesn't really come into it. perhaps given the mafia involvement in the early days this is where the sense of duty (to hono you are action) arises from.
12Xpert,only explanation i have that a large sample would n overtime be in line with clvh is if pinny was intentionally biasing the market to mop up mug money allowing sharps to have a share of it because overall  it is  more profitable like that and the sharps are finding the value.
12Xpert,"i suppose i could feel some guilt for getting punters' accounts closed. however i'd say 3 things. 1) they'll ban you for being a 'winner' whatever  years old you are system so you'll need to find those ""ways"". 2) if you're good enough to beat sharp books then bet at those instead."
12Xpert,"most punters  daily fantasy sports  get variance and most of the ones that do can't handle it.

 it is  a funny thing. the biggest addiction humans have is uncertainty; it is also the thing most easily and frequently misunderstood. we crave to control it yet when we fail come back for more."
12Xpert,i can assure you that tipsters this side of the pond are just as useless. perhaps the only difference is that a greater proportion in the us know they are useless and cheat whilst in the eu many are still deluded into believing they have the slightest idea what they are doing.
12Xpert,i'm a bayesian ske point ic. when someone presents evidence for me to update my priors i update my priors. for example you encouraged me to look at the idea of a skewed distribution for a bettor's expected bet-rois. it is a good idea. i looked but so far didn't find evidence.
12Xpert,years old you are customer care is still n overtime fit for purpose. have asked repeatedly for  years old you are affiliate team to reply to me regarding non payment of affiliate revenue. still silence on all fronts. how long will it take? or should i just expect to be ignored forever?
12Xpert,you could test it but my hunch is no. taking a market average for football failed miserably. i think the reason is probably because so free throw  books systematically bias their odds so the average will be systematically biased too i.e. errors will n overtime cancel out to leave a wise number.
12Xpert,"it is  been there a number of years yes admittedly n overtime in the beginning. regardless as i set out in the book there is more to gambling than making a profit. ""stupidity"" was used in the context of this conversation. i actually  daily fantasy sports  think anyone who gambles is stupid."
12Xpert,im n overtime asking him to admit its pants. im n overtime even arguing that it is pants. im asking how he knows its n overtime and all hes come up with so far is its only profit that matters. that position needs calling out so others dont make the same mistake.
12Xpert,or they are for players who are willing to put in the work to disguise their so free throw book +ev. i just  daily fantasy sports  see what  years old you are problem is here. of course if you  daily fantasy sports  like it there is nothing forcing you to follow me.
12Xpert,to be fair  has been decent beyond other bookie ceos in reaching out to his customer base. but  it is  tinged with what he and his team did to his affiliate prog (there was no need for it). he will have done very nicely from the pokerstars buyout who probably drove it.
12Xpert,equally maddening is spending half  years old you are working life referring thousands of customers to a brand which then pays you a living only to be told out of the blue that  years old you are account is being terminated with immediate effect because they reserve the right to do that.

mschwimer,no. n overtime at all. want to be clear. o you are record since we started selling picks is downright embarrassing. no one at  is happy with the results. being +6 units in 600ish plays is terrible. but that is completely s expected points added rate from providing financial value to subscribers.
mschwimer,meant. point. great correction. did you stop getting the daily emails when picks were in a free throw er that point? i hadnt noticed you unsubscribe to the picks emails? also i take back that you watched like i hawk. i said that knowing you scrap o you are site. my bad.
mschwimer,n overtime disparaging  at all. i have said multiple times that they are the sharpest group around. have nothing bad to say about ed and the others their. they called us out. i then offered +230 and o you are payment up front. then they went silent. th against the spread all.
mschwimer,that literally makes no sense at all.  if the market does n overtime believe we have an edge that means the lines wont move.  if the lines wont move the majority of o you are subs will be able to bet at o you are number.  do you disagree with this comment?
mschwimer,if you dont think we will win give me one logical reason you wouldnt sign up for the 4 week package. zero ncaa basketball. $900 for  200+ recs. if we lose you get $2000 back (including fee). why on earth wouldnt you do this unless you dont believe a thing you say?
mschwimer,my bad.  certainly do n overtime want to be misleading in any way shape or form.  when someone registers on o you are website to get free picks on thursday and to see o you are track record.  all for free.  what do i call that person if n overtime a subscriber?
mschwimer,if you think closing line value matters then you should absolutely sign up for o you are service and n overtime take a single pick. if you are right you get 10k. when you are wrong you lose 3k. seriously why on earth wouldnt you do this if you believe in clv
mschwimer,he wasnt even a rule 5 pick! i talked to several organizations when they asked my opinion on who they should select. grullon was always in the top couple picks for me. previous year fran million reyes was my top choice.  o you are model is incredible for undervalued rule 5 players.
RufusPeabody,i wrote down my number the books price and an abbr expected value for the book. then spent until midnight going from book to book and betting them for anywhere from $50 to $300. mgm always had the best underdog moneylines. luckys (run by  back then) had the best 1h/1qs. (2/3)
RufusPeabody,honestly i  daily fantasy sports  know the endgame for me. but  it is  100 percent  n overtime selling picks. i've turned down 7 figure offers to sell. having a media profile has helped me grow my network which has led to some business opportunities and it makes hiring easier as well.
RufusPeabody,"scenario 3: georgia loses one more game in the regular season but wins the sec championship game. this one is a virtual coin flip. we would still give an edge to an sec west champ that runs the table before losing to uga.

scenario likelihood: 5.1 percent 
playoff prob: 45.9 percent"
RufusPeabody,heres my point: what are the chances these guys would have gone back and asked for the ticket to be paid as straight bets had one of the two won? and what are chances ticket writer pays it? this law allows books to freeroll themselves on correlated parlays they book. unethical!
RufusPeabody,congr against the spread james on one helluva run! you may n overtime have the  record but i'd make you a sizable favorite over  you made us pro bettors seem smart by association. on top of that you handled yourself with class  were graceful in defeat.  now when's the strip club?
RufusPeabody,if the process of prepping for and betting baseball feels like an obligation i'm n overtime going to do it (despite the fact that  it is  an even-numbered year). i have so many other things in my life i'm juggling with the podc assit nonprofit golf  another project in the works.
SportsCheetah,we discussed o you are general approach during bowl season and discuss variance and other quantifiable (or not) factors among other things for the first 30 mins. then we break down each bowl through christmas in de point h. its long but hit that 1.5x or 2x and fire it up.
SportsCheetah,dru brown is injured but starting? i have some +8/7.5 like everybody else but the entire offseason they said brown was better now but they may just go with freshaman anyway etc etc and weve seen sanders make a plethora of mistakes. ill be team island play back at the bottom.
SportsCheetah,embarrassing th against the spread all you tweeted about then i do well and you literally have nothing else to say. what a life you lead. i love a good troller out there but i check out  years old you are feed and mercy this is just sad man. get better.
SportsCheetah,nop o35.5 -110 - deep enough to deal with the zion injury for 6-8 weeks (especially if nicol melli is the next arvydas sabonis). zion wins roy anyway. jrue/lonzo is the best defensive backcourt in the nba. brandon ingram is good at basketball. josh hart 6th man. i'm a lakers fan
SportsCheetah,mia o43.5 -120 - they prob go as far as winslow/bam/herro take them + the potential midseason trade for lowry/cp3 with dragic everyone talks about. jimmy thrives as the guy and i think he'll enjoy the beach and keep quiet and ball. project 42.2 wins with no trade/e assit teams tanking
capjack2000,"yep. i know the cdc article was orchestrated to drive the agenda of lva too. its a convenient spin to put on a retirement story.

capjack2000,the market is like a giant model. treat it as a competing model. if the market is moving with  years old you are model th against the spread good. if its moving against  years old you are model you need more work. dont be fooled by small sample sizes. track everything.

capjack2000,by that you mean am i running thousands of simulations to reach a projection? i have used that approach. depends on the sport. for the nfl i  daily fantasy sports  even try to handicap. i just look for value. the market is too efficient to try and beat it via handicapping.
capjack2000,"dear anonymous (and likely made-up) mlb player:
people have been gambling on  years old you are sport long before you ever picked up  years old you are first bat. if you think that bookies started following you because paspa was repealed you are ill-informed and preaching a tired and disproven narrative."
capjack2000,"that is  unfortunate. while their tc have always stated that they reserve this right  it is  never a good thing to be viewed as taking something away. 

 it is  worth noting they make it clear the bettor is still welcome to bet everything else. most pros would gladly take that deal."
capjack2000,my issue is that 17000 people in 12 hours rushed to make a foolish bet. if they want to display their fandom there are better ways to go about it. im n overtime criticizing dk or even the bettors. we need education or these people are going headlong into a buzzsaw.
capjack2000,if you can circumvent it h against the spread off to you. the plug-in takes a snapsh overtime of all running processes on  years old you are computer. so using teamview gotomypc rdp wont fly either. youll need to code  years old you are own remote access so free throw ware.
capjack2000,when sportsbooks open for business they get a l overtime of people looking to bet who have never wagered before. those people are inevitably drawn to futures wagers. this skews the hold percent  for the first month or so. give harrahs another month and they'll be in line with the rest.
dinkinc,i g overtime through with work and decided to watch a few races from belmont.  bet $20 very small bet on the horse that broke down on the lead.  i have almost had enough. i dont think i can win and there is far too many things wrong with the sport
dinkinc,if you sell picks and  daily fantasy sports  work with  please unfollow me... i am n overtime a shill for  but i know those people bet and bet high... if you think you can get picks for free here that won't happen.. lot's of dogs and horse pictures is the plan..
dinkinc,3-0 with a push... i am going to stop six days early. recently had lunch with  and we discussed burnout .. we thought going out on top is the best way b4 a break.  it is  been an amazing month and an incredible year. for those who played please donate to
dinkinc,1-2 mlb... all three games changed in the l assit inning....0-1 nhl with an  overtime loss...pretty stressful day feeding   but we laughed a l overtime even  as i cursed at the t.v. and computer.... that girl has a future in eating contests a free throw er her run as ufc champion...

RASPicks,i just  daily fantasy sports  see a l overtime of difference between recruiting people to buy  years old you are picks and recruiting people to give you accounts.  you say you wouldn't be able to sleep at night if you had to tout but somehow this is worth multiple tweet support?
RASPicks,"most know that 99 percent  of touts present zero value but reasons most people should n overtime buy picks:
1) almost no one wins long term and unless you win yourself it is difficult to identify an actual winner.
2) requires time money management bankroll outs to justify cost of service."

VegasRefund,the int subtracted 1  point  from his total score.. which bumped him from 1st to 30th.. which was a $247k slide.. these single game slates the difference between 1st and 30th is decimal points since everyone has similar teams with a two team player pool + a top heavy prize structure.
suuma810,"example # 10001 on why long term getting the best of the number is so crucial.

i took bills 6.5 earlier this week but had market resistance. before kickoff bills moved to +7 -110ish at pinnacle.

i didnt lose because i didnt buy half a point i didnt beat the market."
suuma810,"years old you are 2019 #packers:

-average qb
-below-average defense

but 7-1 in close games with wins against trubisky (2x) kyle allen moore and haskins. cousins had his worst season game and gb won by 4 at home. lions killed themselves.

makes 11-3 and a sh overtime at the 1st seed."
suuma810,"jared goff passing grades in 2019:

under pressure: 54.8

he's always been bad under pressure but this year he declined vs. the blitz. probably a reflection of bad ol play.

the #ravens defense ranks 1st in dvoa since week 7 and blitzes about 50 percent +. good luck!"
suuma810,"you win a football game by scoring and teams who win in the playoffs score an average of 28.9 ppg while outscoring the other team by an average 14.6 - 8.5 in the first half and 13.9 - 8.8 in the second.

care about scoring n overtime about holding the ball."
suuma810,it is  n overtime rocket science.  daily fantasy sports  slam  years old you are rbs up the gut on 2nd  10 behind a bad ol when you - arguably - have the greatest receiving tandem in the league and one of  years old you are rbs is great in space. #vikings
ClevTA,in general i agree but it feels way more predictive when its a a really bad ol on the road and esp in primetime than any other time or location. i typically only care much if its an extreme situation on both ends of the line than just a slight advantage.
ClevTA,what are u talking about. theyll be favored in at le assit 8 of their final 9 gms and maybe all of them depending on pitt qb. they can easily win like 7-8 gms and finish with 10/11 gms. no team would start much better than 3-4:4-3 with this early sked
spanky,"any establishment should post prices and honor prices.  

if i walk into a supermarket to buy orange juice and sign reads ""on sale $1.99 limit 5.""  i walk up to check out with 5 bottles.  you think the manager is going to tell me - sorry sir limit is only 3?"
spanky,"online much better brock...

for one day i was treated like a king. i had a reserved line closed off just for me... th against the spread of course until i started winning and lines moved like crazy...  

joe the main guy is very nice...
rest of the staff is choppy..."
spanky,i disagree.  we have lots of pieces and we earn. its just hard to follow a service releasing so many plays. its a pain in the ass and a chore to do all the work and put in plays every day. and on top of all that work youre losing money.
spanky,"two differences.

1.) my protest goes a free throw er business practices of said business. their protest has nothing to do with how the chicken business is run

2.)my protest was just recording events that transpired never going out of my way. their protest is laying down on a dirty street"
spanky,in an efficient market you assume the closing line is the true line. so taking +5 is good on a game that closed +4. its probably n overtime enough to overcome the bookies vigorish but its a good start. had you gotten a +6 or better then youve entered $ land.
spanky,"so how do you achieve + closing line value? 

1.)team analysis
2.)market analysis

majority of my betting is #2. #2 has the worlds best cappers indirectly working for me. i never have to keep my model fresh or risk losing my edge.  i am also able to expertly bet multiple sports"
spanky,i consider myself an expert on all of the above skills. the number of bookmakers that i have encountered in my 20 year career that have cried bitched moaned  and screamed are countless.  the reasoning on why one is betting a number is pointless. write a bet and move the line
spanky,i didnt chose to be the central figure in  story. i told him he can leave my name out.ive been on twitter less than a year but been betting professionally for 20 years. i dont want nor need anyones admiration exce point  the industry insiders who knew me way be4 twitter
spanky,pay attention us bookmakers.  a guaranteed limit sheet is a basic necessity. you go into  and ask for a limit sheet they tell you there are no limits or it all depends. th against the spread bs. a bookmaker can always offer the customer more but should guarantee the house limit!
spanky,moving on air will never go away.  if an injury flashes i cant blame a bookmaker for moving on air.  what youre talking about is delayed confirmation where the bookmaker uses their sharp customers as a line service and doesnt even write a bet. i 100 percent  agree that is bullshit
spanky,i agree and apologize to any dressmakers that i have indirectly insulted.  i however completely disagree on  years old you are opinion of bookmakers.  a bookmaker is a very honorable cra free throw  that i deeply respect.  i have had the honor and privilege to meet some of the world's best.
spanky,behavior issues!?! with every shop that booted me all the supervisors took my side and blamed it on the hub which was remotely located. i was giving high tens and was a called a gentlemen! my recordings did n overtime alter change or violate the integrity of any game.  lame excuses!
spanky,i completely disagree that there is no point moaning about it... ive been booted from offshore sportsbooks on a weekly basis for the l assit 18 years and i never moaned about that. but the regulated us market is young and impressionable and im hoping my voice can make a difference
spanky,be easy brad. i lay -110.  bookmakers offer a price and i decide to acce point  it or pass... they theoretically have a mathematical advantage over me and if the info is used properly they can make more money that what i win.. that however requires talent which most dont possess..
spanky,scott please understand that a true professional can never document picks for fear of reverse engineering....   years old you are 60 percent  radio record is impressive.  im just some random twitter dude who claims to be a professional.  dont care if u believe me or not.  keep up the good work!

aluckyaday,no it is n overtime bonkers. you have to prove they have discriminated against  years old you are in an illegal way they  daily fantasy sports  have to tell you they are doing it! discrimination cases alway have to go to court or be settled out of court by mutual consent.
aluckyaday,that is n overtime how modern bookmaking works. they make more money booking only recreationals. why run a model that is less profitable? its n overtime that they are n overtime talented. it is just that talent is no longer needed. add it to the list of professions tech has changed.
aluckyaday,would certainly be the best o point ion for the country. when the two major parties have taken positions on the extremes anything other than a hung parliament to moderate would n overtime be good. doubt boris would see it that way though corbyn would probably n overtime mind too much.
aluckyaday,maybe it is different in the us but in the uk bets are contractual and are covered by contract law. if it is a consumer (betting is n overtime you business) to bookmaker bet it is also covered by consumer laws. i.e. the terms of the bet have to be fair.
aluckyaday,i think the issue with polling is you only get to see the headline figure n overtime the distribution of probabilities. is it short and fat or tall and thin. i'm guessing its the first and in a f point p system that equates to a large range of possible outcomes.
aluckyaday,does seem a little low guessing the data shows a big jump in recreational singles above that price. i think i heard he went to work for sportradar. maybe they have a social media policy. if i were them i would n overtime want him releasing the tit bits he did!
aluckyaday,just interested to know if she puts representing her constituents above the party line  that is  an honourable thing to do but if that is the case she should resign the whip and stand as an independent in the next election. if her constituents agree with her she will be reelected
aluckyaday,i think the fact that the sharp market is global makes it incredibly difficult. sharps  daily fantasy sports  worry too much about regulation . if you want to bet with pinnacle or in asia you can wherever you live. to survive they have to out pinnacle pinnacle which won't be easy!
aluckyaday,no they market their own products. most soccer teams now have some sort of bookmaker sponsorship. either in the stadium or on the shirts. tv advertising around live sport was solely bookmakers. its g overtime so bad they have had to bring in a whistle to whistle ban on bookmaker ads!
aluckyaday,you can mitigate the risk of bigger price bets by staking correctly. value is value  whatever the price. if you are betting for entertainment then  years old you are strategy is fine the utility of a winner is important but for maximum profit bigger value can be found at bigger prices
aluckyaday,the margin on their products is a l overtime smaller than most other products that can be detrimental to  years old you are health purchased with disposable income. i'd go even further gambling is only detrimental to  years old you are health if abused other things freely available are always detrimental.
aluckyaday,"i think american pros may find that as more books ado point  a european model he will find it more and more difficult to make his plays that target public biases. the value will be there for recreational players but n overtime for ""pros"" as books restrict rather than move lines."
aluckyaday,i  daily fantasy sports  think that is correct. they are writing in english n overtime latin. in english unlike latin correct grammar is to have an article before a noun phrases. magna carta is a noun phrase and should therefor be preceded by a article when referring to it in english.
aluckyaday,yes. the super contest lines are very early lines. as picks  daily fantasy sports  have to be submitted until 11am on saturday there is plenty of opportunity for contestants to take advantage of line movement but it is the same for everybody so n overtime really an advantage in the contest.
aluckyaday,it comes down to the usual problem. when estimating you can only look at averages. using a 100 percent  book individual deviations from that average will appear as random noise. but they are n overtime random if the bookmaker is applying them systematically based on variables you do n overtime know.
aluckyaday,"it looks non bonus related restrictions like these terms are are being investigated. ""weve opened a new line of enquiry to look further into obstacles that people face when they try to withdraw their money a free throw er gaming or betting online (whether as part of a promotion or not)."""
aluckyaday,yes but i would think (guessing) the majority that bet on horse racing are casual bettors (more than 30 percent  anyway!) betting on a saturday and big meetings rather than the ones that bet most day. need a friendly book to give you real figures. what percentage bet horses most days?
theFirmAISports,haha yeah it seemed fishy when we saw this line too. definitely did a double check on the numbers feeding the models but logic and numbers both checked out. even tho packers tried to hand the vikes the win with all the turnovers it was still easy money l assit night.

EdMillerPoker,"if they score to go into hal free throw ime tied they're a favorite to win the game n overtime 46 percent .

have no idea what ""current chance to win""  percent  is supposed to represent.

the chance of winning down 13-17 (""if kick  field goal "") is also way off."
EdMillerPoker,you know the craziest thing about this story is this guy was literally having a punt as they say on his favorite team and player. its the squarest action there is. if ever you were gonna shake  years old you are head and pay one youd think it would be that.
EdMillerPoker,i have n overtime i find his twitter so insufferable that i cant psych myself up for the long version. ill admit that ive had enough pushback on this guy that its entirely possible im just missing the point. maybe ill suck it up and give one podc assit a chance.
EdMillerPoker,o you are team scouts the games and follows news to try to get the info as f assit as possible. then we have estimates for the impact of the injury and move o you are model inputs appropriately. then if the market disagrees with us we can adjust as necessary.
EdMillerPoker,i complain about how media business models work these days but one thing its great at is determining what things are interesting to people. why n overtime spend some time looking at sports media see which ways of looking at sports ca point ure attention and then build products around that.

nonrandomalpha,the chiefs and giants both didn't win the super bowl l assit year. are you suggesting their seasons were as equally unsuccessful?  team a took a season to move in the right direction team b the wrong direction. sb or bust is n overtime a fair assessment of a season's efficacy.
nonrandomalpha,"but you're right the efficacy of winston will be the biggest factor. dude can be a careless turnover machine. he's playing for a big contract this year -  let us  see if he's matured at all over the l assit 4 years. 

s expected points added rately i'll take saints under."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""o you are first priority was the defensive line.""

ah the half of the ball that matters less and the less important part of that half.

 it is  n overtime like russell wilson was there when carroll came in. carroll started in 2010 wilson was dra free throw ed in 2012."
LeeSharpeNFL,"this game is n overtime actually irrelevant for ten as i thought. this l assit line is incorrect.

if pit and ten both lose next two it may n overtime be ten as this says. it could be cle or oak sneaking in as the 6th seed. so ten does care."
LeeSharpeNFL,"saddened but unsurprised by this poll's outcome.

we have no way to measure it directly obviously but there's no evidence to my knowledge that it can be s expected points added rated from variance.

also as  pointed out players subject to this likely  daily fantasy sports  make it to the nfl."
LeeSharpeNFL,he reminds me most of jay cutler. i think he's someone you can win with if you have enough supporting pieces but you're also going to have to live though games he throws away due to turnovers. that can be a problem in a sport with a single elimination playoff format.
LeeSharpeNFL,"years old you are mitch trubisky stat of the day:

mitch trubisky when throwing passes to targets beyond the first down marker has the lowest completion percentage over expectation (cpoe) at -7.7 percent .

 that is  33rd out of 33 qbs with at le assit 100 passing attem points  in 2019."
LeeSharpeNFL,books try to model where the market will be on a game. usually they're right (within a tolerance) and only move the line a little. sometimes when they get too much (for their risk tolerance) action on one side they correct and adjust the line. they're n overtime perfect modelers either.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the problem with these arguments is constant goalpost shi free throw ing. pbwr/prwr for examine can say if you're winning the line of scrimmage. if a 4th down model incorporated those a different issue is raised instead.

at some point you have to acknowledge numbers outweigh  years old you are gut."
LeeSharpeNFL,i think a l overtime depends on what you're trying to use this measure to show. if you control for offensive strength this is measuring luck effectively much like fumble recoveries. i think  that is  valuable though s expected points added rates signal from noise by identifying noise rather than signal.
LeeSharpeNFL,"scheduling quirk: the nfl is generally good about making sure a team playing a road  thursday night football  game has a home game the sunday before.

the two exce point ions: both were pit who was forced to play two road games in 5 days (in 2013 and again in 2016)."
LeeSharpeNFL,"literally every seahawks game:

1. seahawks run too much and make other bad decisions
2.  it is  a one score game that stresses seahawks fans out
3. russell wilson pulls some absurd heroics to bails them out
4. the seahawks coaching staff believes #1 was the key to success
5. repeat"
whale_capper,i remember 2015 well there was huge resistance to give the dubs due credit because they didnt have to beat the spurs and they cavs were the walking wounded... same thing is happening now and its driven by people who only pay attention during the finals from what i can tell
AndyMSFW,"a big part of what made the bears a great team l assit year was incredible turnover luck.  now imagine that kind of luck bestowed on a team with a hof coach/qb combo in a shitty division. 

miami becomes the first team to ever finish 16 games back in their division."
AndyMSFW,"9 days til the nfl kicks off!

2. i feel bad for canada because they really had their hopes up.  they g overtime a title though.
3. anytime you can get away from westbrook  it is  a good idea.
4. nba might be pretty competitive"
AndyMSFW,learned some lessons two weeks ago betting some golf.  match-ups broke even but betting like a dozen top20 props turned out to be a little too aggressive and went pretty fucking poorly.  working out how to go a free throw er quail hollow as we speak.  #gol free throw alk #deadheatrules
JoeyKnish22,i thought the 2nd episode was solid here. especially the part talking about credit relationships etc. built a l overtime of my connections through trust ppl knowing if they work with me theyre gonna get paid and vice versa. its still a niche industry word of mouth goes a long way.
JoeyKnish22,"if youre an inbreed and like nascar like my peasant friend  he thinks larson is gonna win this weekend. and recommends +800 or better. 

i think he has no sh overtime and no non championship contending driver has ever won the l assit playoff race. gl if you tail that idiot."
JoeyKnish22,im sure they just took a mass data scrape so a l overtime of accounts in that mix that were betting small/dormant/ran out of funds. gambling twitter sometimes clouds this perce point ion but the v assit majority of any sportsbook accounts are gonna be under 1k betting small and losing.
LockyLockerson,"one thing that always bugged me about the d expected points added rted... no one on the police could figure out dicaprio was the undercover despite the fact that the o point ions were:
--crime boss
--lifetime criminal
--lifetime criminal #2
--lifetime criminal #3
--new guy who just g overtime there"
LockyLockerson,when the market model and the spread differed by 3 or more points that was a profitable bet l assit year.  that doesn't beat it will be profitable this year but just interesting to note.  l assit night the clippers was off by 3+ points (probably because of the george injury)
LockyLockerson,with clippers-lakers even weirder because no real home-court advantage right? and on a neutral again using same conce point  it would be pk or clippers -1 maybe.  and  it is  lakers -3.5 with no george.  is that too much? right amount? never seen him with this team so tough to know.
LockyLockerson,"this is going to be the start of the busiest 7-10 days of football preview content.  the l assit big push for every site/person to get their stuff out.  just remember through all the excitement that most ""cases"" for win totals are based on things that  daily fantasy sports  actually matter."
LockyLockerson,"there is a market at bookmaker for whether clemson and alabama will meet in the title game with the ""no"" currently -300.  normally this kind of thing would be a little easier to price but we very frequently see the seeding of playoff teams n overtime make a ton of sense."
LockyLockerson,by the way this isn't me locking in a position fading clemson or anything in fact i have the largest gap in win projections in any conference from 1st to 2nd with them and...another team.  they have the biggest difference to 2nd in their conference.  but i'm just asking the ?
LockyLockerson,even if it gets cancelled i'm putting out all the stuff i have.  angles history etc.  we might as well read about previous ncaa tournaments if we  daily fantasy sports  have one this year.  (which i think is still far-fetched we probably just have it in different locations with no fans).
LockyLockerson,"there are still so many roster things to get ironed out for all teams that i can't really give you any type of detailed projection right now.  too many moving parts.  but all i can say is if the previous number was ""correct"" any movement is n overtime rooted in logic."
DannyParkins,the dolphins might n overtime even end up with their own pick being top 5 a free throw er it seemed like a lock to be 1st overall. and they have the steelers and texans 1st round picks which likely will both be in the 20s. tough times for the tank.
DannyParkins,i think mitchs absolute ceiling this year is around 4500 yards and 40 touchdowns which in this nfl might n overtime be good enough to win mvp. but if it happens on a 13 or 14 win team? it could happen. ill take my chances at 10k with $50 at 200:1.
DannyParkins,looks like security walked that fan in the blue shirt off courtside a free throw er replay showed he pushed kyle lowry when he dove into the se against the spread next to him. jvg oddly defended the guy who shoved him with wh against the spread he supposed to do?
DannyParkins,because the v assit majority of the time the ratings on this station like any local sports station or frankly station in general are going to be minimal so what you can charge for advertising is minimal. the money comes from the subscri point ion fees monthly being bundled with cable.
DannyParkins,one month ago my wife went to the hospital with complications during pregnancy. owen was born january 17th at 31 weeks 4 days  weve been in the nicu til today. wife  baby are doing great  were thankful to everyone at prentice o you are friends  family. were thrilled to be home.
Gingfacekillah,also as an addendum to the announcement i'll be including in this book direct links so that readers can download my spreadsheet models and follow along or tweak them on their own. this on its own i think makes the book an incredible value for those wanting to learn by example.
Gingfacekillah,we can't know for sure but this game is about pricing uncertainty. i'd seriously consider firing on this - but i'll wait to see if the market irrationally drives the line in o you are favo you are - since recency bias is the rationale behind this in the first place.
Gingfacekillah,mentions this in sharper.  years old you are edge if its real will eventually be swallowed up by the market as it moves towards higher levels of relative efficiency.  it is  a game of outrun.  moneyline is worth learning if you're serious about modelling  years old you are way to victory.
logan_matthews9,true. but if you are only using one book at the same time daily i think youd cut down on a l overtime of the legwork. personally if i was getting down 100+ bets a day i would just code a b overtime or pay someone to make one for me
logan_matthews9,the only adjustment i made was giving less weight to p assit performances on the course. probably why im n overtime as high on xander rahm and woodland. also noteworthy even n overtime giving that as much weight dj is still my favorite (who has played this course very well historically)
logan_matthews9,hes tucked the wingers in more - early on he basically had them put their heels on the touch line and try and go 1v1. he realized we dont have anyone sans pulisic who is good enough to do that so hes tried to get them more connected to the fbs.
logan_matthews9,i really held off as long as i could but i cant pass up navy/af at 44. ive g overtime it in the 50s and cant just say well its a armed forces game anymore. went kinda big too im n overtime sure itll go lower (which is already below market).
logan_matthews9,the us has clearly shown they like him and think he has a bright future - i dont think berhalter needs to call up every 17 year old who has a high ceiling and let him know hes a fan th against the spread the whole point of youth national teams
logan_matthews9,*whispers* you can make some money betting on cincinnati because of st against the spread like this. they actually arent that bad now that everyone is back. ive hit them two straight weeks and did again for tomorrow. their xg gd is also significantly better. columbus is a worse team imo

PikachuBets,"""i lost the majority of my outs due to winning too much""

just noticed this. he had the balls to mass dm this around when this fool was posting bovada bet slips regularly a year ago on reddit. best pa is someone fell for it and are now down millions looooooooooooooooooooooooool"
PikachuBets,"done. 35u on 1u base. but you are cucking already. now propose a third party arbitrator for us and dont make it some scum friend of yours.

also classic too busy excuse. can host 30- minutes periscopes cant send some twitter replies to work out a deal. kk np ill bite"
PikachuBets,of course it is the fault of the 18-year-old for n overtime digging thru bls statistics and labor econ papers before making a life decision! do you hear yourself? some 18-yos are still trying to figure out how to put on a condom correctly lets be reasonable about who to blame
adamchernoff,the comment in the video was in reference to their defensive performance specifically within the secondary n overtime the team as a whole. the 2+ minutes in the video was discussing the ne off against the ten def/secondary and how mia/cin are the only two teams that rank worse for ne.
adamchernoff,youre sp overtime on. unfortunately for the 85 percent  of customers looking at $115 to win $100 instead of $120 to win $100 vs receiving say vs $50 free play is a waste and o free throw en considered insulting. o free throw en viewed as a much cheaper/worse offer too.
adamchernoff,to finish this up. nfl network espn and fox shows/clips all have lamar mvp debates full-bore today. he is now co-favourite to win in the markets. christ! nine games ago there were cries to bench him for flacco a free throw er gus bradley embarrassed harbaugh in the wild card game...
adamchernoff,"the recreational narratives are endless on this game...

west co assit team travelling e assit for early start
cba implemented 9 years ago limiting practice
extra rest vs short rest
california team playing outside in october
let down for oak off a big win
let down for gb off a comeback"
adamchernoff,"thinking in risk/outcome becomes more problematic when you consider that the difference between odds of (-200 / 1.50) and (-215 / 1.465) is the same as the difference between odds of ( expected value / 2.00) and (+109 / 2.09). many recreational bettors will say ""9 cents"" equating it to money"
adamchernoff,"my big bet of the  college basketball  season cashes in on new mexico +7 for members of the simple handicap slack channel. nice win for all. 

looking ahead to two more first round wagers today and tomorrow. if you are n overtime yet a member you can join the channel here:"
adamchernoff,yeah they are both great have been in the industry longer than i have and without a doubt know more. n overtime trying to be anyone with my comment just sharing a perspective from an area in the industry i have been very involved with for the p assit half decade.
adamchernoff,for me this is a classic push/pull game. minnesota has a l overtime of cumulative support that is continuing to build - going back weeks now - that is holding the price up. they have an advantage throwing the ball downfield as they do against most opponents otherwise its a mismatch.
Ccon8181,ive been in my fair share of bad be against the spread involving the #browns .. but if you had #browns +6 1st half th against the spread just brutal!! yikes. sad part is its n overtime even top 5 worst browns be against the spread over l assit 5 seasons
kellyinvegas,at +10 this starts to classify as an overreaction in the marketplace. i wasnt going to get involved but this is so much like the lions on thanksgiving its n overtime even funny. nevada has played on this turf. the altitude may affect this ohio team and leave that backdoor open.
ToddFuhrman,ha thanks plus...if there's one thing you guys as o you are loyal listeners have come to expect  it is  honesty from us.  offseason  podcast will delve into a few other topics for sure but the entire space has turned into social proofing like everything else and that thought scares me
ToddFuhrman,"never been compared to a f assit food worker before so kudos for that. 

having grown up working in a h overtime dog stand it was slightly easier to make a chicago style dog when it was explicitly ordered from me as such conpared to predicting a sb winner in august"
ToddFuhrman,its all relative and purely price drive . for example the browns you could like at 25-1 but at 14-1 stock becomes overvalued. in the market i actually agree with the sentiment since you can get in cheap then momentum creates value to sell sports a bit different in that regard
ToddFuhrman,"was told a great story years ago...

the best way to tell the difference between poker players fantasy players and sports bettors all in a group at a bar?

sports bettors pick up the entire tab

fantasy players ask to split the tab

poker players ask you to pay the tab"
TheCousinSal,hmm...i always like basing the season on the actual season and n overtime a single weekend in march. maybe th against the spread why i dont have a vote. gianniss defensive numbers are second to none.  actually second to anthony davis - the other reason the lakers are where they are.
12Xpert,the odds in these analyses are fair closing lines so evidently the approach is beating them. the question is whether  it is  systematic (a real bias/inefficiency) or whether  it is  just random. i'm still in favo you are of the former but admit if  it is  real  it is  very weak.
12Xpert,"here's a review i found probably n overtime what you had in mind:
.
i still struggling to understand the conce point . to me it seems like a convoluted form of arbitrage. but surely the non pro punters are just going to get banned by their bookmakers in the end."
12Xpert,sorry jeff but  that is  just crap. if you hate his politics deconstruct them. i imagine his children wouldn't like seeing this.  it is  this sort of shit endlessly filling social media that slow divides a nation. why  daily fantasy sports  you give him a hug instead of wishing he died.
12Xpert,ok so finally i've managed to create what you see i.e. more 12 from 34 than binomial would predict. we just need a bigger sample of bets. this time i used 146 which gives 113 possible 34-bet sequences. binomial would predict on average we'd see 1 with 12 or fewer wins.
12Xpert,that depends on the performances. we are back to p-values again. ultimately you will never know for sure if a tipster is skilled or even was skilled and is no more. i think you need to apply a scatter gun approach in looking for numerous signals that are indicative of skill.
12Xpert,right. instead of counting wins i'm calculating returns and comparing them to those predicted. it amounts to the same thing really. but since  years old you are bet price / closing price provides a useful numerical yardstick to help bettors understand this in term of returns i do it like this
12Xpert,n overtime if i can get my excel formulae working as i want. but certainly will make results collection longer that before so i kinda  daily fantasy sports  want to be doing it late sunday night anymore i always hated it anyway. hopefully long term users will be able to accommodate.
12Xpert,while tipsters like you exist punters will never learn anything. maybe you're right their too lazy to bother. but  daily fantasy sports  pretend you're somehow holier than thou because i'm affiliate scum and you offer winners. nearly all of  years old you are like are f....g useless and are tossing coins.
12Xpert,i'm thinking of reducing the main leagues football data bookmakers for 1x2 odds to just two: bet365 and pinnacle. is there any reason why i shouldn't do this? in return i am thinking of adding bet365 and pinnacle over under and asian odds (in addition to max/avg). would this be useful?

mschwimer,this is exactly correct!  that is what makes us completely different than other touts.  with other touts a subscriber loses and th against the spread it.  with o you are service we will pay you if o you are picks can't beat the market.  therefore providing the subscriber with financial value.
mschwimer,question to twittersphere. has a nfl team ever gone 6-0 in their division and n overtime win their division? i think the browns have a realistic sh overtime at doing this. 2 vs. bengals. 2 vs. steelers. ravens at home. but will probably be 2-5 a free throw er new england.
mschwimer,i think its a great suggestion. adds a l overtime more manual work on o you are end but i will strongly consider it. can tell you it wont happen quickly but maybe make it a s expected points added rate package in the near future. thanks again for the suggestion!
mschwimer,"1. agree. those picks were poop.
2. disagree with model being broken.
we put all o you are plays on . free for everyone.  started 6 weeks ago. if you put $1000 on every recommended play you would be up $34860. tmk the best in the world during that time frame."
RufusPeabody,"so he has ""potential"" in the traditional sense. but i'd take a minshew arm with great decision-making and ability to read defenses + make progressions over a great arm who's average at the other skills. imo (which may be worth nothing) plus arm strength is just a ""nice to have"""

RufusPeabody,ive just never thought in terms of units since im n overtime trying to communicate my record to the masses. in general i am betting whatever i can get down on all but big market stuff where ill cap things around a certain amount bc i dont want ginormous swings
RufusPeabody,its simple: counting cards even as a team the way the mit team did it is n overtime illegal. its just not. casinos are private property and can tell people they are no longer welcome to play. but its n overtime illegal unless youre using electronics or something to aid
RufusPeabody,i had a dream l assit night where my mlb model was somehow spitting out the output of a different day's mlb games but i didn't realize... yet i g overtime lucky and g overtime 20c of closing line value on a game. (this probably means i need a vacation)
RufusPeabody,people seem to be taking this at face value. the line move info is actually publicly available. schwimer promised to release the line move report but never has. why not? makes you wonder... my hunch? this is just pr on his part to save face. willing to be proven wrong.
SportsCheetah,then why was utah ranked ahead of them in this p assit ranking? they're both going to add a top-30 win. for whatever reason they haven't given b12 respect to this point n overtime sure why it would change much upon both winning conf title and adding another quality win.
SportsCheetah,"lol if anybody knows this off the top of their head i will bequeath the bankroll to you in my will:

james harden and russell westbrook are the first pair of teammates to have a 55-point game and a triple-double in the same game since reggie miller and _______________ who?"
capjack2000,"today's betting public is n overtime price sensitive. they  daily fantasy sports  recognize the value of reduced juice. sharps do however. 

as a result promos like these attract more sharp money than public money.

we need to educate the public on price sensitivity if these promos are going to last."
capjack2000,"promotional money in nj inflates handle and deflates revenue. as i understand it a player who receives $100 match for their $100 deposit and wagers $200 but loses counts as $200 in handle but only $100 in revenue for the book.

suuma810,dont have exact #s for nfl. but literally every bookmaker i listen to on podc assits or interviews says that winning longterm is all about beating the closing line. example  monday night football : if you took u42.5 off the opener you had a winner by beating the closing line.
ClevTA,i just dont recall any precedent in the p assit where a team goes on the road to a top 10-15 team wins ugly and drops. winning ugly by 1 at michigan has never been treated the same as beating northwestern by 1 for example. th against the spread all
CizzlingSports,"so for example a $300-betting 17-week 02 package sub entered 10/12  down -$1767.00 overall. the sub had a $12210.00 bankroll le free throw . the sub needed that entire remaining bankroll to bet on 10/12.

if that turned out to be a big loosing day well you get the picture"
CizzlingSports,"um assuming all bets at -110 (they're not) actually looks like:

sub buying five 1-week packages is up  1u a free throw er fees ($253)  needed an $18098 roll

sub buying two 4-week packages is down -$359.00 a free throw er fees  needed an $18648 roll

spanky,"given the language is so ambiguous you must look at the houses debate on the bill. congressman emanuel celler chairman of the house judiciary committee stated ""bill only gets a free throw er the bookmaker the gambler who makes it his business to take bets or to lay off bets"
spanky,when did i ever say i was an originator (see below).  truth is better than anything. the real truth is i've made enough money doing this to l assit me many lifetimes.  i'll still stay hungry to stay on top of my game.  you keep hatin and i'll keep earnin
spanky,im all for players rights but restricting a bookmakers ability to move his numbers isint right.  some of the worlds best bookmakers wont move their line on a 100k bet but will move it hard on a 1k bet depending on who bet it.  th against the spread the art.
spanky,i never directly take money from bettors.  however given this is a zero sum game i use technical analysis and line movement as a guide to make many of my bets.  i have more outs than anyone i have the best information and the fastest technology. originating is way overvalued.
spanky,the sad part is i was born and raised in jersey city nj.  woulda been cool to bring things full circle and enter the  sports betting contest in the town i grew up in.  ahh and so it goes.   onwards and upwards.  good luck to all entrants and have fun!
spanky,nice one.what i meant to say was todays losers could very well be tommorows winners. i myself was a losing player before figuring it all out.  the crappy part is once you figure it out the winning becomes the easy part. finding bookmakers who will book you becomes the challenge
spanky,this is great.  heres some advice for you media guys. keep talking about my business and making monopoly money picks and commenting on what the sharps are on.  you are essentially speculating on what i do day in and day out..i control the us sports market. youre n overtime gamblers
spanky,i feel you bro but lets keep it real. these guys are real bettors.the tout gig is a side gig.  they somehow are able to manage both.  i personally could never do it.  has his releases down to a timed science which is impressive.  i have no idea how  releases
PlusEVAnalytics,golf capping looks fun but super intimidating. strokes gained is a nice idea but isnt it biased by strength of field? so now i have to take each players history and somehow convert it to what would have happened in this specific tournament on this specific course. n overtime easy!

aluckyaday,they may think that but it is n overtime a reality for most. try looking at the bigger picture. the job of the recreational book is to bring as much recreational money as possible in to the industry this will eventually filter through to the books where pros can bet.
aluckyaday,this all comes down to the flawed levy model. racing like all other sports should be selling its product directly n overtime relying on bookmakers to do it for them. if it is n overtime a strong enough product to stand on its own two feet then so be it.
aluckyaday,open a recruitment office in the university towns of regulated states. coming of age students sign up with every book and hand over the keys to you for a small percentage of volume. do you bit for society helping to fund their studies although they'd probably spend it on beer!
aluckyaday,personally i think asking for a particular language saying it is a must is usually only done by people who do n overtime understand what skills are required to make a good programmer advantageous maybe but a requirement? you are ruling out the v assit majority of great analytical minds
aluckyaday,tends to lack liquidity in all markets. well n overtime enough to get the kind of trading you want. that is the issue. liquidity in financial markets is n overtime created by speculation. it is created because of the underlying reason the market exists. speculation is just a by product.
aluckyaday,why should the government support racing rather than bookmakers? bookmakers will do what is best for their business n overtime racing. racing seems to think it has a right to be treated preferentially. it needs to stand on its own fo you are feet rather than expecting handouts from others.
aluckyaday,thanks for clearing that up. i guess that with any tout service where follower could have different entry points it is impossible to advise correct staking. in theory you should just need to show   years old you are estimate of the true probabilities and the clients work out the stakes.
aluckyaday,you have to remember these books have high acquisition and marketing costs. even if you are a small losing punter you are probably n overtime net profitable business for them. whether you lost is n overtime really relevant their calculated expectation on  years old you are bets are what matter.
aluckyaday,"they are but their is n overtime a single market. there are several different prices depending on the market place. because there is n overtime free movement of money across these markets and the terms/regulations of each market are different i think the conce point  of ""the market"" is flawed"
aluckyaday,that is because nobody can tell upfront what the charge is. some people get payed to play others they charge for the privilege. anyone can look at the ggy figure the gc publishes to see the average cost if they want. i doubt very much that would help problem gamblers!
aluckyaday,the market cap comes from the sports books of paddy power and betfair plus dk in the us n overtime the exchange. i monitor the betfair exchange every day (horse racing) and the early liquidity has declined significantly over the l assit 5 years. have you read the whole article?
aluckyaday,i think we have to rely on that fact that he is a scoundrel and just tells people what they want to hear to get votes. in reality he does n overtime want no deal and when it comes down to it i believe he won't do it! wishful thinking?
aluckyaday,there is n overtime enough data to say placing in the super contest is significant. survivorship bias. if everyone in the contest was making random picks someone will still win it. closing line value and if you can get on at the prices are the 2 things to look at.
aluckyaday,easy to use competitive so free throw  books should be able to achieve that assuming the tax burden is n overtime too great. in theory as pros do n overtime contribute to ggr and hence tax take forcing them to bet offshore should n overtime too much of an issue.
aluckyaday,is there n overtime a friendly bookmaker that would be willing to give you their demographic for regular horse racing punters so you can compare the 2. looking deeper there seems to be a significant bias towards regular horse racing punters but maybe that is who you want to represent?
aluckyaday,just been looking at oddsportal historical data myself and it seems to only store pinnacle prices to 2 decimal places. this may well explain the margin difference seen in shorter prices as anything under 2.0 should be 3 placed. how many decimals in  years old you are pinny data joseph?
aluckyaday,why would they stop him? unless the publicity of him giving it back easily would be detrimental. negative expected value winners are normally great publicity! in reality so free throw  books make their money from internet driven high volume low stake recreational bets. whales are probably n overtime a priority.
aluckyaday,this is actually one of the things the uk regulator actually did something about a free throw er similar problems here. bonus and cash funds must be ke point  s expected points added rate. bonus funds are wagered before cash. anything in cash funds can be withdrawn at any time.
joeytunes2,pretty proud of myself. i wanted georgia-11 opener. didnt think it would go higher. then all week it was getting pounded. i was waiting for the big correction. it never came. (tweeted fake line movement) i laid off it. was out of my range.  personally felt that was a mismatch.

EdMillerPoker,theres also a free rider problem with  years old you are argument. small states can get away with this sort of thinking but in doing so they are free riding on infrastructure that will built in the big states. if all states think this way the entire industry is crippled.
EdMillerPoker,i think dk is better positioned than anyone else to dominate the us market. but to go from better positioned to actual domination they have to meet a few core needs and do it well. i think they're a dog to do that so i guess i'd bet the field.

obviously they are individuals who  daily fantasy sports  speak with one voice but people of color know a l overtime more than me a white person. so if they tell me i'm saying something that does that i listen apologize and change."
LeeSharpeNFL,"people have no interest in being polite. and my block button has no patience for them.

yesterday someone replied to me saying ""can't believe you put x above y this is why you're a sportswriter without a blue checkmark.""

(the joke is on them i am n overtime a sportswriter.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"all of that said... there are times where books make off-market lines because their model shows those lines are more profitable for the book with parlays and the like.

can a bettor can predict when this is happening vs. a market move? maybe. but i'd rather try to predict games."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i did s(ydstogo)  s(yardline_100) and binned wp (0.2 0.8 middle).

did n overtime do play type was rewarding/punishing good decisions there but can see the argument the other way.

was also crediting them if they failed on 3rd down but went for it on 4th down and g overtime it."
LeeSharpeNFL,"kind of working on a hack to my season simulator a free throw er  asked if i could show ""bye probability leverage"" for upcoming games. i couldn't yet. hoping for next week though. this code was written a long time ago and is in desperate need of a refactor :p"
whale_capper,i believe what slightly limited embiid down the stretch this season was a knee injury sustained at the all-star game.... now that he's done growing i think you'll get a few (maybe 5) prime years out of him with the same kind of injury risk that comes with any 7-footer...

AndyMSFW,we joked on the podc assit about minshew-mania being over the top but also the detractors being a little too harsh.  he;s right in that zone that'll keep a game close every time.  so we decided to just tease the jaguars 12 times in a row to finish the year.
AndyMSFW,yeah  it is  a bit vague.  n overtime sure if she's referring to the fact that nba players take a bigger percentage of revenue or if she's taking a sh overtime at the wnba and owners.  either way they need stronger union leadership and some way to find some leverage.
JoeyKnish22,real talk. kelly gave up touting. i heard shes an actual degen. (legit bets n overtime just the media type that talks about betting) she works the proxy and media hustle. i have nothing against her. i made some jokes cause im boys with linde and i like off-color humor.
JoeyKnish22,was able to take care of my needs here appreciate all the interest. if you sent me a dm i read it n overtime ignoring you i just g overtime more response than i could individually respond to. i will keep the messages for potential future needs. thank you again.
JoeyKnish22,never understood this thought process either and a l overtime of people say it as if its a concrete certainty. the liquidity between pregame and live at almost every shop isnt even remotely close atm and i have a hard time seeing volume of small/casual bettors making up that delta
JoeyKnish22,lol in fairness the study is 14 years old. and tbh most of society willingly makes bad choices in the face of hard data that says they shouldnt on a regular basis (smoking drinking unhealthy food etc). the allure of winning and just fun in general i think drives most.
TheKostos,"i saw aj hinch's response to the cheating allegations and i'd like submit a revised edition:

""we are a bunch of cheating scumbags. we g overtime caught and we are sorry. we never would have beaten the 2017 yankees unless we weren't a bunch of cheating scumbags. we sincerely apologize"""
TheKostos,even more so than 49ers 39 giants 38 that game epitomized #theanatomyofacollapse. if like one of 15 different things had gone differently the packers win the super bowl. would have beaten the p against the spread like they did in regular season. unfathomable loss squarely on mmc n overtime bostick
LockyLockerson,"coming down the home stretch of ""widely-available  college football  things i bet"" in what has been a very ""meh"" season. still we go forward:

12p missouri +7 -115
12p nebraska +14
330p clemson -34
330p vanderbilt +10
430p wazzu -10.5
7p ole miss +21.5
730p baylor +10.5
8p ucla +21"
LockyLockerson,"i think you're mis-interpreting the influx of bets on simmons as something i'm diametrically opposed to.  in fact it was the just the entry point to have the conversation (since a l overtime of people are talking about it).  you  daily fantasy sports  need to ""sell"" me simmons at all."
LockyLockerson,im going to be working with a very simple hypothesis:  every nfl preseason game should actually be lined the same side and total.  attem points  to deviate from that are foolish and based on trends or things that arent actually proven.  at le assit th against the spread the theory.
DannyParkins,this is the silver lining people will talk themselves into... that now because the bulls didnt get lucky the rebuild is less likely to work so garpax will be gone quicker. problem is they have maximum job security and no one knows how they define success cuz it aint titles.
DannyParkins,"of course.  at 11:00 pm et and  will be in studio sometime a free throw er that. we begin with ""what do you want out of  years old you are ncaa tournament?"" because other than  years old you are team winning everyone seems to have a different answer. sirius 206."
DannyParkins,size of the fanbase? maybe slightly. but so many games are already on cable. its n overtime like theyre hard to find. think of it like this: would you rather share a large pizza with nbc and other teams or would you rather have a whole medium pizza to yourself?
DannyParkins,yes. th against the spread what im telling you. what free tv station is available to broadc assit 140+ cubs games that the cubs could own 100 percent ? espn makes the majority of its money from subscriber fees n overtime advertising. th against the spread where the money is.
DannyParkins,you already paid for the games on nbc chicago. and espn. and fs1 in the playoffs. exce point  the revenue from that was shared this goes to the team which will help them get more players. also more local sports media is a good thing for fans of local sports.
DannyParkins,new trend seems to be top button even when sitting which o free throw en shows tie out the bottom. joe buck had it that way during the super bowl. seems odd to me too but th against the spread how they suggested i do it for the final word.
Gingfacekillah,let us  try an example using the  estimated no-vig moneline pricing for tonight's  thursday night football  game. tbb: 3.51 car: 1.35. using the logarithmic vig removal method gets us: tbb: 26.92 percent  car: 73.08 percent . using the above posted regression that would give us a spread of car -7.24.
Gingfacekillah,found this one tough to forecast. gsw should take care of -10 against a 3 in 4 det team that maxed out its starters l assit night but with both teams on a b2b i'm n overtime sure if gsw can be expected to play to their mean expectation. bol!
logan_matthews9,the only way this doesnt happen is if the distribution of picks isnt even - which is quite possible. i expect a majority on clemson and the under outside of some late line movement. under already has value feel like a majority of sharps are on clemson at various numbers
logan_matthews9,by my count this event has had a consistently improving field the l assit three years and this is another great one. by the nature of its qualification its a very top heavy field - about 11 people with  5 percent  chance of winning but 19 with  2 percent .
logan_matthews9,"if i was more serious about it id gather a collection of generally sharp books for each sport and then probably take the mode at close. 

i dont think theres a one size fits all answer here much in the same way it cant always just be whatever pinnacle/cris says"
logan_matthews9,sargent didnt play well at all against jamaica in the tune up match  for what  it is  worth . part of that was his supporting c assit but i dont think you could come away from that match and say well this guy is definitely going to dominate caribbean countries
logan_matthews9,personally im pulling for capela. imo hes the best defender of the three and hes also the best at the cs biggest weaknesses for like the p assit decade - rebounding. hes 25 closer than vuc to the js. and his contract is way better than what vuc will get
logan_matthews9,i can do a more long form piece on this function but its super useful for this type of study. the hard part is testing it - most of the research ive seen takes the highest percentage marks that as the predicted class and then sees how accurate it was
PikachuBets,"also super lmao at ""care about teams or the sport."" yeah bc everyone knows the most objective takes on sports comes from those who care the most deeply about certain teams! n overtime subjective at all. ofc that is what we are all missing. we are missing the teams! lololol."
PikachuBets,do you really n overtime get it? its really n overtime difficult. the guy who made this must be a drop dead fucking lifetime loser who is rich. like he definitely bets huge amounts and just torches money. if you consistently win they wont even book 500 let alone 150k
PikachuBets,at that point you're paying for access to the network and entry-level corporate opportunities many of which are absolutely closed off to s year tcu uga but n overtime so at stanford. good luck going to mckinsey or i-banking or to a lesser extent big tech from a non-target school
PikachuBets,please enlighten us as to how else one can quantify the size of an upset? what alternative do you propose if n overtime betting markets? it seems like you just want to do it subjectively perhaps based on narratives? if we're biased gamblers then you're also a biased journalist no?
adamchernoff,"la sf: 46.5 - 45
oak lac: 47 - 45
bal cle: 49 - 48
dal phi: 47.5 - 46.5
arz sea: 51 - 50
gb min: 46.5 - 45

divisional totals getting bet down at cris/pin this morning. someone in love with the rematch trend almost across the board..."
adamchernoff,perspective but a staff perspective too (why on earth are they paying out in coins for every single wager or dealing with coins to begin with!?) but that is for another day. i guess my overall take away was utter disappointment. in my mind i had expectations of las vegas...
adamchernoff,but a good way to n overtime convert and retain new customers is to have them intimidated by the stakes before even placing a bet. at the end of the day what this billion dollar company has created is a poorly designed sportsbar/restaurant with the ability to bet on sports.
adamchernoff,you're right. i was generalizing but it depends. for example in a mid/high tier atp event with isner playing karlovic on hard ou touchdown oor the market will be far more efficient in reacting and pricing in what is coming. any hold will move a minimal amount off a 40-x.
adamchernoff,i think the easiest and cheapest way in for a start up is to acce point  bets on only one sport. everyone is trying to be everything. i think is a nice way into the market would be for example only offering nfl but expanding the offering more than competitors.
adamchernoff,unless i have a method in place i have nothing to tell me that the current odds on japan are good/bad. if i create a method that is successful i the expected value lies in probability vs price and the closing line value validates how well i maximize my edge.
Ccon8181,trust me ill be fine. im betting these games personally big positions. i run a sports betting fund with nothing but accredited investors . this was to show those that give advice need to back it up bring some standards to the game show you how to profit long term.
Ccon8181,n overtime true. there is some confusion as the holding period runs from july 31st through january 31st. so in january i was posting -40+  percent  because it was including the season from 2018. y touchdown  we are up. well be using a tracking system this season as well. fyi
Ccon8181,despite n overtime being a top tier coach imomccarthy went with rogers over farve towards the end of favres career.rodgers tanked these l assit few games to get him fired. in addition to fighting with his family add no loyalty to rogers character traits.he deserves his share of the blame
ToddFuhrman,sequence of plays that caused it to go over yes but n overtime as bad by the box score with such a low total and a few  field goal 's kicked inside the 10; result truly could have been a coin flip but as an under better you deserved better
ToddFuhrman,we  daily fantasy sports  o free throw en see such a strong move around key numbers against liability in a prime time game.  even monday with pro cash on the lions ticket distribution wasn't this lopsided and books willingness to move onto a key # here is a strong statement
ToddFuhrman,"there are a handful of athletes who would get paid for their likeness and i'd say a great majority of them see 7 figure paydays at the next level.  i've just had it that we're crying foul for everywhere

rather see a pension healthcare etc for players than anything else"
ToddFuhrman,"counter intuitive  gambling thought of the day...

 daily fantasy sports  determine the merits of  years old you are bet solely by the outcome.  good bets will lose and bad bets will win; the worst thing you can do is reinforce bad habits because you're blinded by just the final score"
ToddFuhrman,"so lauren you're in the city...explain this to me and i'm open to perspective

leafs had the most expensive ticket in the league at $332 highest in the nhl

ra point ors tickets were down 20 percent  on secondary market coming into season lowest since 14-15.  

hoops is first though?"
ToddFuhrman,"yes and no... it is  n overtime like espn had segments on air sponsored by casinos but wouldn't acknowledge parts of their business

 it is  like letting a grocery store advertise they sell meat and bread but pretending they can't advertise alcohol and shampoo;  it is  all under 1 roof"
TheCousinSal,wow - lamar jacksons l assit  touchdown  run might be the play of the year so far in the nfl...but lets go ahead and eliminate him from mvp consideration since it didnt affect his qb rating and because in 3 years his style of play might lead to serious injury.
TheCousinSal,toy story 4 was very good - but how many of these do they have to make before we see the climactic scene where woody cries as his friend wilson the volleyball is run over by an 18 wheeler? spoiler ale: this does n overtime happen in toy story 4.
12Xpert,it is  one think to say the gambling industry is reliant on the pareto principle. almost all business is.  it is  quite another to suggest as labo you are mp carolyn harris has that the industry is reliant on people with gambling problems. the two  daily fantasy sports  necessarily correlate.
12Xpert,or rather i should say for the reason that is the basis of this silly conspiracy attacking the bbc because their narrative doesn't suit those who are anti johnson in the same way that the right endlessly criticise the bbc for a le free throw  bias.  it is  all pathetic.
12Xpert,"regarding first question i've n overtime actually tested it.
regarding second question yes if it is real it is small.
regarding third question yes  it is  possible. bookmakers account for punter stupidity all the time. e.g. punters bet 60 to 40 on overs but prices  daily fantasy sports  reflect that."
12Xpert,besides some bookmakers already do run two different markets. one time i was told by one particularly irrelevant so free throw  brand that i wan't allowed an advertised price but they would give me a shorter one which was shorter than the new price they shortened the original one to.
12Xpert,beyond intuition i guess it would be difficult to know. all you're le free throw  with is t and z tests. i suppose you could use bayesian st against the spread somehow but it still using results to test skill and that o free throw en leads to false conclusions.
12Xpert,definitely ratio. imagine bookie probability of 0.001 (odds = 1000) and true probability of 0.01 (odds = 100). difference is just 0.009 (0.9 percent ) but  years old you are edge is 10. edge correlates exactly with expected roi when betting level stakes. difference to my mind tells you nothing.
12Xpert,"yes we like to win but you must ask why. winning offers self confirmation that we are somebody rather than nobody who can predict the future. if you 'know"" what's going to happen arguably  years old you are life is doing to be a whole l overtime easier and safer."
12Xpert,but the thing is i  daily fantasy sports  find them very amusing either i find they make fun of people who are potentially compulsive in their behaviour. if they already experience self-worth issues is this going to make it less likely or more likely they continue to feel those things?
12Xpert,thanks tony  that is  really helpful and glad you've considered my feedback. genuinely interested to see if this campaign proves effective. i'm n overtime an addiction expert and neither am i an addict so perhaps what i think is n overtime relevant here i just felt uncomfortable with the ads.
12Xpert,th against the spread the point. is there a cause for the difference or is just random? you would see this difference happening by chance 12 percent  of the time which means we cant yet rule out randomness and hence cant c assit the closing line value hypothesis aside yet.

mschwimer,thank you!  please do n overtime expect 5-0 days to keep coming.  i have been on the show for 7 months and this sunday was my first perfect day of 5 picks or more.  that said i do have a winning record (including juice) overall! all about long term value.
mschwimer,update.  a free throw er speaking with o you are legal team they brought up a great point. very hard to adequately respond to questions in 240 characters.  please send all legal questions to  (contact) and i guarantee a response time of 24 hours from o you are legal team.
mschwimer,"agreed!  cizzle deserves a gi free throw . i tried to dm him but he is un dmable. 

so back to the point. why wouldnt you put  years old you are money where  years old you are mouth is? or do you n overtime believe a single thing you say?"
mschwimer,correct. i believe the sports betting world gets this wrong. trust me. i have had many long convos with sports bettors about this. they all think im crazy. but its simply n overtime a true market. so normal economic rules do n overtime apply. again this is my personal opinion
mschwimer,we are more than a $100m company with corporate governance. as im sure you know i cant give one of  years old you are friends money to hold haha. what if that person g overtime hit by a bus? but they might let me put in an escrow. stay tuned.
RufusPeabody,would love feedback from those of you interested in this! for this to work we'll need a l overtime of people to donate their time. do you have technical expertise (i.e. helping build a website) you could volunteer? is there anything i missed? what do you think is important?
RufusPeabody,"there are sharp bettors on the other side who disagree with the play. 

when the tout releases the picks you didn't know which subset will be profitable at the release price and which wouldn't but a free throw er the market reacts you have new information to consider. (5/6)"
RufusPeabody,took $300 initially on rsws but they said they'd bump me to 1k. when i tried my limits were still only $500. they raised my limits to 1k/bet but they had to manually raise them for each bet i wanted. they took to win 2.5k on r2 3-balls (golf)...
RufusPeabody,"i  daily fantasy sports  think the main point here is ""who opens first"". the point is u.s. books copy line movement from offshores even if they didn't take action on that side. sharps are betting offshore  us books are essentially free-riding from the info sharps are providing offshore books"
SportsCheetah,all i said is i didn't think it was that relevant to the game tomorrow with ville's new coach/regime/players etc. i'm sorry i struck a nerve you've been going on and on today about this just pretend i didn't say anything about satterfield to begin with. gl this weekend.
SportsCheetah,"scramble drills are an interesting detail that lockett just mentioned on sc with  russell wilson is a god but i wonder if the seahawks wrs are also just better at ""scramble drill"". n overtime sure if  that is  really even measurable anyway but practicing it seems to pay off."
capjack2000,"their offer to the state was that if they were chosen as the only mobile provider they'd pay a 51 percent  tax rate. if they had to compete they would pay a lower rate.

capjack2000,"let us  put it this way it'll only go up from here. 

oregon lottery needs to do about $25m per month in handle just to break even. they should be able to do twice that once they mature. if n overtime makes a strong case for allowing college betting."
capjack2000,"won't be touched headed into a major election year. next real window is 2023. however what could congress do that would remedy this situation? 

the key imo is public perce point ion. if the public sees the glass ceiling they will pressure sportsbooks into giving them a fair play."
capjack2000,i've been approached by many sites to provide content. i've turned down many as well. i currently do n overtime operate or have a vested interest in any site that makes affiliate income. i won't say never because quite frankly  that is  an unnecessary platitude. read my twitter profile.
dinkinc,i woke up at six with 4 1/2 sleep and realized i never graded my pourier loser... i couldn't go back to sleep until i found out where i bet it and properly graded it...then i made about 15 bets and walked and fed the dog...no sleep for you
dinkinc,the line was always great. one of the them  mckinnon  is a top 5 player and the other two are top 25.  the de point h was a major problem but they are better now. the defense is geared to play offensively. they have peaked at the right time
robpizzola,i wont be around tonight so just wanted to wish everyone a great 2020. thanks to all that supported diabetes research with donations this year... it meant a l overtime to me and is n overtime forgotten. stay safe tonight and cheers to a happy and successful new year.
robpizzola,dubnyk back koivu close to returning to the lineup as well. zucker long-term injury hurts a l overtime though. i have them ranked 19th in my current ratings... i can see them sneaking into the playoffs which could open some hedge possibilities but n overtime much more than that.
robpizzola,"the rams are one of the best teams in the league and the rams have a liability at quarterback can both be true statements. 

if you are going to use the rams' record to justify  years old you are opinion that jared goff is a good quarterback do better."
robpizzola,he's upset that i talk about betting strategy even though i  daily fantasy sports  post my picks. just did a quick search of o you are two handles and it looks like he's been tweeting at me for years without a single response. i can't imagine a sadder life.
RASPicks,any up-and-coming originator with a clear and quantifiable edge in any market who is interested in getting a freeroll email ad minutes to discuss further.  n overtime really interested in p assit records or plays without reasoning just want to be compelled to bet  years old you are stuff.
RASPicks,in all seriousness even if you win on  years old you are own  it is  possible to win more with partners/networking. which i assume you know. there are other less obvious benefits that i  daily fantasy sports  care to get into but always happy to discuss offline if interested.
VegasRefund,there had been rumblings about the latech suspensions all week which is the why the line had moved from -2.5 to -6.5 before the news even went public. so youre n overtime really getting ahead of any line value by jumping on marshall at this point. vegas knows everything.
suuma810,#browns futures have seen a l overtime of action since january. it might n overtime be the worst idea to wait until the regular season to get involved. their schedule in weeks 1-9 is a bit severe at first glance. 5/8 on the road home games vs lar  sea.
suuma810,"home teams off their bye week are now 1-5-1 against the spread  this season.

ClevTA,thursday night football  preview is up. i guess now u can ignore the coleman stuff since all 3 sf rbs are playing. sorry didn't take an against the spread  side tonight. would love to take an in division dd home dog but its just an atrocious matchup for az.
ClevTA,3.5 is a bit egregious for a home dog with the browns fire power. the secondary is an obvious concern but rams ol is pretty bad. browns can get to goff. if this gm was in la i doubt it would be -9.5 which is what this line implies
CizzlingSports,".upd8: in this video posted today at 3:55 pm edt  gives out nd -18 (no price listed of course so assuming he means -110 if he even understands what that is which is questionable).

there's a 0.69 percent  chance his followers g overtime -18.

every trick on the book."
spanky,"exactly. a bookmaker who complains about steam is n overtime writing on action. 

i know the worlds best and they all welcome steam trains planes helico point ers bulldozers etc... a bookmaker is there to write bets. complaining on the type of bets he writes makes him a dressmaker."
spanky,"courtesy and longevity. 

if i could take sundays off i would. unfortunately my bookmakers would notice and kick me out a l overtime faster.  

they give me 6 days/week.  i feel obligated to give them sunday. 
but unless youre a pro you dont have to. 

pick and choose wisely."
spanky,"shared a few laughs with many old friends while reminiscing on the past.

doesnt matter if im breaking bread with billionaires or drinking beer with locals. in costa rica im at home with my peers.

the heartbeat of us sports betting remains in cr.

till next time
pura vida!"
spanky,aga study completely wrong in nj 2c 37-2c clearly states that it is a defense to a prosecution under subsection a. that the person participated only as a player. it shall be the burden of the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence his status as such player
spanky,"appreciate the kind words brock. 
we learn from each other.  i g overtime a l overtime out of it too.  i can sit around drink and talk about betting sports all day long.  plus meeting new people is awesome.  we may have to take this show on the road."
spanky,yeah most industry insiders were shocked. it was all chinese mikes idea to tape me getting kicked out of will hill to start the revolution.  no regrets but this twitter shit can eat up a l overtime of time. i have 100 dms i still have to get to
spanky,i used to piss in a jar so i wouldn't miss anything.  i was glued to my computer watching reading analyzing. this is a live market and if you snooze you lose. the struggles and battles are real. every half point matters. every dollar matters. every relationship matters. (2/2)
DocBettor,clutch sh overtime by devonte graham but i'll play the role of old man yelling at cloud and say i'm dismayed by the hornets' subo point imal clock management. they g overtime possession with 42 seconds le free throw  in a tie game. gotta get the 2-for-1 there. #nbatwitter
PlusEVAnalytics,at what point do the players start to say we deserve better than this re coaches and refs? yeah they get paid either way but th against the spread n overtime how super competitive people are wired and you dont reach the nfl without being a super competitive person.
PlusEVAnalytics,for me its n overtime even about bankroll its about cash on hand. you can have 50 bets out there at 300 each and the chance of going 0-50 is virtually zero but you still cant make that 51st bet if  years old you are balance is tied up

aluckyaday,if i had to put my money on the likes of bet365 and gvc or  years old you are real american books dominating the us market in 5 years time i know who i would choose. would it be selling out or backing the horse most likely to win?
aluckyaday,maybe a large information asymmetry investors on one side and whoever was selling  moneyline as the answer to everything on the other. i doubt they were the first and won't be the l assit to fall for the lure of  moneyline is the answer now what is the question?

aluckyaday,the way a court would decide if the 2 are related would be to gather expert opinion on whether given you know a player from a team won the man of steel would the odds for them being in the top 5 of the league be significantly different. 3/x
aluckyaday,yep. for a balanced book the maximum hold is the vig minus what you lost getting their. people really think the likes of pinney are in this for a couple of  percent . the can get that from roulette! like most things in life bigger risk equals bigger rewards.
aluckyaday,it is much more fun to go to work on a monday morning to say i hit the total qb yards first touchdown scorer and highest scoring quarter but missed the big pay day by 1 rushing yard rather than i lost my point spread bet by a point!
aluckyaday,the single best way to improve a so free throw book profit is profile their customers correctly. sharing data on the biggest mugs in the name of safer gambling smells to me! the need to tell us exactly what they are sharing and exactly how it will be used!
aluckyaday,even more likely in finance as average returns over time tend to be positive. do you consider financial advisers scammers too? i guess at le assit they have to declare that p assit returns are n overtime a predictor or future success. well they do in the uk anyway!
aluckyaday,would have been interesting to see how people would have reacted if all six had won firms had gone bust and people n overtime being paid their life changing bets. pretty sure the reaction would have been they should have n overtime taken the bets in the first place!
aluckyaday,remember they are limited by what their so free throw ware can do. blocking certain runners from multies most likely already available limiting liabilities on just those multies probably n overtime . there may be different solutions in the future when they have had time to update their systems.
aluckyaday,i just get the impression they set the vote announcement order once the votes are known to increase the tension. did they n overtime swap the order of the jury/public vote announcement as well the l assit couple of years? maybe i'm remembering things that did n overtime happen!
aluckyaday,assuming the price data is accurate the way i would do it would be to collect live data myself using the pinney api for matches with the same start time at consistent time before kickoff.  if i then saw a margin differential between matches i'd be convinced until then....
aluckyaday,would be interesting to know what percentage of high street bets were taken at sp. in this particular race i would think sp is an important factor probably the highest percentage of sp bets for any race of the year.  my bog point was more of a general one.
aluckyaday,to maximize profits books target recreational biases. to do that they o free throw en have to offer value on the other side of the bet. if they can restrict sharps from taking the value side of the bet it creates a bigger + expected value for the book.
aluckyaday,or maybe not! the current climate seems to be customer acquisition at any cost. would n overtime surprise me if the trend continues and someone gets the sums wrong again! i wonder how much input stars had on this one and whether they will continue on the same tack.

DannyParkins,how big is the hype for tonight? ticket cost for #bears #packers are up ~48 percent  from l assit years bears v eagles wild card game. itll be either the 2nd or 3rd highest resale market for an nfl opener ever. average resale ticket price over $620. (per ticketmaster)
DannyParkins,also a quick google search shows multiple espn articles a  point i video etc discussing it. if saban announced he was leaving a free throw er this years title game it would be discussed more. dabos bama ties absolutely have been a part of the discussion during this rivalry.
DannyParkins,there's no story or video anywhere on  website about a child getting hit by a ball and going to a hospital. nothing on the assit ros statement the idea of more netting or albert almora's reaction: nothing. the video was also pulled from the condensed version of the game.
DannyParkins,i still think 24 points added for a target score is way too low for the 4th quarter but im willing to admit i was wrong about the rule changes... the quarters resetting for charity with the kids who benefit going crazy adds a fun element and some effort.

Gingfacekillah,they can be depending on  years old you are model configuration. bit of a deto you are from the point i was getting at but full kelly underestimates the risk of ruin and ignores minimum/maximum bet sizes. i wouldn't recommend that. even quarter kelly can get rather exciting lol
Gingfacekillah,thanks! roc and yield are going to vary from sport to sport and depend on the size of dataset the number of models in an ensemble etc. so no one blanket answer is sufficient here. just a whole l overtime of experimentation and backtesting. look for lower limit markets.
Gingfacekillah,made a few edits and fixed a few minor issues with the spreadsheet models. i've submitted my paperback version for publishing. my ebook version content is locked prior to the release on the 10th so i'll be updating it immediately when  it is  live to reflect the improvements. 1/2
Gingfacekillah,couldn't agree more. this is desperate kamikaze betting and shouldn't be celebrated. 9/10 or better times this guy goes bankru point  which is probably why its being promoted. books would love an influx of irrational action. if you're actually trying to win long term  daily fantasy sports  do this.
Gingfacekillah,update: i've been told that in order to take the msc applied st against the spread i'll have to take linear algebra and calculus i  ii as prereqs. that particular school didn't consider my electrical math background sufficient. the msc data science was however satisfied with my math background.

logan_matthews9,i had a job interview recently where i was asked about the next step in soccer analytics and i proposed what i believe is both an ambitious and achievable goal of creating a value-added statistic that can match what war did for baseball (and the like across other sports)

PikachuBets,this is n overtime an area where subjective opinions matter. you are a participant in a highly efficient market. you are bound by the realities of that market which is in turn defined by statistical probabilities. reality = market knows what  it is  doing. you need +clv to win
PikachuBets,yes oops my bad. but the point stands that the coefficient isn't comparable across different eras even in the same league.  i do n overtime know  what  percent impact it would actually have on the ts percent  but there's no question you can't just compare them across 20+ years

adamchernoff,betting on just high leverage opportunities alone in a single game is a bit granular for beating an nfl market (getting into  knowledge wheelhouse now) but i am keeping my eye on how that 65 percent  holds up for bal the rest of the way especially against top secondaries.
adamchernoff,this is n overtime to take away from their performance as a whole this season. but in relation to the market (key point) if their price point continues to climb partially fuelled by extreme success in high leverage situations how high is too high? i think bettors handicapping bal...
adamchernoff,"on a sunday. the amount of money wagered into certain games is significantly higher than others. if you are just following the percentages a free throw er the fact without knowing the handle how could you be confident you are siding with the bookmaker and the ""sharps"" at all?"
adamchernoff,second half lines are similar but there is significantly more information available to shape the odds (score and 30 minutes of play). comparing a second half market which is influenced highly by the new information to a pregame market which did n overtime have any of it is difficult.

ToddFuhrman,i have plenty of views of the behavior of athletes but when it comes to sports betting every player out there has a value and  that is  it; if we only bet on good guys wouldn't have a bankroll le free throw  (as jaded as all of this sounds)
ToddFuhrman,"the most difficult part of being a book: hanging a line on a variety of sporting events monitoring every number

the most difficult part of being a bettor: overcoming the house advantage of standard juice at 11 to 10

as a player always shop around give yourself multiple outs"
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to betting sports one of the best analogies i ever heard was  it is  a l overtime like old school baseball playing station to station; stringing together singles is essential to rallies whereas swinging for the fences every day only leads to strikeouts and bankroll erosion
ToddFuhrman,happy to...this means that theoretically every dollar bet on this prop the house keeps almost 20 cents on the dollar.  in comparison to a traditional -110/-110 where the house keeps 4.55 percent  on a normal football bet.  essentially  it is  stealing without a gun in o you are world
ToddFuhrman,here's my take and why people come a free throw er me during football...is the goal to seed the best teams with more favorable match-ups or most deserving?  for me they're essentially equals but state beat them 3x and won the deepest league in the country rather mind boggling
TheCousinSal,crappy new year. the great bob einstein - aka super dave osborne has le free throw  us. he was a brilliant comedian  i'm proud to say a dear friend. if you want to belly laugh 100x listen to the podc assit   i did with him l assit year. #ripfunkhouser
12Xpert,of course you could show my sample is unrepresentative by publishing data from  years old you are own representative sample but somehow i suspect it won't be forthcoming. in fact my sample exhibits a weaker power distribution than the bwin data which presumably is population data but hey ho
12Xpert,ras = risk adjusted score. so you award a score of 1 - 1/odds for a win and -1/odds for no win. is a means of seeing how a team has performed relative to what the market expected. in this case the market is fair closing  odds (margin removed).
12Xpert,here's an article that helps explain why it take far less time to sp overtime a signal over the closing line than it does via results. using results can take thousands of bets using the closing line (if closing line value hypothesis is valid) can show something in 50.
12Xpert,"either you beat the line or you've already been restricted elsewhere and bookmakers are very good at sharing data about such things with each other.

i've been refused a 1st bet. i've had another account closed a free throw er 1 bet. beat the line (closing odds) you're done."
12Xpert,you see.  it is  just all the same talk. addiction. bad. never balanced. the majority of people who gamble safely  daily fantasy sports  take prohibitionists seriously because of their prohibitionist stance. if you want people to grow up about financial risk taking you have to be cleverer than that.
12Xpert,"in fact there's about a 1 percent  chance you'd be showing a loss a free throw er 9548 bets with the bets that have taken place just because of bad luck. so ask  years old you are self again: ""think you know small sample size; think you understand variance?"""
12Xpert,let us  n overtime go round in circles again with this. this is n overtime a betting related matter. this is an affiliate matter. please ask  years old you are affiliate team to respond to my e-mails. that can't be beyond  years old you are computer algorithm can it?
12Xpert,i think most educated individuals understand perfectly well how the news industry works. its how it works th against the spread the problem. journalists are required to paint the world as a series of black and white truths. it aint like that once you come to really understand uncertainty.
12Xpert,n overtime quite. f10 tells you the probability that what you put in g10 will be exceeded (right tail) by chance assuming f3 is  years old you are expectation. f9 will tell you the probability that what you put in g9 will fall below it (le free throw  tail).
12Xpert,what would the question be? and if neverleavers win it on what grounds would it be argued that there shouldn't be a third? that we know more now about what leaving meant? do we know everything there is to know about what staying means? european defence force? tax harmonisation?
12Xpert,i think it is subjective for all the same reasons. anyway we'll see how it goes next season. if there are no debates about handball penalties then perhaps you are right. if there are then we can debate if rules are being broken or whether people have different interpretations.
12Xpert,this is better news. probably no connection with the dumping of affiliates more likely the general malaise with the perce point ion of gambling in the uk but a little bit of me likes to think that you reap what you sow so i won't be shedding any tears.
12Xpert,its been a shambles for some time. disappeared from major odds comparisons basically because they refused to communicate. managed to close my personal betting account even though id n overtime actually placed any new bets in the two months a free throw er the initial removal of bonus offers.
12Xpert,naturally but they'll never tell you what the answer is because that would reveal information about whether they do in fact move odds in response to volume and/or sharpness. we have to try to find ways of figuring out what they do indirectly and  that is  n overtime easy.

mschwimer,"when i post records and say ""all publicly available picks from betcris at tor"" i am only referring to individual picks that are all shown on the site.  n overtime just the record.  my weekly tweet includes only picks that are all individually listed on o you are site."
mschwimer,yes. see the thread with rufus. i want to make sure we are consistent with o you are auditors. dont want to score it as a loss then they say its a win and wont verify or vice versa. have a call in tomorrow. they are 100 percent  independent.
mschwimer,this has been a fascinating discussion. i believe fanduels ruling is by far the most logical and makes the most sense. however it is clear that is n overtime the industry standard. i will go with the middle of the road answer and just make both plays no action.
mschwimer,appreciate it. ive known a l overtime of gamblers that base their decisions on against the spread  trends. n overtime won is a lifetime winner. only lifetime winners i know are people with models or inside information. n overtime saying its n overtime possible. i just dont know any.
mschwimer,tough  loss on over 8 runs in mets game. ended up scoring 7 runs and le free throw  a combined 25 on base!  also rockies blowing a 7-5 lead with 2 outs in the 8th. sometimes th against the spread how it works. sample size sample size sample size.
RufusPeabody,there are a number of reasons but ill summarize as talent still matters. 12 games is still n overtime *that* much football so all else equal ill take the team with players who were considered more talented going into the season over the one with less talented players.
RufusPeabody,utah is the  #5 team using only current season play but with a pac12 schedule  nonconf schedule of byu n ill and idaho st hard to imagine them leapfrogging bama. how much will committee value p5 conf championship? we are bearish giving 1-loss utah a 22 percent  chance.
RufusPeabody,overall thoughts: the array of offerings is staggering at many of these books most notably dra free throw kings and fanduel. i can bet top continental european in a regular pga event! there are certainly opportunities for sharp bettors. n overtime in a position to comment on longevity.
RufusPeabody,was n overtime a fan of the  app. and they only had 16 nfl rsw totals listed. and just the l assit 16 teams in alphabetical order.  what the fuck . (i wanted to bet teams earlier in alphabetical orders so didn't even try to put anything in.)
RufusPeabody,"if you add ""verified by a neutral third-party"" then yes. (oh and also verify that they  daily fantasy sports  have other sites selling picks.) yeah there's still survivorship bias and all. but if it could set a better standard for the tout industry i could live with it."
RufusPeabody,i'm saying nobody is 60 percent + long-term against against the spread  markets. and if they were they would be leaving a helluva l overtime of money on the table. why would you n overtime bet something (at -110) when it has a 54 percent  chance of winning?
SportsCheetah,ahhh damn that rings a bell now actually. i should put in a request for the shows in podc assit form. n overtime sure if they think its worthwhile since the majority of the content is for games that same night so a l overtime is instantly stale.

dinkinc,a few weeks ago vegas played at nashville and they added a second to the clock before a faceoff with about 25 seconcds to go...vegas tied the game with .7 of a second le free throw  and won in ot...how can there be no consistancy with added time
dinkinc,2/2 have value because of the rotation that they use... use common sense to see if there is a logical reason for this...calgary rarely wins in anaheim..i dont want to use a trend that doesn't involve players who are in today's linup..most trends are nonsense based on variance
dinkinc,i think the disrespect for clayton kershaw is horrible. the dodgers g overtime shut out over the l assit seven innings. jansen earned his way to the bench. spoiled fans who point fingers at a player who g overtime them there year a free throw er year.. awful
dinkinc,that is  a two country comparison and hardly proves we are better than other first world countries... try living in newark.... this is about n overtime feeling superior to what you  daily fantasy sports  know n overtime who is best... also get a dog.. amy needs another challange

robpizzola,theres n overtime a single leafs d-man that has any idea how to play a 2-on-1. this has to be at le assit a dozen times this season where the d-man just wanders over to the guy with the puck and leaves someone wide open for a pass.
RASPicks,frankly just growing tired hearing  and  tell us repeatedly that their way of doing things is the only best and most virtuous.  no one even knows the exact ins and outs of what you guys do so stop pretending that you know how and what everyone else does.

VegasRefund,if theres an automated service out there that could help that be unreal... but until there is.. i normally just check manually and eye ball scores that might look off.. i.e. an underdog winning by a surprising amount or a game tracking to fly over its pre-game total.
VegasRefund,craziest thing to me is deflategate was the seed that sparked all of this.. if brady wasn't suspended than jimmy wouldn't have started the games he wow'd everyone.. and his stock would have been nothing compared to what it was. espn didn't fuel deflategate at all either right?
suuma810,vance joseph single handedly is responsible for this loss. the  field goal  mess before hal free throw ime and playing for a long  field goal  in the end by running into stacked boxes. just another loss on broncos -1 but its really sickening how coaches are so stupid.
suuma810,wenn von miller gegen mitchell schwartz ber 60 minuten probleme hat sagt das se ho you are viel ber die individuelle qualitt aus. und wenn miller da probleme hat schlgt sich das natrlich positiv auf die gesamte pass pro aus. mit flowers wre die ol auch gesamt schlechter.
ClevTA,7-2 in bowl picks on the action app. on iowa st oklahoma and over osu/clemson. feel like im on an island but i think the shock of both teams having to face the athletes  skill on offense will lead to lots of points early at least. bucks 36-33
ClevTA,i think u are confusing the two late possessions. it wasnt the first one it was the 2nd one where the browns failed. when it was 7-6 and its 3rd and 10 from their own 25. u have to run there a free throw er two straight incompletions
ClevTA,just looking at points isnt a good metric for evaluating efficiency. u could sho overtime every single possession and  years old you are points adjusted for pace would be out of this world. nobody has argued that kobe cant score a l overtime its how efficient he was
ClevTA,"bottom of afc playoff race is intriguing so took a sh overtime at projections based on my expected future point spreads:
- cle has highest projection with 3.8 ws but just missing out. they do own tie-breakers over multiple tms
- pit toughest to project
- buf ugh"
ClevTA,browns were -3 at home v buf. browns were -3 at home v pit. they are even teams in the market. pit gets 3 and maybe 3.5 for hfa. depending on injuries in the next month this will be the line. trust me i know how this works
ClevTA,"i sent zac my projected spreads a few games ago and hit buff pitt  miami on the nail so heres what i project the rest of the season:
browns +3.5 at pit
browns -9.5 vs cinci
browns pk at az
browns +3.5 v baltimore 
browns -4.5 at cinci"
ClevTA,incorrect. my entire point was if u kick with 2:30 le free throw  u still have a to and 2m earning. u can kick it deep and if u stop them u get the ball back with over 1m le free throw . u give yourself a shot
ClevTA,th against the spread if u actually think zeke is the diff between a super bowl and not. he saw the rams go to the sb with cj anderson and no gurley. pollard can be really good. so if they go 3-0 w/out zeke why would he budge?
CizzlingSports,"in aug you said the form d constituted security for the guarantee

PlusEVAnalytics,i feel like this is a pretty big hole in coaches in-game strategy. maybe its too much to ask for them to explicitly use the vegas line but at le assit have some awareness of when  years old you are win prob is extremely high/low and adjust accordingly.
PlusEVAnalytics,"blocked because 99 percent  of what he says is brilliant and i called him out once on the other 1 percent .
its saying that the preference shd be to avoid medical interventions in non life threatening situations because they could be proven by questionable sciencehave unintended consequences"
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah th against the spread the piece of this that holds together the le assit for me. there are much better ways to accomplish that objective. and why would sports teams hire him on the basis that he can win at betting why would they care about that?
aluckyaday,you are looking at things from a selfish point of view though. why n overtime explain why they do it? how it benefits recreational punters? you are n overtime their target market why should they keep you happy to the detriment of their best customers? its just  business.
aluckyaday,the problem is its a pain in the butt to work out what the correct stakes should be when you have multiple related bets running at the same time. the maths is incredibly complicated! you also need to know  years old you are edge which is really guesswork.
aluckyaday,as you are running simulations then it should be pretty easy to pick up the value in the each way part of the bet. would be interesting to see how that compares with the win value. is 1/2 odds to finish 2nd a realistic representation of the probability?
aluckyaday,william hills terms and conditions clearly say bets with a related contingencies are n overtime allowed and if one is acce point ed by mistake it will be settled as two singles at half stakes. so the only question to ask is were the two bets related 1/x
aluckyaday,legal bookmaking is n overtime here for the players.  it is  only purpose is to generate tax revenue. it is the job of the njdge to ensure that revenue is maximised n overtime to look a free throw er sharps. they can look a free throw er themselves.
aluckyaday,exactly the opposite they are n overtime afraid they are running a business with a model that will maximise their profits. they will take much more than one dollar but only from customers that will be profitable for them. why make 2 percent  when you can make 30!
aluckyaday,good stuff as always. interesting about why people would train in hard to beat markets. i guess betting in those markets the cost of failure is less. you can't really make a big mistake. unlike taking on ali where failure would have been a l overtime more painful
aluckyaday,but it is unlikely we will be able to put it right on the same terms maintaining the o point  outs from the lisbon treaty we have been granted. a referendum that would be unlikely to stand if binding is no basis for making such a momentous decision.
aluckyaday,more useful than having nothing. without predictions planning can n overtime be done. the planners are aware of the variance. you can get life insurance even though their is a large variance in life expectancy. without a prediction model for life expectancy that would n overtime be possible.
aluckyaday,365 is a marketing company n overtime a bookmaker. it needs the big turnover/ hold to fund that marketing. without restrictions is that marketing model possible? look at portugal where gambling is now legal but the big operators are n overtime interested. tax stop that model working there.
aluckyaday,that is interesting. so money they know is n overtime from a sharp source is ignored as they know they will win from that long term anyway. isn't the problem with doing that that you are n overtime maximizing  years old you are profit from the public money?
aluckyaday,"""a company with global ambitions for the betting exchange model that was forced to return to the basics of traditional fixed odds betting. a company that has actually only managed to grow a free throw er having embraced the very thing that it set out to destroy. """
aluckyaday,this is totally overlooked by people commentating on the game. that v assit majority do n overtime bet to win they are betting for the excitement. the vig is the price they pay to get it. books are selling dopamine and there is a huge market for it.
aluckyaday,"do you know if they delete records/tipsters? is n overtime a distribution of t-scores is the best way to do it  rather than do each tipster individually collect all the tips calculate the t-scores for each tipster pl overtime the distribution and marvel at the ""gaussianess"" of it"

EdMillerPoker,"hi ed im going to be the best poker player in the world can you recommend which of  years old you are books is best for a beginner?

like ive gotten that email probably more than a hundred times.

i get #lifegoals and stuff but maybe slow down"
EdMillerPoker,yes in many ways its similar to the poker books in terms of readability and audience. main difference is in poker you then go play $1-$2 and hopefully win. theres no $1-$2 in sports betting its more like you have to start out playing against the $10-$20 players.
EdMillerPoker,and it seems clear to me that a single company of the scale of amazon could feasibly meet the entire worldwide demand for sports gambling entertainment. theres really no room for hedge funds or the like which are really a pimple on the ass of global economic activity
EdMillerPoker,yeah agree that university costs are unsustainable and something likely to give esp with mid-tier schools. i am ske point ical of the scaling across verticals story. i think so free throw ware engineering is the lowest hanging fruit and kudos for going there and hitting it hard.
EdMillerPoker,this is to be expected in my opinion. the state by state rollout and unwillingness to allow mobile in many states is slowing the back end development. nj still only real new market. its a pretty decent-sized market but it cant fund all the development that needs done.
EdMillerPoker,obv true but as i said before truly competing on margin can't exist today bc the infrastructure doesn't exist. it will exist in the future. you have two outlets selling the same product one with better branding and one with a slightly (slightly) lower price obv branding wins

LeeSharpeNFL,how much does the committee value actual record vs. margin of victory/defeat vs. strength of victory/losses/schedule? i'm sure they are looking at numbers but  it is  also easy for them to pick the playoffs they want and then retroactively justify which st against the spread support that seeding.
LeeSharpeNFL,"what was trubisky doing on thst run? sigh.

AndyMSFW,but to seth's point finding those spots where  years old you are numbers are wildly different would be the easiest way to sharpening things up if you can figure out why  years old you are numbers over or under rate a team compared to the markets in general
JoeyKnish22,youre looking at it too narrowly/selfishly. reduced juiced doesnt sell. books arent gonna reduce profitability just to do it. a $25 free bet would get more ppl in the door than -105 lines. until that changes on a massive scale theres no incentive for it to become standard
JoeyKnish22,pizzola and peabody make a little money and theyre off hiking in south america going to wine tastings. cheetah wears makeup daily on tv now. some others went and hid behind the counter. but some of us are still grinding edges and taking bullets in the fucking trenches
JoeyKnish22,i might be able to get us a host and bottle service (flint water on the rocks) if i call in a favor. will make sure were on the wmu sideline tho so you dont spend the entire game trolling nard dog and hurling insults at his family.
JoeyKnish22,it was a 3 point game so -3/-3.5 was essentially the same bet (getting packers money line) the extra .5 in this case would only have come into effect in the unlikely event of a tie. proper live  moneyline price was -130/-135 so sharp books went -3 (-130ish).
JoeyKnish22,the key here being unlike notre dame and oklahoma futures l assit year. instead of being -14 or higher in a playoff game. if lsu made it in at 11-1 with the victories theyd have (and accompanying power rating) the 33/1 would actually have value/be trade-able for profit.
JoeyKnish22,sure. a couple have fucked it up. but new jersey has basically created the playbook all you need to do is copy/paste and look at the data. michigans proposals have been fine its partys arguing over tax rates and education funding which should have been resolved by now.
TheKostos,i consume a l overtime of sneaker content on instagram and youtube and wanted to give a shoutout to my fav sneaker reviewer jd.  daily fantasy sports  know the dude personally but he answers questions over insta and i dig his content. if you're into sneaker content follow:
LockyLockerson,"lastly ""talent score"" was a basic metric introduced in the guide and it did pretty well in identifying teams that could have top-performing seasons.   years old you are 4 playoff teams this year with talent score entering the year: lsu (1st) ohio state (7th) oklahoma (8th) clemson (11th)"
LockyLockerson,"just by using the market win totals to generate a net rating pelicans-ra point ors ""should"" be more like 5.5-6.  but what is zion worth? tough to know since he's ya know never played an nba game at all and there's de point h to take those minutes."
LockyLockerson,a l overtime of you are going to want to bet on clemson or alabama to win the title.  just a reminder that books will frequently have many different markets for teams that popular all of them involving the team to win the title in some capacity. 1/2
LockyLockerson,also why wouldnt they just advise on props and small limit stuff with their player analysis background instead of trying to beat that behemoth of a market. most people who subscribe wouldnt hit the ceiling of the prop limits and pff would actually win a decent percent honestly
DannyParkins,the question as i see it with mitch for now is simple: was the denver gameplan an abberation because of circumstances (fangio altitude difficulty of winning in denver in se point ember etc) or an admission from nagy that mitch cant execute the offense he wants to run?
DannyParkins,well so you disagree. th against the spread cool. kind of the essence of sports talk. i dont get how a team with the 2nd highest payroll in baseball that way outspends its mediocre division n overtime winning said division is a success but to each their own.
DannyParkins,yea i said on yesterdays show the cubs have their big 4 offensively of baez-kb-rizzo-contreras and it felt like heyward can be counted on so they needed one more guy to make the offense special and that schwarber was the best candidate. early returns so far are good.
DannyParkins,theo at 2. aj pierzynski at 4. james mccann fresh off his first all-star nod will join us a free throw er catching dylan cease in his debut in game 1 of the double header today.  sends ya into  years old you are holiday weekend starting at 2.
DannyParkins,of course. my main criticism of garpax has been luck is n overtime a plan and then pax literally used that line in his pre-lottery press conference. im with you. my point is that anger should already be there n overtime dependent on results of ping pong balls.
DannyParkins,i have every confidence in the world we can help get these guys a little closer to a very worthy goal. this story took my breath away. just read it if you want to be inspired and share it if you can... thank you. also follow my man
DannyParkins,the dejection in the dudes voice who was reporting on cnn live a free throw er being on hold for an ho you are when he finally g overtime through and then they hung up on him mightve been the most relatable cable news moment ive ever seen.
Gingfacekillah,here's a supplemental visual guide for the mlb expected pitcher k's prop discussed in this podcast. this is a basic version with regression coefficients taken from fangraphs. this can be improved considerably but  that is  for you to discover on  years old you are own. happy edge hunting.
Gingfacekillah,this is going to depend a bit on how you tackle the problem - looking at point differential in a set looking at sets won differential or looking at both. looks like the weibull distribution might be worth checking out for points scored mov in a given set.
Gingfacekillah,"i use questions like ""how might x work?"" ""what would successful method x look like?"" ""what indicators x is working might i expect to see?"" as useful starting points for brainstorming a new idea.  daily fantasy sports  see nearly enough of that discussed. ego + dismissiveness = -ev."
Gingfacekillah,fielding errors have been brutal in this game. i suppose th against the spread to be expected. tracked this game well until about inning 5 regarding hits and bases exce point ing errors. beat the line by 0.08. well see if  million can squeak out a win here.
Gingfacekillah,median pace usually produces the lowest expected result. estimating player possessions per  minutes *  minutes played then adding all estimated possessions for each team and dividing by two usually produces the highest result. the median between those two is in between. th against the spread a good range
Gingfacekillah,for value bet seekers / line grinders its essential to understand. it can be added as a feature to a modelling attem point  if you can calculate it accurately. ultimately though you bet against the price offered vig included. any winning forec assit must beat the vig-included price.
logan_matthews9,i think from a modeling perspective you could focus on the variables that have the greatest impact for that course. weather would be useful sure but if youve g overtime 15+ years of data with probably 400+ rounds per year i think weather is going to be noisy
logan_matthews9,i know you base it off league averages but those daily changes are almost insignificant this deep into the season. and unless a team is on a back to back their numbers wont change at all (and b2b teams wont have lines posted before their first game anyways)
PikachuBets,"eddddieeeeee a few days ago this was still $150!!! how are you going to to  years old you are precious clients that they paid 50 percent  more?!?!?!?

oh wait you dont have any clients you fool th against the spread why you had to drop the price loooooooool"
PikachuBets,"b4 someone's triggered by my saying he's clueless (""but he's winning!"") let me point out that this is a guy who is ""very hesitant"" to bet  college basketball  until february but he thinks he can be convinced that maybe there is value in dec/jan. what a fucking joke"
PikachuBets,lmao at calling situational trends and consensus wager reports data to become a better bettor. kind of like calling the toilet paper i wiped my ass with this morning art to make my house look better. tan doesnt know jack shit about real analytics so quit fronting already
PikachuBets,sure i get that. seeing college players duke it out as nba players is awesome. but that wasnt my question so lets focus. is producing nba players what college teams should be judged on? or should teams just be judged on their level of play as college teams?
adamchernoff,well under the same logic the packers have racked up poor metrics against all teams this season...being a fan can be blinding. good thing about betting is you can put  years old you are money into the market and see if its validated or not. enjoy the games.
adamchernoff,without getting into success rate efficiency numbers dvoa and performance vs schedule in which gb has put up numbers barely deserving of a playoff sp overtime let alone a bye consider that the packers have given up 0.2 yards per play more to their opponent than they gained...
adamchernoff,as i said on the podc assit this morning this is n overtime advocation to go out and blindly bet every under. in fact i think the opposite may be in play for many games where suppressed totals can provide an opportunity to consider a fair priced over.
adamchernoff,"continuity:

customers are there to gamble. once a bet is made and the outcome is decided the process of making another bet should be as simple as possible with as few barriers to do so as possible. the easier the process is the better the product/experience will be."
adamchernoff,the betting market and understanding why games move. if you do n overtime have an odds screen get one. donbest is extremely expensive for most bettors but it works well (usually) and tracks bookmakers that other odds comparison websites do not. when you get a screen align your...
adamchernoff,does this mean that betting a free throw er any line move is a bad idea? absolutely not. limits handicapping pricing modelling and other factors will when a wager can be placed. but following reverse line movement ensures that you will always take the worst of the number.
adamchernoff,as you fill out  years old you are game sheets remember that the purpose is to document information and organize it based on what different types of bettors in the market will value. no right or wrong just keep asking questions and building on the answers you find.
adamchernoff,ha! absolutely correct. embarrassing mistake on my part. i might get 0.001 percent  of a mulligan for the mistype given i was 8 years old during that dra free throw . remember the '06 season well. both went straight to the pro-bowl. also the first year for bush/colston.
adamchernoff,if only the data feed so free throw ware and staffing cost to be competitive in the us regulated market didn't run $1m+ per year or a few percent of total handle there would be a l overtime more operators entering the space at the terms listed above.
adamchernoff,it took all morning for the total to come down from 55 to 53. in the span of the l assit 8 minutes it has gone back from 53 to 55. no shortage of l assit minute buyback a free throw er the over reaction to the snow.
adamchernoff,"denver:

pass o success rate: 18th
rush o success rate: 6th
pass d success rate: 17th
rush d success rate: 29th
o line: 7th
d line: 27th

if keenum can come around there is a l overtime of upside week to week against the spread  with this team."
Ccon8181,lay 27.5 points with two sides and the teams go 0-2 su.. yuck!! completely wrong sides. combine that with a horrible beat with ucf and tenn mizz scoring 3 in 4th quarter th against the spread an ugly ass day. onto sunday. where a solid day is needed
Ccon8181,i know long game.. but to let the bucs drive right down the field a free throw er getting  years old you are head l assit week n overtime a good sign. i had memphis yesterday so ik its a long way from over but defense looks bad.
Ccon8181,even with the #nba season over seeing the #nbadra free throw 2018 tonight takes me back to what capped a tough nba postseason. rockets +5.5 missing 27 straight 3 point  and blowing 11  point  hal free throw ime lead to lose by 9. that was a big loss.
ToddFuhrman,"wont hear me argue health because it definitely favors seattle and its why theyre road favorites.

also cant argue with russ being more tested qb and vulnerability of playoff debuts but how everyone ignores sea losing at dallas to garret and dak in similar sp overtime beyond me"
ToddFuhrman,n overtime at all still a l overtime to unpack just fascinating to see market sentiment towards a team that everyone ran to back l assit week at chicago.  nobody wanted the rams vs seattle either  it is  all about what have you done for me lately league
ToddFuhrman,"i doubted lamar when he came into the league and his ability to play the position at this level.  never imagined this was possible which means he along with the ravens coaching staff deserve full marks.

however i'm sure  will still list lamar 6th on his mvp ballot"
ToddFuhrman,"well i think this is a bigger discussion because the casual fan or mainstream media will never understand that a team with a worse record can be ""better"" than their opponent.  always wild for me to read people ranking teams on record when schedules couldn't be more disparate"
ToddFuhrman,justin good point...next time i'll say you can go 1-11 su if you consistently land  moneyline dogs at +1500.  i think you're taking this way too far and when people talk gambling in generalities they assume most bets are -110; appreciate you being so detail oriented for us
ToddFuhrman,ha we joke about it all the time but  core mission from day 1 was to make better bettors rather than just try and pick games on the  podcast so hopefully you've learned something from us over the years (and developed a new found love for lara bars)
ToddFuhrman,exactly my main point here;  it is  n overtime that the team won't have firepower or potential this season to be good if they gel but considering who they're priced shorter than right now  it is  beyond insanity for a roster that doesn't have championship pedigree or experience
TheCousinSal,i lost my pro bowl bet on the nfc because sean payton went for it on 4th and 5 at midfield with a 6 point lead and 3 minutes le free throw . to his credit - he coached like he would in a real game. #whynotpunt #whybettheprobowl
12Xpert,no i dont. gambling is a product like alcohol holidays and ice cream. all cause harm. all also provide much pleasure to many people. people pick and choose their moral battles almost all of it is virtue signalling because they can so easily be shown to be hypocrites.
12Xpert,we live in strange times indeed. prime minister lies to the queen and is re-elected as prime minister with a landslide.  i think this is what happens when people who feel they've been le free throw  behind and ignored are given a chance to have their views heard.
12Xpert,whilst leicester were in just the right place at the right time (when the big 6 went on leave) ipswich can consider themselves unlucky. they spent two seasons with a lowest total of 36 and an average of 52.38. that would normally be enough to keep them up.
12Xpert,"for example 1000 bets of odds = 2.00 positive expected value = 2 percent  and stakes = 2 percent  will have a performance distribution looking like this.

mean bank growth = 1.49 which is more than the median (centre of distribution) = 1.22 because the distribution is lognormal."
12Xpert,if  it is  only faith you're bothered about then i'm told assit rology and alchemy are worth following. taleb would probably add economists to that. religion is also worth a look. i believe john cha point er 20 verse 27 has some things to say on the subject.
12Xpert,certainly something worth thinking about but on what grounds do you think it should be considered? n overtime just what you see but something more fundamental about the nature of betting outcomes. besides 1 in 10 years is still really only 1 in 500 weeks if betting weekly.
12Xpert,in which case youre saying its n overtime possible to make a living from betting. you may say as youve argued with  that you can by following tipsters. but you still have the same value problem. how do you know all  years old you are tipsters are skilled?
12Xpert,i wouldn't doubt  years old you are sincerity although no doubt others who like to paint in black and white would do so. that is precisely how most affiliate tipsters probably operate.  that is  n overtime to say that a few aren't knowingly advising bigger negative expectation bets.
12Xpert,i've seen people invest in tipster funds who have lost thousands because the 'fund manager' g overtime it wrong and there were no contracts in place to offer any protection and attem point  recovery of lost funds. never hand over large sums of money to a 'tipster'. never.
12Xpert,i mixture of greed and overconfidence greases the wheels of touting. almost none do anything other than chance. almost all and the customers who throw money at them believe that can't be true. when i show them the data cognitive dissonance takes ro overtime from which denial blossoms
12Xpert,yes  that is  true but then you're effectively suggesting you shouldn't bet until the l assit possible moment and then the odds will be maximally efficient and hardest to beat. which further begs the question wh against the spread the point of pre-closing ratings if they aren't better?
12Xpert,no idea i  daily fantasy sports  have the data but you would be a fool to look for anything and believing there was any point to it unless you had previously developed a methodology that could explain why this pattern occurred.. that is the point of this thread.
12Xpert,but difference with wocs and maxi's draws stuff as i understand his systems to be is that wocs was developed with a priori thinking (pinnacle prices are wise) which could then be tested with data. trawling data until you find combinations of things that are profitable is not.

mschwimer,question to all the vegas bettors out there.  for 11amet/8am point  start times for ncaa basketball games how do you get bets down on those games?  do certain books open early? do you put them in the night before? or are those games just never available to bet?

-first place unbeaten dartmouth falls to 2-6 cornell at home as a 30-point favorite (+4000 ml)"
RufusPeabody,consensus among panelists is us sports betting will have a handle of $150-$250 billion in the next 10 years. though yass is hopeful if trading costs go down (wed need an exchange model here) we could see a trillion dollars. i for one am rooting for that.
RufusPeabody,an exercise in how statistics can be manipulated. jambos emails a survey to their subscribers. subs that are still betting the picks are the only ones who even notice the email.  texts his boys to please fill out the survey. this results in an extremely biased sample.

capjack2000,"sbtech so free throw ware is ok. pretty much tends to copy the pinnacle line but with full -110 juice. plenty of derivative bet o point ions though.

capjack2000,"the solution is n overtime preventing banning  it is  making the system more transparent so players know where they stand. 

i have a long article i've shopped around detailing how a sl overtime club mentality towards sportsbetting would benefit all parties involved. maybe you'll read it soon."
capjack2000,"based on handle it looks like fanduel sportsbook has almost the same market dominance in pa that they have in nj (48.9 percent  in pa 53.4 percent  in nj).

blows a hole in the theory that fanduel's success in nj is based solely on proximity to ny."
capjack2000,"my favorite bill lyon column was a fictional meeting of the fo you are philly teams at the legion of sports excellence (lose) held atop city hall.

capjack2000,the irs guidance on reporting gambling winnings is to report all wins as gross income and losses as itemized deductions against that on schedule a. the irs does allow for session based reporting so you can net the result of a session assuming you keep contemporaneous logs.
capjack2000,"actually you cant bet a game more than once. th against the spread how they prevent people circumventing the withholding. 

its also the reason they dont have in-game betting. (this just keeps getting better right?)

they project $300m in handle. who wants to break it to them?"
capjack2000,"this isn't some anonymous twitter head  this is an industry legend who has booked some of the biggest wagers and handles of the p assit 30 years.

capjack2000,this actually influences where i choose to play. best i've seen is playmgm which o free throw en approves withdrawals before i even get the confirmation that i've requested one. worst is caesars who without fail takes a week to hit my account no matter the size.
capjack2000,pa allows casinos to effectively write-off any wager made with promotional credits. it actually plays favorably for a casino since maybe half of them win. it reduces their tax burden in the high tax state. fanduel would be well to realize this and be generous with promos.
capjack2000,"wow. there is so much bad information in this story that it is borderline criminal.

capjack2000,i've struggled with this as well. my feeling is it creates too much of a cloud of murkiness. even if you only acce point  affiliate deals from the best books for sharps it still creates doubt. it limits the ability to monetize  years old you are content.
capjack2000,it is  been a while for me....but essentially take the pythagorean projection factor in war for player changes divide that by games in the season. adjust as season progresses. i thought it was a very good book in 2013. i still think  it is  a good book.

dinkinc,there were 35 seconds le free throw  and they would be down fo you are points .. better chance to stop the chargers who have zero time outs. if la had a time out they would have used it so tenn calling one has to be wrong

robpizzola,joey knish is a close friend of mine so we can make these jokes with each other. i let him live in my basement (which i built with 20 btc because i'm a cuck) when times were tough for him due to his horrible college football wagers.
robpizzola,one of my favorite moments was when we started using theme music for o you are dickwads of the nights and we intentionally changed cohen's theme music to some gay stripper music (n overtime that there's anything wrong with that) and he was totally caught off guard.
robpizzola,raichubets vs. pikachubets would be a long drawn out capping contest with each of them hitting each other with plays that are n overtime very effective (lots of negative expected value stuff) golembets would definitely own the much weaker pikachubets with some six-game round robin parlay winners.
robpizzola,i agree with a l overtime of the complaints in general but have still found it enjoyable.  it is  definitely n overtime peak thrones but i thought l assit night's episode had a very old school g overtime vibe to it especially the l assit half hour.
RASPicks,also just want to point out i am sure boston has been put on many large freerolls in his lifetime.  is that n overtime a form of buying picks?  were those people unwise to freeroll you?  i think we can all agree there are exce point ions.
RASPicks,it isn't just ras.  my team typically subscribes 4-5 different guys depending on time of year and that is n overtime counting free people we keep tabs on.  most aren't even long term winners but we're able to find value in them for the reasons i mentioned.

suuma810,the #bears had a goal line fumble and a goal line pick a free throw er an initial touchdown by tarik cohen was nullified because of an opi by trey burton. #dolphins scored two long touchdowns on short passes with massive yac when chicago couldn't tackle. brutal.

PlusEVAnalytics,shout out to my new australian followers. never been there but i love the idea of it - lets combine the culture and weather of california with the sociopolitical environment of canada! scores poorly in the wildlife that can kill you d expected points added rtment though.
aluckyaday,you would prefer that they prefer n overtime to do that. as a business it is their choice how to operate. what you prefer is irrelevant. it is what the majority of their customers prefer is what matters. as they will never see a trader decision letter...
aluckyaday,who says they are being ripped off? if is up to the purchaser to decide if the entertainment they are buying is worth the cost. i find it strange how people who would be totally against state price/product controls in any other industry support them in gambling.
aluckyaday,that depends how you define what makes up the sum. liquidity is created when their is a benefit for both parties in the transaction. trading risk for financial gain for example.   in a purely speculative market one side gains the other looses. this is what limits liquidity
aluckyaday,but without the underlying securities would the institutions be writing the o point ions and subsequently the etfs? why are institutions n overtime currently involved in sports betting? my guess is because there is no underlying market to underpin the pricing of  years old you are straddles.
aluckyaday,some would say bookmaking in general is morally unacce point able. if you are winning it is coming from losers. some of whom are very vulnerable people. i think this is a much bigger moral issue it does n overtime kill you if you can't get on!
aluckyaday,i think the main problem was nobody in government though the referendum could go the way it did so they had n overtime even considered how they were going to actually deliver it. hence why the irish border problem was n overtime mentioned in the original campaigns.
aluckyaday,restrictions are nothing to do with bookmakers confidence. they are the most profitable way to operate in a recreational market. big bets are n overtime the issue. adverse selection is. however much you moan it is n overtime going to change. recreational books  for recreationals players only!
aluckyaday,maybe they have and know taxation like that makes it very unattractive to sharps impossible to win without luck. so the won't have to limit players stakes as all they will have is recreationals. if you like a big bet come to oregon we wont restrict you!
aluckyaday,do you think sharp books need to operate in multiple jurisdictions? sharps will find a way to bet with them if the cost of doing so is low enough. i guess it depends how well their  methods of extracting the recreational money from those jurisdictions are working?
aluckyaday,"sorry week 4 i deleted. just ran the model again these were the selections...

new england at buffalo  back buffalo bills +7
kansas city at detroit  back kansas city chiefs -7
minnesota at chicago back chicago bears -1
dallas  at new orleans back new orleans saints +2.5"
aluckyaday,who controls the prices/limits with the kambi operators? its n overtime the so free throw ware that matters but if they are competing against each other. are they all using a default kambi price feed and crm or are they controlling the settings themselves competing on price/limits?
aluckyaday,randomness is a huge part of betting  daily fantasy sports  let if fool you. roi is n overtime always the best way to look at the performance of  years old you are bets. there is some great stuff on this by  on the pinnacle resources website. 1/2
aluckyaday,an exchange for only 2 way bet where you could see the full order book and who had placed the orders would be interesting.  where you can select which order to match. a place where sharps can compete against each other to show they are the best.
aluckyaday,hopefully it is. it has g overtime crazy here. although it is being reigned back in. this soccer season the books have volunteered a whistle to whistle ban on gambling advertising a free throw er thre against the spread by the regulators to ban it all together.
aluckyaday,they have n overtime been able to get traction in the european market and have been declining recently. recreational punters in europe have shown they prefer ease of use offers free bets bonuses the ability to do parleys and bet builder type bets over possibly better prices.
aluckyaday,but their plan is to change the us market. the us market has never had internet and app betting. their business models are built on millions of recreational players having a 10 buck bet whenever they watch a game. they  daily fantasy sports  want or need pros.
aluckyaday,the issue comes when a sharp book has to compete with a so free throw  book for the losers. the so free throw  books gives recreational players what they want. many props and offers. they choose the so free throw  book over the sharp all day long.
aluckyaday,it is an interesting one using  yield distribution calculator the 7.5 percent  combined is a 1 in 10000 event for a 50/50 bet so it seems significant. but how many possible systems are there? what do you think joseph significant? or just another example of data mining?

joeyisaks,10k a year and anyone can register as a bookie with the state and run their own operation... a licensing agreement that holds you accountable and registered with state so u cant vanish when a player wins.  head fees can go to govt ...who would say no?
EdMillerPoker,"that means

* no delays
* no bet rejections
* no ""palp"" bet cancellations

it means what you see is what you get. if you click a bet you get a bet.

to deliver that you need sharp error-free lines which is exactly what deck prism provides."
EdMillerPoker,i used to eat meat at every meal and then gave up 90 percent  of it very easily. i still wanted to eat sushi sometimes and a few other more special things i liked and so i just did for several years and didn't worry about it.
EdMillerPoker,thank you that is a kind thing to say i agree i think matt may be close to the best in the world at this exact task and i think  it is  a big reason we have a good sh overtime to succeed where others may not
EdMillerPoker,ppl talk about it like its all or nothing but imo th against the spread silly. every time you decide what to eat or buy you can make a vegan or more vegan choice and imo if you start doing that consciously youre on a good track
EdMillerPoker,main purpose of that sentence is to temper expectations. i  daily fantasy sports  want ppl reading the book and thinking they're going to get rich and underestimating how much extra work you have to do (and do well). i think  it is  much easier to be break-evenish.
EdMillerPoker,"i'm now the self-appointed kidney scold but ""con you out of a kidney"" is fucking brutal and ruins this whole silly hypothetical. kidney disease kills lots of people and live donor kidney transplants save lives and one kidney works basically as well as two and consider donating.."
EdMillerPoker,oh 100 percent .  that is  exactly the transaction. my only point is that the sum of global consumer demand for sports gambling entertainment is tiny compared to global financial markets.. small enough that there's really no economic value to abstracting it the way financial markets do
EdMillerPoker,"agree.. imo the ideal gambling game

1. can be beaten
2. is very expensive in time to beat at scale
3. does n overtime beat the average recreational trying to play well with an intuitive strategy for too much
4. regularly presents novel situations decisions or questions"
GolcondaFund,"this is when free markets can fail.

GolcondaFund,"n overtime loving this cards play.
this game screams either det pull away or lose su.

why tease bad team with new coach qb when so many other viable o point ions with greater edge? honest question.

LeeSharpeNFL,i think i  daily fantasy sports  rest but i'm n overtime sure. i plugged the games into my model and it showed sea is more likely to win  minutes at sea than sea at phi but it wasn't by a ton.  it is  a close call imo.
LeeSharpeNFL,"curious which you think would be a better use of time in terms of working on model improvements:

1) improving overall baseline measure of team efficiency

2) absorbing injury data from 3rd party site (may have trouble finding historically to train model?) and ada point ing that."
LeeSharpeNFL,"having a former nfl official telling you when to challenge might be useful for identifying whether there's really a foul. but their expertise is n overtime in assessing the leverage of the challenge.

challenging 60 seconds into the game -- especially over pass inteference -- is awful."
LeeSharpeNFL,"thanks! honestly i'm kind of hoping trubisky gets thoroughly embarrassed because this narrative of ""maybe he's finally gotten his shit together!"" makes me worried pace wants to roll with him again in 2020 and he needs to learn that is n overtime a reasonable o point ion."
LeeSharpeNFL,"selecting mythics by predictivity is overrated. as always you should choose metrics by seeing which one ranks  years old you are qb the highest.

 that is  why my preferred metric is n expected points added  (negative  expected points added ) where trubisky is a top 5 qb."
LeeSharpeNFL,possibly but what ultimately matters is whether the speaker's words have the effect of perpetrating beliefs that people of color are less talented or less deserving. the impact of one's words matters more than the intent behind them.  it is  on the speaker to learn and adjust.
LeeSharpeNFL,to be fair in the legion of boom era it did seem like part of seattle's defensive strategy was to actively push the limit in terms of what they could get away with in terms of defensive penalties (though that only contributes to the x-axis of course).
whale_capper,even if we do see a high level im interested in having 8/1 or better on thiem in my pocket especially if the market favors domi in the match odds... might see nadal open -400 bet down to -300 if they meet in the sf or final

JoeyKnish22,to somewhat pr expected points added re for michigan legalization. were looking to expand knishy enterprises in some other areas before domestic operators are here. if you have pph/credit accounts and youd like to partner with us sho overtime me a dm and we can discuss further.
JoeyKnish22,read this thread from the ca point . even if its n overtime  years old you are state its important as these laws are used to shape future legislation. some absolutely egregious regulations. which is n overtime shocking coming from the scam artist in deep south politics.
JoeyKnish22,"all auction jokes aside. we will be keeping the buy in very reasonable (probably $100) to specifically avoid a situation like that. as it turns out the government n overtime a big fan of making  years old you are pool six figures! 

and more ppl can participate."
JoeyKnish22,if youve heard either of us on the radio youd probably never know it lol. mental health is a tricky/complex issue. but theres a ton of ppl out there dealing with it and my best advice dont ignore it. talk to somebody my dms are always open.
JoeyKnish22,its something ill have to manage my entire life. but having a great support system of family friends and even a bunch of degens ive met through this app. you dont realize how much even just a quick check up text hey man how you feeling means.
JoeyKnish22,n overtime rich enough for me to invest and staying away from nfc north as i think the division probably the most balanced of any in football n overtime much edge to be had. however if i had to bet on one team/price that would be it.
JoeyKnish22,issue is obviously at bama but a chance they could lose that game and still make the playoff at 11-1 even without an sec title. again its unlikely due to schedule. but i think youre getting the 3rd to 5th best team in the country at 33/1.
TheKostos,nothing wrong with that th against the spread capitalism baby. price has gone up $100 on stockx in the l assit 20 minutes. supply and demand. i work hard so fuck it im paying resale if i really want a pair and the haters can kick rocks
TheKostos,eric bienemy would have been my first choice but at this point i'm happy with anyone  that is  n overtime jason garrett. we know garrett stinks. no clue on judge. willing to withhold judgment. maybe he's great. maybe he stinks! but willing to let it play out
LockyLockerson,"o you are producer  will be sweating some big-time n against the spread futures tonight so if you have no rooting interest in the game send some positive vibes his way.   this fulfills my ""do one nice thing for eli"" part of the contract for the week."
LockyLockerson,i'm also n overtime going to become a huge michigan advocate or anything.  just interesting that michigan g overtime one game closer to winning the title and texas and washington grew much further away (and miami was eliminated altogether) yet none of that went michigan's way value-wise.
LockyLockerson,this doesn't mean to fade the other side either necessarily. just there's most likely no angle. this is a good example i can think of where bettors only remember a theme/trend/whatever when it wins and they ignore all the losses.  so those were some losses this week.
EliHershkovich,point is there's no reason to have doubts.  it is  a similar conce point  to any subscri point ion-based platform with written breakdowns etc.  it is  n overtime about touting any picks.  it is  about the information. he's one of the hardest working dudes in this industry.

DannyParkins,doug marrone has extensive background with tight ends and offensive line head coaching experience and won at syracuse with a greg robinson qb won in buffalo and won in jacksonville with blake bortles. id be interested in adding him to matt nagys staff. plus has saints ties.
DannyParkins,well hes a 3rd round rookie rb so playing him i have no problem with. the kick coverage thing feels like it was a pregame plan that maybe wasnt adjusted a free throw er he balled out on offense. just worth noting n overtime a huge deal.
DannyParkins,th against the spread true. i started off by saying i dont trust him. i think him going at brooke pryor today is another sign he isnt maturing or taking it seriously. heres the police report detailing physical injuries. i get it that fans are gonna stan.
DannyParkins,th against the spread the thing... they won the jimmy butler trade even though they did it a year late. lauri was a great pick at 7 even though they admitted they g overtime lucky bc he was better than they thought. theyve had some nice moves.
DannyParkins,well be doing a review on  today because l assit night was the first ever ep that    watched then a free throw er the show ill be recording an ho you are long podc assit with the other diehard thrones fans  what do we say to death?
DannyParkins,the only thing ill say about the bears schedule is it is a tier 1 patriots/cowboys/steelers esque schedule. three thursday games one monday two sunday night plus multiple 3:25 slates for nantz/buck number 1 broadc assit teams plus london plus thanksgiving. th against the spread no joke.
DannyParkins,eh wh against the spread the difference between 5 and 6 more hours of radio? couldnt fall asleep for a nap and les is on early so ill join him starting at 11pm instead of midnight. lets do this. (im paying off a bet for those confused)
DannyParkins,im off on previously scheduled paternity leave for the next week and have now been quoted by two people who cover the sports talk radio industry on how the format will program with no sports. i relish the opportunity. just entertain. already looking forward to being back.
chadmillman,"i'm a giver ask anyone

Gingfacekillah,i did something along those lines. i saw there was a program for lawyers where they could input case fact details and it would forec assit litigation success probabilities. tinkered with a negligence caselaw machine learning project for a bit. other than that i stick to sports.
Gingfacekillah,the spreadsheet i used for this article is available for you to download as well. you can use it to walk through the article or run  years old you are own experiments. contact  through the email provided at the bottom of the article or download it here:
Gingfacekillah,it is  n overtime substantively different from the nfl model i shared a while back. take a sh overtime working it out for yourself using that as a guide.  it is  better that way as i find you learn more from the mistakes than anything else. bol.
Gingfacekillah,some modelling work on the nba today with xgboost and rf. found some interesting features. xgb test predicting at 68 percent  rf test predicting at 92.9 percent . rf test is breaking the theoretical prediction ceiling for nba so i assume something is wrong. train test tweak.
logan_matthews9,i dont agree - besides the injured guys whos the best player whos n overtime in? alfredo morales (who was awful against mexico l assit window)? if you want to just bring in young guys okay i get that but deserving is n overtime the right word
logan_matthews9,we literally didnt qualify l assit time with plenty of those players. and again already placing him as the starter in 2022. no major countries in the world do that. plenty of players could develop faster than him. just let him do his thing and be patient
PikachuBets,craig. how else would you objectively measure  quantify upsets? sports is n overtime about betting sure. but it seems like you want sports to be about narratives n overtime numbers. if i'm biased towards betting doesn't  years old you are pov make you biased towards journalism narratives?
PikachuBets,fuck you. i g overtime a sheet in my bio all verifiable on twitter.  doesnt share anymore but also was publicly documented. n overtime sure where  record at but its out there somewhere. both are pros. you on the other hand still tweeting asian baseball totals. bozo
PikachuBets,"oh-hoh! shutting it down may n overtime have been his choice. but going on shameless pr blitzes plastering his face on social media everywhere being so arrogantly cocky that this would be so wildly profitable without ever considering ""what if it won't?"" were entirely his choices. lol"
adamchernoff,well he does n overtime have to. eagles built differently than the ravens. they have a significantly better passing qb great running between the tackles and are better at throwing out of heavy sets which is where the p against the spread struggle to defend opposing qb's.
adamchernoff,"in designing a gambling product experience location shop - anything - there are three main points that everything must revolve around.

speed
isolation
continuity

you will never ever find a gambling product that is successful which does n overtime hit all three of these out of park."
adamchernoff,low margin refers to the margins that the bookmaker has priced into their market. most will operate at 104.7 percent  (-110/-110 a side). others operate as low as 102.5 percent  (-105/-105 a side). lower margins and higher limits tend to attract larger bets from more influential players.
adamchernoff,spoke about this on the  podc assit late l assit night and how it could affect the price with bouye still on the injury report. very wild reaction from ramsey and the bench. i think there is a l overtime more to this story than being told.
adamchernoff,have n overtime thought about that one way or the other but i would put that in the same surface level info that doesn't apply to what plays out on the field especially considering the teams are playing with much bigger rosters than usual in the preseason.
adamchernoff,the park adjusted hits produces a final projected hits number. a regression is run on all games dating back to 2005 (34000 game sample size) to determine the most likely number of runs scored based on projected hits. both teams are combined to produce total expected runs.
adamchernoff,lobos have taken care of bottom quartile opponents but have been pummelled by upper talent. lowest pricing in terms of home field and the worst back line in the country. should be comfortable for the visiting offence to pin them back today. alt handicaps in play too.
Ccon8181,one of the benefits of paying more is to n overtime wait in line n overtime have to fly across country like a sardine but rather pay for first class. the whole point is to work  years old you are butt off to afford these benifits. crazy
Ccon8181,"some props im on personally. n overtime with the fund as limits are too tight. #props #superbowl53 

todd gurley over 32.5 receiving yards -160

julian edelman over 84.5 receiving yards -125

distance of longest punt patriots over 53.5 yards

chalky but + expected value sides imo. enjoy"
Ccon8181,that l assit touchdown by #toledo with 2 seconds le free throw  just cracked any early bettors who took the under 66.5 due to wind factor or those with early knowledge of #fiu qb injury looking to profit. the gambling gods would have none of it. #bahamasbowl
kellyinvegas,i played western michigan. th against the spread the thing with bowl contests. you have to pick weeks in advance. more info comes out a free throw er and  years old you are plays are frozen. im n overtime betting all of the games on the  graphic

12Xpert,yes  that is  basically how a market-making or sharp bookmaker operates. i believe it can be the case that some of these brands can offer opening lines to a selected groups of sharp players privately for limited stakes and this helps adjust the line towards greater efficiency.
12Xpert,i agree something feels n overtime quite right about refusing action. but writing a story about dc's salary as a means of criticising it rather than looking more analytically at the historical political and economic landscape of sport betting seems to me to be a bit pathetic.
12Xpert,"actually there is:

click on ""sports trading articles"" you will see a list of article sections. on each of those you can see a list of articles and they will show who the original publisher is e.g. pinnacle. at bottom of article you will find the author."
12Xpert,it is  n overtime really going to work with true kelly  that is  one of  it is  drawbacks. i'd use the initial balance for all simultaneous bets. that strictly makes it a mix of percentage and non-percentage staking and potentially riskier. therefore use a fractional kelly stake.
12Xpert,you behave as if you believe you think betting is n overtime almost completely random because you and a private group you know have made some money. have you actually bothered to count all the players and study their performances? n overtime just the ones you see.
12Xpert,"people and fans... are so sick and tired of drugs cheats. they have zero tolerance... so if you... have any connection with anything to do with doping they are done with you and  that is  just the way it is. athletes need to understand that.
micheal johnson"
12Xpert,that is  what they wanted. no other country will want to face it. ultimately it is a doomed project unless it federalises and becomes a single county with single fiscal policy defence strategy etc. etc. see what the germans say when they are faces with that reality.
12Xpert,i hope  it is  clear to the var refs too. i suspect it won't be but if they all argue it is clear despite contentious decisions i suspect they will sill be arguing precisely what it was that was clear to them. time will tell as always.

RufusPeabody,added game  college basketball  totals have $250 limits. n overtime hard to move those. i dont know if they are or arent moving lines. i just know mike thought somehow they could give out picks that had value without influencing prices which doesnt make logical sense
RufusPeabody,when i use yards/play my ypp number adjusts for field position down dist as well as game situation -- a team down 3 scores in the 4th quarter has a different baseline than one up 3 scores. it also de-weights garbage time. contextualization is so important.
RufusPeabody,important to note that being able to beat the sports betting market does n overtime mean you can best predict the outcome. it doesnt even mean youre better than the betting line. it means  years old you are predictions add *something* to the prediction. big difference.
RufusPeabody,the problem is every year i have to go back through my code and figure out what the hell i was doing and then try to get to the ideas i had for improvements the previous season.  it is  like re-learning a language every goddamn year.
RufusPeabody,yeah you dont have standings but you experience whether you dra free throw ed a good team every single day. when you have to order a turkey blt hold the turkey bread and lettuce youre gonna be cursing  years old you are dra free throw  strategy.

robpizzola,if we strip out the games where we think mahomes was n overtime 100 percent  this is a historically great kc team. reid is a great coach---certainly better than most in terms of game planning but he needs to leave the in-game decisions to someone else.
robpizzola,props are typically a much so free throw er market than full game lines or totals hence books are n overtime willing to take big bets. it is tough to get large sums of money down on any prop let alone an nhl prop (smaller market).
robpizzola,very likely that i'll be doing a periscope at some point tonight leading up to thursday night football. i have a good friend's wedding on saturday night so need to be realistic with the possibility of a sunday morning periscope which is close to zero percent.
robpizzola,for some reason which i have been unable to explain i have consistently outperformed that number in terms of actual roi. i'd say the edge is definitely decreasing year-to-year due to increase in coin flip games (overtime and shootout) but roi is still regularly  than clv.
robpizzola,danny im n overtime a heartless person. im n overtime sending these kids home crying. i have a good laugh with them get me to walk them through their costume... its all good natured. i was a child at one point too; im cognizant of that.
robpizzola,"there is no better follow for nhl content than 
 i can only imagine the effort it takes to put together the amount of quality content that he produces. i may n overtime always agree with his model's numbers but love the public transparency into his process."
RASPicks,agree some of the coach's against the spread  records are useless and there can be overreaction to them but i  daily fantasy sports  agree there is zero predictive value with certain head coach's approach to the games some of which are reflected in those same records.
RASPicks,is it impossible to make money buying picks from a service? do pros/syndicates ever buy picks from services?  what you write is generally good advice and buying picks certainly isn't beneficial to everyone but there have been and probably always will be notable exce point ions.
ProfessorShine,point spreads matter. if an angle identifies team x doing something situational it would help to see if the team is a fav 1-34-67+ or a dog at certain numbers.  a fav or dog less than 3 points is very different than 7+ dogs or favs.
ProfessorShine,setting up shop in nj was very smart and i said so.  i also think they missed a few good hires like    i think they could give  as a fulltime guest.  theyre afraid to delve into people that bet and it could be their future undoing.
suuma810,there is close to zero chance they will be better defensively. their 2018 outlier performance along with their 36 turnovers is n overtime sustainable. chi could still have a very good defense but going from an historical performance to a usual top-5 defense makes a difference.
suuma810,"some very important things i've learned about sports betting over the years:

1. closing line value matters.

2.  years old you are ability to evaluate teams only gets you as far as  years old you are ability to price them accurately.

3. understanding regression is key."
suuma810,expected p against the spread  jags both to struggle to move the ball. my total was 44. p against the spread struggled jags didn't. jags much better without force-feeding fournette best game i've seen from bortles. the fourth quarter touchdowns hurt but i'll take my loss.
ClevTA,such a genius take that u decided to pull his full season st against the spread n overtime just the games a free throw er freddie took over. 357 yards per game 8.4 ypa 6  touchdown  7 int vs hou kc and bal. all playoff tms.
ClevTA,huh? army went into oklahoma l assit year and took them to ot. has nothing to do with coaching. if u are choosing between an academy and any other small school program out of conference id never intentionally choose to face a triple o point ion
ClevTA,mcguire was quite terrible l assit year. jets had the worst adjusted line yards as an ol but he was 56th in  expected points added  and 49th in success rate among 56 rbs. by comp crow was 26th in  expected points added  behind that same ol

any bookmaker who complains about steam bettors is a dressmaker in disguise."
spanky,"lesson time.

you would think a handicapper having the best quants with sophisticated models using proprietary data could be good enough. i too believed in jambos.

handicappers are n overtime bettors. suggesting picks with no market awareness and awful closing line value yields to inevitable failure."
spanky,i hope to see sport lines being traded like other financial instruments. the worlds greatest trading institutions are able to evaluate stocks and buy low and sell high. they will eventually do the same with sport lines. achieving liquidity is only possible with enough big players
spanky,99.99 percent  of touts are scamming bullshitters.  is the .01 percent . he moves the market and doesnt front run his customers.  every bookmaker and sharp bettor respect ed. his reputation is flawless.  he is n overtime only super sharp but is a great guy.  respect
spanky,"betting partnerships and touting are very different. 

betting partners get me accounts i do all the betting and we share in the profits/losses. i am confident enough to put my own money up.

touting takes money from bettors with 0 percent  financial risk for the tout."
spanky,also given that  has many of its race books partake in the pari-mutual pool they should be required to go above and beyond to inform their customers that this is non pari-mutual location. regular guy seems william hill sign he thinks its all the same everywhere.
spanky,a dressmaker is a bookmaker by name only -who spends his time making dresses or trying on dresses rather than managing his book to maximize revenue utilizing all information from all types of customers. the monkeys that consistently move on air disgrace this very noble profession
spanky,lowering limits has become rare. its much easier for the joint to just kick the sharp player out.  i lose many accounts weekly with all my betting partners but the asians have this unbelievable ability to regenerate new accounts constantly. the asians run the gambling world.
spanky,so much negativity about this. this is entertainment tv guys. there is an inverse correlation between winning bettors and entertaining bettors.  winning bettors are usually n overtime the life of the cocktail party and would make for terrible television. there are exce point ions of course.
spanky,a few weeks ago many sportsbooks both offshore and in vegas refused to take action because don best was down.  in todays world most bookmakers are crippled without knowing where they stand vs the market.  very few if any have their own set of numbers.  (2/2)

PlusEVAnalytics,finally g overtime around to reading this thanks for sharing. i didnt really follow the logic of we have to bin everything because if we dont it would just look like a regression - why n overtime just do a regression then? what makes this better?
aluckyaday,agree with you. most recreational gamblers probably  daily fantasy sports  expect to win. but do they understand why they do it themselves? they may n overtime expect to win but i bet a large proportion hope to win. driven by the dopamine hit when they do.
aluckyaday,this results in local markets being dominated by so free throw  books. it is n overtime something that is going to change no matter how much people moan about it. there is no glass ceiling. just graduation from a local market to a global one. 2/2
aluckyaday,the other issue some have with nish is his lack of clv. personally i'm ok with that as my views on closing line value tend to differ from the likes of  . i think joseph is slowly begrudgingly moving in my direction on that one .

aluckyaday,my theory of why we have n overtime discovered any alien lifeforms is alive and well. once lifeforms have the ability to meet others they also have the ability to destroy themselves. reduces the probability of two lifeforms existing at the same time quite a bit!
aluckyaday,yes. o you are views are swayed by the circles we move in. this is why independent unbiased data is so important. but when it comes to emotive issues like gambling independence is hard to find. people seem to take a view one way or another.
aluckyaday,you are missing the point. the numbers are never going to get to a point where liquidity matches financial markets. the incentives to gamble (its zero sum less costs) are n overtime the same as the need to convert long term debt to short term liquidity.
aluckyaday,you think with mbl across the board you would still be able to bet at less than 100 percent  on a saturday? have bog? have all books offering early prices? mbl will stifle competition for recreational punters. can't see how it would be good for them.
aluckyaday,yep. another controversial view of mine is that sharps that can win at pinney's opening line are very different to sharps that can beat the close. at open pinney can be beaten by having better data than them lineup weather etc rather than a better model.
aluckyaday,well i thought it was quite an appropriate one! i'm confident (but cant be certain) that some professional gamblers have just hit the lottery  (via  survivorship bias). probably applies to poker more because of the bigger variance but sports bettors are n overtime immune to randomness.
aluckyaday,although this is an old argument as parliament voted to trigger article 50 which legally committed the uk to leave. so i guess at the moment the law is in line with the referendum and will leave with no deal unless they vote for something else!
aluckyaday,with gary's bet? if that is the case they i would stick to place betting his selections. depends how much the dopamine hit of a big price winner is worth. i guess for a l overtime of people that is as important as the monetary returns!
aluckyaday,"brings back memories especially the telkom sign. i used to do quite a bit of work for telkom at their cape town office. still can't believe the ""all guns must be le free throw  at rece point ion"" sign as you went through the security doors!"

LeeSharpeNFL,"this is why tanking in the nfl is hard outside of the gm deliberately making the roster bad.

the players are there to play. they are generally competitive people by nature. their next contracts depend on their ability to demonstrate how they can help teams win."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think it depends on the universe of questions you're examining.

analytics can tell you  it is  bad to punt on 1st down but obviously coaches already correctly knew that.

but of course all of the *interesting* discussions are finding spots where conventional wisdom is wrong."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think oak committed dpi there but it was pretty small and i am shocked it was overturned.

like romo said it feels super random. and  it is  always going to be. pi is super subjective. which is why it was never  reviewable before this year."
LeeSharpeNFL,"imagine the field has two numbering systems one treating goal a as 0 and goal b as 100 and the other is the reverse.

chadmillman,you may recall  wrote a story about how 10  years ago he predicted a 16 seed would beat a 1 seed by 2020. a friend disagreed. they wagered $10000 then lost touch. when umbc won a debate raged: should he try to collect. here's the resolution.
Gingfacekillah,i really like jason's work. his r  python ebooks are a great place to start learning through trial and error as they give you generic modelling process flow code that you can apply to whatever datasets you'd like. great resources for those interested in machine learning.
Gingfacekillah,one prop example that comes to mind is mitchell trubisky injuring his le free throw  shoulder on the first drive against the vikings. trubisky technically plays so props have action but all the main unders (passing yards passing attem points   touchdown  passes etc.) ended up hitting.
Gingfacekillah,"that is  a good question. a live betting line changing is generally a function of time winding down and new game state information. best you can do is compare to a model and forec assit an expected value. no ""closing line"" in that scenario per se."
Gingfacekillah,"many people think that the main psychological aspect of handicapping is about revenge factors etc. 

theyre n overtime wrong but of at le assit equal importance are the cognitive biases of the market itself. which of the two categories do you think are more predictable? explore."

Gingfacekillah,thanks! you're so right.  that is  what started this msc pursuit for me - i realized all rating systems are paired comparisons that use linear algebra matrices to derive their ratings. i realized i have to understand this process in order to formulate my own operations/equations.
Gingfacekillah,as weve seen in many of these research papers you have to extract what is useful and discard the parts they glossed over to make their research easier. usually they have a good idea or technique which they apply in questionable manner. errors and omissions abound.
Gingfacekillah,"""shin sees the flb as an asymmetric selection problem stemming from the presence of [sharps] who possess superior information. because of the presence of [sharps] books engineer a flb in order to pass the costs of losses arising from [sharp action] on to less informed bettors."""
Gingfacekillah,"poisson at its finest?

i see what you mean here. however which model mindset gets us closer to the truth of the underlying signal? some form xg based on xs percent  xshots xsave percent   with a poisson distribution and a standard error would be my vote."
Gingfacekillah,thanks for the feedback! using a logit model right now that infers latent team strength from game data...but while it has a good r squared it seems to lose to the vig. trying to find a solution to increase accuracy. maybe adding weight to recent games.

adamchernoff,mls markets have been influenced pretty heavily by xg all season. i think th against the spread the case here in the comparison. seattle one of the most over performing sides (3rd) in overall xg second most over performing on xga. atlanta very much under performing.
adamchernoff,it is just odds expressed in decimal format so it is easier to use and more universal. in us odds it converts to +115 so  years old you are price has moved just a tick but still worth the wager (just about 1 percent  worse pricing).

12Xpert,the problem is that with both pinny and exchange equally efficient but n overtime perfectly so for every price betting one when the other is lower may mean you are systematically betting the less accurate price on average hence the expected value is illusory only. (2/2)
12Xpert,compared to the closing average market prices i had a 13.3 percent  (minus margin) advantage. really was a no brainer for them despite my protestations. i was aggrieved that they accused me of arbing but really this amounts to the same thing over the longer term.
12Xpert,"i very much suspect that this distribution is just like betting performances. almost normal (i.e. luck) because there's a 'paradox-of-skill ""arms"" race' going on but there are a few who are geniuses and have real positive and meaningful alpha. i assume messi is in that category."
12Xpert,"interesting stat. any chance you could pl overtime a distribution of ln(goals/xg) for all goal scorers (say with more than 20 goals over 3 seasons to reduce variance) and see who the outliers are.
(might messi be an example of xg methodology being a one-size-doesn't-fit-all metric?)"
12Xpert,"daily fantasy sports  ask me ask them.

for what  it is  worth if you want better social care higher personal tax and national insurance allowances a properly funded nhs and free tv licences you either borrow more or you tax more or both.  that is  how."
12Xpert,with this sample it won't be enough with pinny odds. i should imagine like with most things you'll be able to make a profit from so free throw  books but only because one of them almost always has a better price designed to attract new customers.
12Xpert,"i can't make these bets i've been banned by most of the bookmakers that offer the odds. but others with more patience than me make find ""ways"" of prolonging the life of their so free throw  bookmaker accounts hence  that is  why i share this methodology."
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  care if they are fucking gods. the fact that the top 20 could print money (assuming they could  might say otherwise) doesn't change the hypothesis that betting performances look very similar to a random distribution if the other 10000 are tossing coins.
12Xpert,hence the subjectivity point in the case about whether the rule is a good one worth adhering to. i think clearly the scotland v argentina case illustrates the point. do we want football to become a game decided by techno nerds with a nanometer measuring stick?
12Xpert,as a bayesian i'm inclined to ascribe a higher probability to the second of these opinions until such time as data becomes available to suggest that the first is much more likely proving that bookies were actually doing that rather than this being just anecdotal hearsay.
12Xpert,i make available fixtures for anyone who does quantitative analysis on historical data to find systems that beat the bookmaker odds. from those systems they will output probability predictions for home draw and away. if those are more than the odds imply you have found value
12Xpert,... that my guess is wrong and they are n overtime efficient but the two together make it look like they are. the bayes in me suggest the latter is much less likely. but i'm merely highlighting the problem with trying to pin these things down.
12Xpert,pinny better. when i first investigated woc i used the market average and it just isnt useful presumably because most of what makes up the average are recreational bookmakers posting intentionally inefficient prices. th against the spread why i turned to pinny to do the job.
JambosPicks,subscriber feedback is indicating that users are having increasing difficulty acting on o you are exact recommendations due to rapid line movement.  we will continue to monitor in the coming weeks before making any decision on how to best move forward with o you are service.

mschwimer,"what doesnt add up is we are simply that good. but just saying that makes me sound like a shit tout. the problem is its the truth. 

i think the plan will be to go on a ton of reputable media stations and spread the word."
mschwimer,for clarification in high school my friends always joked with me because they thought i wanted to be the king of the world.  as i am sure you know rex mundi is latin for king of the world.  i do n overtime know about the comics.
mschwimer,the money that is filed comes from the lps. we are the gp and take 3 and 30. th against the spread where the income stream comes from. we are in many lines of business. subscri point ion company is the smallest line we are in.
mschwimer,all packages start on tuesday. latest to sign up is 5pm. i intentionally didnt include it as an o point ion because i didnt want people inadvertently signing up for next weeks 4 week package when they wanted picks immediately. the packages resurface at midnight tonight
mschwimer,point is. we are going to clean up the awful tout industry by being full transparent and financially accountable for o you are picks. we put o you are money where o you are mouth is. if we give you losing picks we will pay you.
mschwimer,we firmly disagree with that comment and its a l overtime messier.  we believe we can make a l overtime more money by doing this than betting ourselves. if a book guaranteed us $1m limits on every bet we wanted we would do that 100 percent
RufusPeabody,can i ask what number of followers has to do with it? if you're saying you want guests who have the most reach then i get  years old you are point. but if you want guests who provide the best insight twitter followers is irrelevant.
RufusPeabody,"teams with the most ""hidden yards"" (hidden by context) on offense in wk15: ny giants chiefs cardinals vikings and seahawks. bringing up the rear are the jets panthers dolphins chargers  bears who  daily fantasy sports  look as bad in the box score as they should."
RufusPeabody,the committees rankings l assit week (for baylor/minnesota) were such a d expected points added rture from anything in previous years that i have no idea how to handle it. we project baylor at #4. we will be wrong. my intuition says georgia gets it.
RufusPeabody,apparently i wasnt clear on this. i declined an offer of employment from big league advance. i spent some time with their team l assit fall trying to see if it was a good fit. i received $0 in compensation for any guidance i provided.
RufusPeabody,i agree with this. how someone deals with adversity is critical. my first full year betting baseball my partners and i made $900000 before the all-star break and then gave $700000 back. motivated me to work harder. i did n overtime want that feeling again.
RufusPeabody,new  up where  it is  just  and me. we recap o you are amazing jinxing prowess and use the nba to touch on outcome-based evaluation before talking about topics from twitter. then i nerd out on golf for a little bit while jeff patiently waits.
RufusPeabody,that is  a fair point. there are always exce point ions to rules but the exce point ions are rare enough in this case that i feel okay about speaking generally on the topic. do you disagree with the basic premise of my original tweet?
RufusPeabody,it is  outrageous that unless you traveled internationally or had close contact with someone who tested positive you can't get tested for #covid2019. medical professionals who show sym point oms should be required to be tested. we're putting so many people at risk right now.

SportsCheetah,aldridge missed 5 midrange jumpers and 1 corner 3 in the 4q including the  free throw  at the end of regulation that would have won them the game. he followed it up in  overtime with 3 more misses and splitting at the  free throw  line.
SportsCheetah,never won back-to-back before maybe ill start laying -1400s and ill have a shot. th against the spread why they pay him the big bucks... so he can put out plays that require you to risk 40 percent  more than the bankroll you even have.
SportsCheetah,walk-on had to get his bucket. hbu d just stopped and stood and watched since the game was over. then the announcers say the sh overtime counts a free throw er a small roar from the crowd and apparently guy buried one from full court.

capjack2000,mlb 2019 was awful. i gave up by late may. typically i bet apr-jun and then se point . the ball was a major factor. also the market is more efficient with regard to other angles now. probably wont bet main mlb sides/totals going forward.
capjack2000,"as players begin to realize this it will create an artificial ceiling as well as greatly reduce the number of high-margin futures markets and parlays they play. 

combine this with the lack of college betting and the oregon lottery has served itself a poison pill."
capjack2000,good question. its a good business school case study. they g overtime a first mover advantage in a new market and came in with a solid product that won favor with regulators. it was a brilliant move. anyone else would have trouble overcoming their inertia.
capjack2000,"exactly. if you're a recreational (or sharp) bettor the first step is to come to terms that beating the nfl is near impossible.

capjack2000,unfortunately there is little chance the ban on nj college betting will be repealed as it would take a constitutional amendment (via ball overtime referendum) to do so. the regulation that betting is n overtime allowed on nj colleges is baked into the state constitution.
RASPicks,call  and negotiate they give better deals than that!  in all seriousness i am sorry the service didn't work for you.  if ever want to try again with o you are latest release model dm me and i will set you up with a comp.
RASPicks,"there are exce point ions and many pro bettors do pay for picks.  reasons:  
1) line moves (middles/market timing)  
2) write-ups/info (they can filter)  
3) added volume/+ expected value (niche markets or markets/subsets they arent in)
4) they have the necessary resources (bankroll outs etc.)"
RASPicks,the evidence tells a different story.  winners can justify selling picks and thrive at it long term. winners even pros at the highest levels can find value in buying picks. with o you are current release model getting the release line or better is expected.
ProfessorShine,what is also lost as how easy it is to manipulate ones w-l records.  early lines vs close can be 2-5 percent  over a full season  college basketball  season. like saying u played jax st l assit night -9.5 when u know it was -10.

ClevTA,wrote about it here but the only legit qbs dallas has faced is rodgers and cousins. ill count darnold in a loss too but against rodgers and cousins both adams and thielen were out and they still lost both at home. brady should have success

CizzlingSports,". whole schtick is ""follow my picks and 'get rich kids'"" so i mean the lines kind of have to be wa when he gives them out especially given that he thumps his chest whenever one wins (even at a line no one reasonably got)"

spanky,everyone hates on  but hes a marketing expert. he may be a scammer but he doesnt force anyone to send him money. the true problem lies in societys tendency to look for easy solutions and purchase winners. the magnitude of degenerate sports gamblers is alarming.

spanky,a bookmaker/bettor relationship does n overtime need to be conflicting. every sportsbook both regulated and offshore use  lines to guide their own. they are the market line. they  daily fantasy sports  set the bar they are the bar.  for us sports no one is better
spanky,parlays can be a very valuable tool for the bettor.  people incorrectly assume parlays are sucker bets.  if you have an edge on a game parlays magnify that edge.there are still several shops that book cf correlated parlays. i personally utilize parlays to circumvent limits.(2/4)
spanky,i figured i'd share a few of my insights that may be enlightening to some... line shopping is critical and furthermore knowing how to compare two different lines is even more important....  for example in the nfl laying -2.5-130 is far better than laying -3-110.(1/4)
spanky,i appreciate  years old you are input and  daily fantasy sports  doubt anything you say.  however i am only interested in bettors.  i  daily fantasy sports  care if they tout or not.  they just have to bet and bet enough for the market to react.
spanky,and now   say they  daily fantasy sports  have any online limits and all bets are subject to approval.  this is a tactic to use sharps as a line service and air move.the offshore outs have been doing this as well.   is notorious for air moving.#itainteasy

aluckyaday,probably because the people who currently watch the sport  daily fantasy sports  bet/lose enough to fund it. until uk racing changes its funding model so it is n overtime beholden to bookmaker profits on racing bookmakers will control the sport. in the uk at least.

aluckyaday,the daily fail is a little late to this story! the guardian has been the most aggressive newspaper attacking gambling in the uk. although they both only give one side of the story. recreational books satisfy a demand that sharp n overtime restricting books can't.
aluckyaday,that is another advantage the europeans have. they are used to rolling out their products in different european countries each with different gambling regulations and taxation structure. each us state will be treated in a similar way to expanding in to a new eu country.

aluckyaday,exactly aspiring bettors can always get down. recreational betting is a different market. it is n overtime for players like yourself. do you moan about people playing roulette? recreational books do n overtime stop players graduating to sharp markets. they are pretty good training grounds.
aluckyaday,its their business let them run them how they want to! bet at the place with terms and conditions that suit you. imposing minimum limits would be detrimental to recreational bettors but favo you are line chasers. then again i guess you know that already
aluckyaday,only the bits relevant to my own disputes with operators and discussions with the gambling commission. to be honest they have been mainly to do with licence conditions rather than the gambling act. i guess you believe section 1 (c) is n overtime being applied?
aluckyaday,the acquisition costs of recreational punters is also very high they are very profitable once you get them but only if you can keep them. low margin exchange models do n overtime generate the profit that is needed to spend on acquisition and keeping recreationals.
aluckyaday,i disagree. the market will grow much much more under the european model. the key to growth is the recreational punter. so free throw  books are experts at giving them what they want. these guys are n overtime amateurs. they know what they are doing.
aluckyaday,certainly n overtime everyones cup of tea but i find james willoughby's insights fascinating. it is a shame his racing uk betting lab shows when it was more about understanding racing betting rather than the tipping show it became are n overtime available on demand.
aluckyaday,computer games are becoming a spectator sport. probably going to be a very profitable one. scale very well as you  daily fantasy sports  need stadiums or mountains! virtually unlimited number of spectators which means unlimited cash generation. which means big incentives to make it work!

chadmillman,why is that bad? digital media started w/bad model 20+  years ago chasing p-views w/diminishing returns since. users get clickbait lowest-common-denominator content  same stories that drive traffic. we want to play a more sustainable game. give it a try tell me if its worth it.

Gingfacekillah,thank you very much for the support of this project so far! i really appreciate it. i hope that this book can add something substantive to the sports betting community. i feel good about the chance to give back to #shar point witter and #gamblingtwitter
Gingfacekillah,to a certain extent yes. but high level analysis like that fails over the course of a season because over under get close to the 50/50 mark. betting market perce point ion of totals fluctuates game by game a deeper level of analysis is required.
Gingfacekillah,"as forecasted bky hangs a pounding  on a fatigued det team with a 28  point  mov.  a l overtime of people missed this because they were dazzled by the recency bias in dets h overtime shooting. bky cashes nicely. 

forecasted: bky -7.5
result: bky -28."
Gingfacekillah,safe to say mia is torched on this one. possible factors: 3 point  shooting variance in favo you are of tor and some difficulty on my part forecasting tor player minutes. going to take a look at the minutes and see where it went wrong.
logan_matthews9,"i choose one but basically gave a l overtime more weight to just raw talent numbers. 

the bigger issue is mid-tournament predictions. as golfers will have played different courses these numbers are almost guaranteed to be off. so my focus will be on pre-tournament bets"
logan_matthews9,"that doesnt make any sense. i normally use a third party for this type of thing but $50 isnt worth it for anyone besides you

well always have you implying that leach reaching the top 10 is 50/50. didnt know you were such a fan"

adamchernoff,"ok back to nfl week 11. 

first handicap of the week is up on the show this morning. 

continuing to work on my delivery and presentation and put context to each number i give out. any feedback on the episode this morning is greatly appreciated."
adamchernoff,continuity never has to be difficult in sports betting. this all comes back to the odds screen. everyone anywhere in the sports book always knows what the odds are when new prices (in-play/half) become available and exactly where to make the bet. announcements reenforce this.
adamchernoff,"almost one year ago i launched the simple handicap slack channel to allow bettors and listeners of the show to discuss betting on football monitor markets and ask betting questions in a ""mature"" environment. very proud that the community has now surpassed 300 members today."
adamchernoff,pretty sound approach. despite the results and all the preseason discussion and money being wagered only 3-4 teams in the league have seen any meaningful adjustment two due to wild circumstances a third a clear under price and the fourth the market didnt agree with.
adamchernoff,looking from a business perspective they have ~250 employees and a boat load of consultants. all of their grading is manual and requires 300-400 working hours per game. difficult to appeal to the mass market without something actionable to make up and cover all overhead.

ToddFuhrman,no doubt about it; if the public lost every bet they wouldn't continue to gamble.  it always entertains me that people expect you to be right 90 percent  of the time and if you lose a prime time game should be grounds for industry ex-communication
ToddFuhrman,"incase you missed it : l assit week  and i dropped the first installment of the   college football  preview series featuring deep dives of all the biggest programs from the b1g ten + pac 12 including  a best bet 

acc  big xii coming later today..."
ToddFuhrman,i have no problems for props figures etc do it  years old you are own way and i get that but when you have standardized betting index numbers that are easily checked on a  screen or other methods no need to reinvent the wheel imo
ToddFuhrman,i hate the transfer rule...however it should be contingent on the coach that recruited them leaving because otherwise all it takes is bags of cash (happens already) to create college sports free agency.  profit off likeness eh we  daily fantasy sports  need 7 figure handshakes
ToddFuhrman,"i never want to hear a damn thing about the ncaa and their push for ""integrity"" if this is even being considered

2nd chances are one thing but the opportunity to lead men 18-22 again a free throw er what transpired at baylor is criminal"
12Xpert,as always a little bit of transparancy from both sides of the argument would work wonders in explaining the status quo with respect to sports betting in the uk instead of denials from bookmakers and moral attacks on high earning ceos from those against gambling.
12Xpert,obviously we measure premier league greatness by the number of titles and man united walks away with it. but here's the league table for best ever consecutive 38-game points total in the premiership (so relegated and re-promoted teams carry over with the relegated period omitted)
12Xpert,of course if  years old you are odds are n overtime randomly distributed this might account for why you've had a longer than expected losing run. if you have a l overtime of long odds grouped together then obviously  that is  going to change things.
12Xpert,no that would be my explanation. perhaps then we need a tipster supermarket uses monitors odds slippage as a measure of skill (assuming you believe in clvh an idea i also been heavily criticised over). advertised tipsters could then be bought by single individuals. .
12Xpert,here's a pl overtime of t-scores which measure the performance deviation away from expectation over 50-bet samples in my wisdom of crowd history. they look pretty symmetrical and normally distributed to me. 67.8 percent  within +/-1 sigma 95.6 percent  within +/- 2 sigma of mean.
12Xpert,"i've rejected nothing and nobody that has been presented to me an properly scientific rigorous matter. i will reject people like you that just vomits anecdotal nonsense like ""you have to include him because he was good."" do some fucking science or just fuck off."
12Xpert,only ireland held a referendum on the terms of the lisbon treaty. the eu does n overtime require any member country to hold a referendum to approve membership or as part of treaty ratification. that is unacce point able and undemocratic. it should be mandatory.
12Xpert,"before anyone remarks we haven't le free throw  yet these foerc assits were for the two years following a vote to leave and assumed a bilateral trade agreement with the eu would have been negotiated.

why on earth would anyone bother listening to an economist?"
12Xpert,so in the 1960s when surface temperature records were showing cooling scientists started to wonder if we where heading towards the next ice age. then in the 70s we realised the increase in greenhouse gases due to industrialisation could in theory cause a global warming.
12Xpert,of course some people like jeremy corbyn aren't particularly keen on free trade anyway since it allows global multinationals to exploit uk workers and tax payers. i also seem to remember gordon brown arguing for british jobs for british workers. much easier if you're out.
12Xpert,it actually exploded with the internet 20 years ago. certainly  it is  a fair point to say that mobile technology and in-play advertising has mushroomed in the l assit few years with the potential for more harm but that is why regulation is addressing that.
12Xpert,combining the records gives p-value = 0.008. but really we should apply a bonferroni correction so alpha = 0.005 hence no significance. if we take alpha as 0.05/0.025 then the significance is weak at best and still non existent for the spreads on their own.
12Xpert,the de-tagging of older referrals might have been deliberate from what i can gather from this. could you confirm.  years old you are aff. prog. certainly never told affiliates about this. it would be in breach of  years old you are existing affiliate programme tcs.
12Xpert,retrospective pattern spotting is charting/technical analysis and i thought anyone who was serious about betting/investing knew that this is akin to alchemy. mai's selling stuff so when someone puts it to him that his stuff is luck the onus is on him to prove otherwise
mschwimer,had 1 goal when started.  to provide financial value for o you are subscribers.  even though o you are picks are going much worse than we anticipated we are still achieving o you are goal. please understand these numbers are extremely volatile and change constantly.
mschwimer,you should ask  he has seen every play from the very beginning. and maybe you dont know what filing form d with the sec means. it means if we dont pay back myself and all my partners are breaching the contract and breaking the law.
mschwimer,if you actually believe this buy o you are system and take my money!  im giving you 2.3-1 odds!  but we both know you dont believe a word you say. and with that im calling it a night. been a long day at the office.
mschwimer,subscribers can do whatever they want. if they want to play the recs great. if n overtime no problem. zero conflict of interest as we are fully financially aligned with the subscriber. we only want to give o you are winning plays in every scenario.
mschwimer,how can you possibly get a better bet than 2.3-1 odds. you have yet to come up with one single reason as to why you wouldnt take this. it makes no logical sense. unless of course you dont believe a word of what you say.
mschwimer,but most importantly. if you really believe what you are saying then put  years old you are money where  years old you are mouth is. you get 10k if you are right and only lose 3k if you are wrong. why wouldnt you do this?
RufusPeabody,what im saying is there are n overtime people out there worth fading. im sure there are a few ppl hitting 45 percent  over a large sample of picks but th against the spread n overtime because theyre 45 percent  fundamentally; its entirely randomness.
RufusPeabody,but you still wouldn't solve the vegas dave problem -- slick marketers preying on newbies who  daily fantasy sports  understand irreducible uncertainty (the fact that picking 75 percent  winners just isn't possible long-term). vd wouldn't sign on. and newbies wouldn't know of the monitor.
SportsCheetah,honestly those types of guys still probably g overtime it but freak out anyway. happened yesterday when wyoming won but utah lost. took all of the heat for the l. even this guy mentioned utah from daily wager and le free throw  wyoming out.

capjack2000,"sorry but  years old you are tired rhetoric can't be used on this one.  it is  indefensible.

robpizzola,um you do realize that the packers never led the lions at any point in either of their two games until the game went final. if you rate the packers well above the lions  years old you are list is useless and a joke!
robpizzola,payton fucked up plain and simple. you dont run a fake punt on 4th  18 unless you think pi is on the table. hell say a free throw er the game that it should have been holding but that was a piss poor decision.
robpizzola,the patriots have beaten three shitty teams; two of the three by much larger margins than the market believed. and quarterback play wont be an issue for them since they have the  and they dont need their head coach to read defenses for them.
robpizzola,at the end of the day golden state outscored toronto by 36 points from three-point range and the game came down to the l assit possession. it absolutely sucks to lose in that fashion but we still have two shots to get it done.
VegasRefund,nevada is a popular future im seeing  a l overtime of people on.. theyre legit but at around 9/1 when they realistically should be much higher has eliminated any value imo due to their public perce point ion rolling over from l assit season.
suuma810,the colts run game was working for the most part and they didnt create many negative plays. texans killed some drives with their runs despite the passing game had been quite effective. fell behind on almost every first down run with exce point ions.
suuma810,i trust the cowboys more than the eagles. philly too much banged up on defense  their o just isn't clicking. boys carry all the momentum three days extra rest (thursday vs monday) zeke should go off and cooper is a mismatch for that secondary.
ClevTA,rams were -1.5/2 on the lookahead just l assit week so a 3/3.5  point  swing only based on one bad gm  no injury is a healthy flip. maybe its valid but the perce point ion has definitely changed very quickly is all im saying

aluckyaday,arn't foxbet owned by stars? they seem to be running the same model as skybet in the uk. use the name of the broadcaster lots of sports celebrity promotions. in the uk they are so free throw . or as  would say a dressmaker!

aluckyaday,most st against the spread are descri point ive n overtime predictive. they tell you what happened in the p assit n overtime what will happen in the future. inferential statistics are what you should be looking at n overtime descri point ive ones...
aluckyaday,they have better so free throw ware. it just manages that risk differently. restricting customers rather than changing prices. whatever they say sharp syndicates are n overtime the kind of business they want. the information they provide can be obtained elsewhere at lower cost.
aluckyaday,"but they did n overtime cut the stakes to 20p because of evidence showing ""anyone can get addicted to gambling its inherently addictive"" as you claimed. they cut the stakes because the more a vulnerable person can stake the more harm it can do."
aluckyaday,profiting from sports betting is really hard if trying to do it from knowing about sports/players. there are always people that know more than you and the price is determined by them. it is easier to profit by knowing more about sports betting itself
aluckyaday,but if there is no square money on the exchange and they can only bet on the exchange how can they both win long term? square money pays for everything whether you are an exchange or a traditional book without it you will fail.
aluckyaday,yep. a l overtime of people seem to miss the fact that prices and terms and conditions are linked. different terms and conditions results in different prices. if you want a book that does n overtime restrict you have to play at sharper prices.
aluckyaday,actual profits are all well and good but they can be very misleading. especially if drilling down reducing sample size. do you provide any significance statistics along with the actual return? p-values would help but then i guess most wont know what they are!
aluckyaday,exactly. neither have i but it was a theoretical paper. n overtime done the math but if it happened i would guess anyone betting full kelly would have doubled their bet by then. it was n overtime 20 bets it was 20 winning bets!
aluckyaday,but are you trying to maximize  years old you are bankroll over an infinite number of bets? or make an steady income from betting? if you are taking profits and resetting  years old you are bankroll is kelly still the best o point ion?
aluckyaday,guess its hard to admit the model you have come up with may be pants! having the same problem with my first attem point  at a machine learning model. cross validation looks great.... test set n overtime so good  back to the drawing board!
aluckyaday,so you can answer questions on simon's behalf? what do you think of  years old you are teams decision to start you in the middle of forec assit thunderstorms tomorrow when  years old you are main rivals for gc are starting in the sunshine?
aluckyaday,i think the difference is for the less reputable tipsters variance is one of the tools of the trade used to attract followers. tipsters like it pro punters  daily fantasy sports . my roi so far this year is 81.17 percent  by the way

EdMillerPoker,we also of course have a full schedule of real in-play games today also where we make n overtime just hal free throw ime lines but lines at every timeout. if you're booking or betting today you should definitely keep a tab open to
EdMillerPoker,"for that you need good trained people systems it infrastructure etc.  that is  the part we're ramping up right now.

now o you are long-term goal is to be a lines provider for sportsbooks but we have a shorter-term goal also which is education."
EdMillerPoker,"to be specific the ""time between plays"" as of 2019 as defined as the time between when the data feed confirms the gamestate and that ball is dead and and the next snap of the ball is typically 0-5 seconds for an nfl game."
EdMillerPoker,o you are in-play baseball is a finished product but we decided to mothball it this year bc of the workload and we can really use the 6 months for other stuff. hope that decision doesnt put us behind too far for next season.
EdMillerPoker,the in-play streaming thing is the killer app. other differentiator is bet365 will do in house what others will outsource. that cuts both ways. i  daily fantasy sports  think bet365 is a favorite to have the class infrastructure in us but maybe i'm naive.
EdMillerPoker,fair enough tho amazon has so much market share these days i think the distinction is less important. if you can sell copies on amazon you'll have a l overtime more leverage getting the book into bm retailers and/or with an eventual publishing deal.

nonrandomalpha,judging performance by exclusively w-l is also n overtime a fair metric in o you are opinion. it completely omits and ignores the skill of position sizing. in addition reporting risk in conjunction with perf is equally powerful if n overtime even more so.
nonrandomalpha,you should also benchmark  years old you are total return performance v industry alternatives. this relative performance is huge when advertising the efficacy of  years old you are strategy to potential subscribers. we do this and n overtime sure why all do not. cheers!

JoeyKnish22,coinbase has terms against gambling. i havent heard ppl having issues recently but years ago they used to suspend/ban accounts for that. if possible you should use an intermediary web wallet to transfer to offshore books and n overtime do it directly from coinbase.
TheKostos,one nba player prop for tonight i really like. malcolm brogdon has struggled big time recently for the pacers. he's due for some positive #regression (cc:  with oladpio looking shaky to play i think brogdon goes for 20+. his points over under is 15.5.
TheKostos,as crazy as it sounds i think my favorite game of the eli era is the 2007 nfc title game at lambeau. part of me still can't believe they won that game.  it is  honestly more stunning to me than beating the 18-0 patriots.
TheKostos,my yankees tweets are definitely n overtime based in reality i admit that and have always admitted that. but you'd be hard pressed to find someone  that is  more critical and fair about the giants as i am. i've always been honest about that
LockyLockerson,conference futures were way more of a mixed bag but with both aac finalists utah hawaii and louisiana there were big prices plenty of opportunity to hedge if you wanted to go that route.  n overtime at all upset with how those turned out.
LockyLockerson,"my bets aren't flat they are based on what i think my edge is...the purpose of this is really just ""here are a ton of things still around i think are valuable.""  usually a shorter list.  bet whatever you want! you have total freedom."
LockyLockerson,i think on here i went like 3-5-1 but hit a pretty huge  moneyline with buffalo? i would argue every week is a great time to hammer the slate but  that is  because i am the one actually hammering the slate and betting these.
LockyLockerson,it doesn't necessarily create value it just explains why the market has shi free throw ed so much.  sometimes that level of movement proves to be correct and indicative of who the teams are.  just depends on the specific teams involved and the background.

Gingfacekillah,is a very smart guy. what i particularly appreciate is the desire to o point imize for median over mean bankroll as it accounts for risk of ruin which the mean can obfuscate. at le assit  that is  what i g overtime from it.
Gingfacekillah,appreciate the vote of confidence! i have a new-found respect for authors - producing a book that is reasonably coherent and succinct is a substantial undertaking. can't say for sure that i'd do it again. my current methods are something i'd rather keep quiet.
Gingfacekillah,i said something similar on the  podcast. i probably get 3 decent models for every 100 ideas i try. the differentiator isnt success rate its a high tolerance for failure the willingness to learn from it and the enthusiasm to try again more intelligently.
Gingfacekillah,sure did. i watched the game. he had every chance to hit the over but his usage  percent  does have a higher fluctuation based on opponent played than most. either way looked good. id take that pick at 2.00+ against most opponents for adams.
Gingfacekillah,because a team knows the players will play and compete they are forced to restrict minutes to execute an effective tank. see memphis l assit year. marc gasol had severely restricted minutes down the stretch. sat out 3rd and 4th qs down the stretch.
Gingfacekillah,journeyman electrician n overtime an electrical engineering degree. undergrad social science redseal journeyman electrician with top of class marks (~94 percent ). my basic algebra + trig are excellent. have been teaching myself linear algebra and calculus to try and fill in the gaps.
Gingfacekillah,tomorrow's game. combination of models with a zc poisson to balance out the draw odds. system likes the draw for tomorrow. hold out test currently 3-6 (33.3 percent ) and +1 unit a free throw er today so take with a grain of salt.

so far today. will be interesting to see what else pops up this a free throw ernoon three different games without active lines right now"
PikachuBets,actually cp has a year on me in terms of being active on reddit only i'm done with that cesspool now. he also has about a decade on me for being a degen motherfucker since i  daily fantasy sports  chase and he does ;)
PikachuBets,then dont fucking say id lay -800 when youre n overtime willing to lay jack shit. you started this argument n overtime me. so fuck off with  years old you are high horse now that you realize im calling  years old you are bluff
PikachuBets,because yes 3 successful black politics prove the system is n overtime rigged! no ones out there buying school admissions job offers or bribes or anything...no no n overtime at all. america is a 100 percent  merit based society cmon everyone knows that. lol
PikachuBets,its the right direction for a media guy like him. investors know this. smart analysis is boring to people without a frontal lobe so it would never sell big. look at the average nfl fan and imagine him learning anything mathematical. a joke lol
PikachuBets,imagine being a $25 tout for 2 yrs. then imagine hustling for $50 free plays. then imagine bragging about how good  years old you are stuff is. then above all that imagine...living in alabama. imagine living this hilariously fraudulent life. twitter toutin' ain't easy!
adamchernoff,yep good point about the d. comes down to the guys upfront on the ol for sure where they are lacking. tough to find great pass blocking in the deep passing scheme that keeps the ball in winston's hands for so long each snap.
adamchernoff,debated about the backdrop. the two looks in the industry are a wooden bookshelf filled with books to make the speaker look intelligent or a screen with logos to promote. neither look is me. but i agree i need to find something that fits.
adamchernoff,im canadian so i probably shouldnt know this but chicago is called the windy city because politicians in the 20-30s talked a l overtime n overtime because there is actually more wind in the city  on a daily basis than elsewhere in the country.
adamchernoff,at this point there are likely questions about service. service is absolutely important but if you nail the other three aspects then phenomenal service becomes a bi-product of speed isolation and continuity (with attitude of the worker mixed in which stems from the culture).
adamchernoff,very true. but if andy keeps peppering this early numbers that cause steam play alerts on the screen and suddenly has a hankering to roll with his lookalike in kliff kingsbury that game might close -2.5 off the podc assit and account influence alone.
adamchernoff,slate and being tunnelvisioned on one or two spots. charting all five buckets per game n overtime only gives you better insight into what is happening but also tells you where you might be missing something (stats/analytical) vs (situation/recreational). highly encourage all to try.
adamchernoff,still probably need at le assit $1m+ for data feeds developing so free throw ware certification staffing support and payments n overtime accounting for float (n overtime sure what mandatory minimum is) just to be competitive. good to see numbers coming down though slowly.
adamchernoff,"professionals work relentless on defining an edge as the more accurately an edge can be defined the more efficient staking will become. professional bettors tend to ask ""what is the probability of this outcome occurring"" rather than thinking ""i think this team will win""."
adamchernoff,the simple handicap mindset was built on breaking down bets to the most basic matchups. it is amazing how many bettors try handicap at a high level but pay no attention to the basics and accumulate knowledge. here is how you can change that:
adamchernoff,"one bet one win. readers of my blog for  cash in on philadelphia dallas over 43 returning 1.00x profit. handicap held true word for word even with the two teams taking 52 minutes to take advantage of the collective mismatch. 

good win for all."
Ccon8181,when  years old you are the worst team in the league by 2 games playing the 2nd worst team trailing by 14 with first and goal from the 2. why n overtime settle for 3  because you know it matters lol clown show #bengals

Ccon8181,wow #tcu outright loser. no bowl game. gary patterson has to be on the h overtime seat. cant win with the philosophy of defense and special teams in todays football. hed make a great defensive coordinator. horrible head coach and tcu has some talent.
Ccon8181,#browns just missed as a play. despite a tough week l assit week have to stay down and n overtime force it. n overtime going to lie i dont mind passing bon the browns... although that means theyll prob cover. # thursday night football
Ccon8181,this is the rodney hood i expected to be a key addition for the #cavaliers .. he was solid in utah but he didnt fit in with the hero ball style of playing in #cle . glad to see him excel in portland. #porvsgsw
Ccon8181,over the course of his tenure ive burned through at le assit 50k (being conservative) backing the #browns with highly inflated lines. the ways in which they crushed me should go down in the sportsbetting hall of shame. chao hue you wont be missed

12Xpert,here's the cumulative percentage losses for 40500 sports bettors over a 9 month period in 2005 ranked by player losses. 50 percent  of the losses come from 2 percent  of the players. data source and paper is fully referenced in my l assit book.
12Xpert,"main leagues fixtures for 26th and 27th december available:

i've omitted 2 friday evening fixtures (besiktas v genclerbirligi and dundee u touchdown  v dundee) since these are part of the next round of weekend games and they will be available as normal friday pm."
12Xpert,more people need to learn how to be able to hold two conflicting points of view (that can be formed from the same data) in their mind at the same time without suffering the usual cognitive dissonance. it will breed greater tolerance of others.
12Xpert,appreciated although  daily fantasy sports  forget i'm still a leech living off the losses of people who  daily fantasy sports  listen. that must presumably make me a hypocrite. i'll take that. better that wishing people died. (shit i can't write today 3rd time lucky.)
12Xpert,that is  true and i will concede that chebysh expected value offers some useful boundaries but with regards the pyckio tipsters it looked almost the same as normal so i think it would be unfair to simply through it out and replace with chebyshev.
12Xpert,yes i'd say the same about every human behaviour. you can't take an outcome and infer that the person made it happen. that is turning causality on its head. instead you should study what the person is doing and see what the consequences are.
12Xpert,scam ale: gotta hand it to this site for the brazen attem point  to defraud people. looks like  it is  run by an english trio in eastbourne but the map is somewhere in mexico city and the phone number is fake and doesn't work.
12Xpert,for the majority of that as a peace project (great idea) and an trading agreement (great idea). since the single currency  it is  become more strained. single currencies can only properly work imo with single fiscal policies and that means having one nation effectively.
12Xpert,"""there's a $100 bill on the ground!""
""can't be. if there was somebody would have already picked it up.""

regards fading what makes people believe any systematic bias betting against the square money sits outside of the vig boundaries? (see the economist's joke above.)"
12Xpert,particularly maddening because they breached their own tcs by n overtime telling they had done this when they should but still withholding  years old you are account balance. i suppose some might call this business. i might consider calling it the free throw .
12Xpert,that would be unreasonably high. but remember for 1x2 there are three possible opportunities for an arb to arise so in fact the total number of possible opportunities was 3 x 50210 matches = 150630. so 16861 as a proportion is 11.2 percent .
12Xpert,"thanks we have a dialogue channel. with regard to #betregret campaign i read it was ""developed a free throw er extensive research consultations with academic experts and several waves of focus groups with frequent sports bettors."" any published references you can direct me to?"

mschwimer,no because then o you are subscribers will be furious with me. they want to know where to find the best lines. the majority of o you are subscribers are recreational betters with multiple apps. so they go on the app that i cite.
mschwimer,talk to any accountant. extemely strict rules. they look at each play individually. check to see if the line was available at the book that was cited. then grade results independently. its why touts dont do this. because legit accounting firms live on credibility.
RufusPeabody,provide an outlet for bettors who feel they were mistreated (whether illegal or not) by legal books to file reports. create a repository that we can use to better understand issues bettors are having. what books are misbehaving? use this to influence legislation.
RufusPeabody,youre missing my point entirely. the point is there is would-be action th against the spread been limited/banned that a book could balance. this is a small slice of the pie th against the spread being underserved. th against the spread my point.
RufusPeabody,it takes a l overtime of skill to win at 55 percent   it is  n overtime simply taking advantage of market biases.  it is  modeling the proper decay in a skill over time; n overtime sure what the converse of that would be.
RufusPeabody,this is a problem endemic to selling picks. if the picks are good pros/syndicates buy them and have bots hitting them moving lines instantaneously. average joe gets worse price and doesnt win. (also many touts quote stale or n overtime widely available lines)
jeffma,this never had anything to do with whether you can pick winners (which i really dont care if you can or cant) it has everything to do with you touting a very flawed betting strategy and trying to explain it with flawed logic
jeffma,hard for me to criticize a manager any time he takes a starter out a free throw er hes been through lineup 2.67 times and you only need to get 6 outs with  years old you are bullpen and leverage is still high
SportsCheetah,i believe it was the clippers that did this recently in the 4q and forced russ to sho overtime or make the decisions every trip. and then pat b expected value did one of the greatest russ impressions this planet has ever seen.

SportsCheetah,rockets-clippers unders about to lose something like a 113 in final 19  minutes of this game. all but 2 of the misses in the l assit 16  minutes were either fouls resulting in  free throw s for the defense or orebs for points.
capjack2000,"i think aml/kyc concerns make it tricky n overtime the wire act. there are many syndicates and hedge fund guys wanting to make markets on sportsbetting exchanges.

capjack2000,"there is a structure for a very tightly scrutinized license approval process. it'll remain to be seen how strict they are.

capjack2000,"addabbo is extrapolating kip levins comments about fanduel handle made back in march at sloan.

what they g overtime wrong:
everything else."

capjack2000,the over-arching problem is that once  years old you are limits are lowered on those props they're lowered on everything. whether you have an edge or not. for instance if i try to bet the reds at +170 in that game for $500:
dinkinc,am i a bad person for feeling sorry for don cherry ?  i know its a bad take but i always saw him as archie bunker n overtime as donald trump. intentions have to matter at le assit a little ... maybe ??

dinkinc,i am okay with  and  comedy.. i was less okay with  years old you are race baiting by bring the gangstas to smokey mountain because that could have turned ugly and dangerous. anything that draws means people like it.. good for the business

DocBettor,a better way to handle bonuses would be to only offer them to eligible customers. that emails a generous notification in a way because  probably couldve just disabled the account from promotions completely which is what plenty of other places do without warning.
PlusEVAnalytics,ugh. think about whether something could conceivably have a real world impact on what youre predicting before you put it in  years old you are model. artificial intelligence is great but a little natural intelligence goes a long way to help it out.
PlusEVAnalytics,totally agree. now what is the source of the power imbalance? homogeneity of (generally unskilled) labor and barriers to job switching (think one factory towns). these things exist more in some times/places/industries and less in others. where do content creators in 2019 fit?
PlusEVAnalytics,if the market is moving on  years old you are action th against the spread a different problem - you could be creating  years old you are own closing line value regardless of whether  years old you are bets are any good :)

aluckyaday,investors are happy? i wonder if those investors have considered how and when they are actually going to get a return on their investment. even if the models are successful scaling to get a significant return is going to be a huge issue.
aluckyaday,well if you have an edge you still get the compounding effect traded for variance just n overtime the freebie on top. for random bettors without an edge its a very fucky bet as they get bigger negative expected value and more variance!
aluckyaday,n overtime necessary but n overtime having one means having to operate in a way that restricts book profits in an online world. legalised gambling does n overtime exist to enable sharp punters to make money. it exists solely to generate tax revenue.
aluckyaday,n overtime a great advert for their other revenue streams if the sports betting is a failure! according to the original article they are doing this to prove their models as it looks like they did n overtime get their original target business
aluckyaday,"interesting. i wonder how it will operate across regulatory borders. will bets go back to a single ""exchange"" on which hanson are the sole market makers or will they all go back to the smarkets current exchange allowing europeans to lay american bets"
aluckyaday,those parlay loving 8 beers deep squares that you refer to are the ones that pay for everything. sharps profits plus operator running costs. if an exchange can n overtime attract enough of them to cover their costs and pay sharps they fail.
aluckyaday,because i thought you might do a proper analysis of his results. if you are serious about proving his ability you need to look at price movements and how likely over the long term his results are to occ you are by chance.
aluckyaday,in this scenario touts can be useful for recreational players who can place the bets that touts themselves can't. touting becomes a way of realizing value in markets where you can n overtime bet. horse racing being a prime example in the uk
joeytunes2,"the 5 year anniversary tha put

EdMillerPoker,every country has a domestic league that im sure in that market gets a very relevant  percent age of handle. if you compare europe to us as roughly equivalent markets im certain breadth of coverage for long tail events is considerably more relevant.
EdMillerPoker,"as soon as you know someone will lie to further their interests  it is  n overtime constructive to invite them to a

EdMillerPoker,i mean i just found this chart on wikipedia. if you cherrypick  years old you are endpoints and squint then i guess youre mostly right exce point  for one or two age brackets. its the processed food!! still feels like total bullshit tho...
EdMillerPoker,maybe this sounds delusional but i honestly think if everyone involved in us sports betting from any angle -- bettor operator legislator lobbyist media leagues everyone -- just stopped and read this book this week we'd be on the right track next week
EdMillerPoker,most of all of that lives either in europe or offshore at the moment and most of it is held together with bubble gum and duct tape. one large state with friendly regs could take over as national center for all of it.
EdMillerPoker,in general i think having a following is a personal red flag. for the most part having followers only happens when you spend considerable effort cultivating followers. and most of the reasons someone would spend time and effort on that are pretty meh.
EdMillerPoker,beyond that the whole industry is held together with bubble gum and duct tape and  that is  what you're seeing. once the infrastructure gets built out dynamics will change. tho 9 figures on branding will go a long way for a long time.

reviewing  preseason personnel groupings analysis looks like gb finally gets it"
LeeSharpeNFL,i think  it is  more that the dra free throw  is super high variance than teams are particularly good/bad. n overtime saying  it is  n overtime a skill but i suspect skill differences among teams are smaller than variance on a typical player.
LeeSharpeNFL,i feel bad for chris ballard frank reich and the colts. i blame andrew luck absolutely n overtime at all for retiring he has to decide what is best for his life. but that really put a huge dent in this team's aspirations.
LeeSharpeNFL,"lions have 2:18 le free throw  down 7 commit opi on 4th and 1 to instead have 4th and 11.

they correctly went for it but they wouldn't have had to if they had gone for it earlier on far less ambitious spots."
LeeSharpeNFL,"updated my code for updating nflscrapr!

- new column ""cp"" showing the completion probability pass using  formula
- new function for easily adding team color and logo
- now saves a free throw er every game is parsed to minimize reloads on error."
whale_capper,there are a l overtime of guys you can cross off that list luck is n overtime one of them... they will need to secure a top 2 seed for him to get consideration but he has a legit sh overtime if healthy
whale_capper,this time l assit year he was creating 20 to 30c middles in mature markets per tweet... faster growth and more engagement than ive ever seen on gambling social media... that this translated into overconfidence is the le assit surprising thing about this
AndyMSFW,i suppose the mlb version of a mid-major model would be just predicting all the outcomes for orioles games?  seriously though i'm working on something and will try to figure out a way to make a little spending money on baseball this summer.
AndyMSFW,"yeah i guess i'm just saying that a handicap is usually fairly accurate over the long term and i  daily fantasy sports  think there is some ""sweet spot"" on the scale of spreads.  dogs of 7-11 points cover... 49.9 percent  of the time"
JoeyKnish22,the first sportsbook social media account that turns into the wendys of social sports gambling and just starts annihilating followers will be far and away the favorite/most popular. its perfect humor and content for degens and wayyy better than 100 under bettor gifs
JoeyKnish22,"the long  touchdown  streak is over. 

am i sad? yes. 

do i regret putting the streak on the line with these 2 garbage teams? yes.

it is mostly  fault. also yes. 

but we are n overtime to be deterred. more bowls to come."
JoeyKnish22,so you didnt know what a pph was 9 months ago and went from that to being stiffed 13k eh? from one of the most reliable well known pph networks. care to elaborate or provide detail if youre gonna throw out wild claims?
JoeyKnish22,he doesnt do a l overtime of media but really enjoyed the  segment on the pod. you can see why  is building a great rep. legitimate professional betting background and now n overtime afraid of taking action opening new markets behind the counter.
JoeyKnish22,next up  and my guy  theyve g overtime a thanksgiving party prop sheet going. heres a link to the sheet and you can find the props under nfl thanksgiving party prop sheet in the nfl tab. very similar to super bowl prop sheets.
JoeyKnish22,"the chicago fire futures did n overtime work out as they finished as the only team to miss the playoffs with a + goal difference (fun!) but im on a canadian soccer heater so im adding:

toronto fc +2500 to win mls cup"
JoeyKnish22,"made literally 2 baseball bets all year. the red sox/yankees under in game 2 of the london series. and a stale rsw over on the padres a free throw er they signed machado. 

have i ever mentioned how much i fucking hate baseball?"
JoeyKnish22,the passing game is real. tempo/spread is real. they should then win easily the following 3 games to be at 5-0. and at first glance florida/mississippi state/alabama all look a tad bit worse than expected schedule doesnt appear as daunting as previously thought.
JoeyKnish22,i might be drinking too much early kool-aid and i almost never recommend national title bets at longer odds. but if you think lsu be against the spread texas this weekend (i do) lsu +3300 wont be around a free throw er saturday.
TheKostos,no one has the will to win of a greg jennings. broken leg and all going for the  touchdown  while up 22 in the closing seconds. a true goat and one of the central figures of the most best offenses in madden history
TheKostos,yes it probably is. lol. he's good enough to win a l overtime of games and get back to the playoff but i'd worry about him moving forward in big spots. he was horrendous tonight. but yes again the original tweet is #bad
TheKostos,"i need to be candid with everyone.

i *love* this.

i'm totally on board as a giants fan for this weekend.

forget dra free throw  picks forget chase young that ship has sailed.

 let us  knock the birds out of the playoffs baby."
TheKostos,another reason why you need to subscribe to  -- we've g overtime previews/picks of the following night's card in both nba and  college basketball  for you to check out in the am. wake up fire it up get the bets and win. easy!
LockyLockerson,i bricked the heisman because i couldn't come up with joe burrow despite the trail of breadcrumbs which ultimately led many smart people to bet him at long odds.  something for me to work on next year in addition to many other things!
LockyLockerson,wrote the nba a free throw ernoon update a little early today because my son's been napping for 2 hours and that means the a free throw ernoon might get...interesting.  thoughts on a big night in the league up at the patreon page!
LockyLockerson,tennessee will be the team that i grow some kind of weird infatuation with that lets me down and  that is  fine but at le assit they have a greater than 0 percent  chance of winning the title even if  it is  0.1.
EliHershkovich,"there's a sizable market overreaction post-luck's retirement  smart books have adjusted (i.e.  over under 7.5 wins).

* brissett acquired a week before '17 season
* colts' o-line was trash that year
* ebron campbell  funchess in the mix

i'd  indy +7.5 at chargers."
EliHershkovich,"i'm so so bullish on the terps this season. grabbed their 50-1 futures from the jump  they're around 25-1 at most books now.

turgeon's first go-around with a senior pg (cowan) another ball-handler in ayala smith is a floor-spacing bruiser  wiggins breakout on-deck."
DannyParkins,just g overtime out of the mitch and nagy press conference because they were the story of the game. woo boy theres a l overtime more questions than answers.  is gonna be the sp overtime for all  years old you are bears reaction.
DannyParkins,podc assit of 75 minutes of me with my good friend  talking about my radio career and philosophy working with mac spiegs kc almost getting fired gambling and a l overtime more. search on the mark podc assit if n overtime using itunes.
chadmillman,"i love this story: smart narrative w/one set of data: the super bowl odds for #kansascitychiefs  #sanfrancisco49ers from spring until now. well done  

( free throw r i take issue with first line: i had both teams to make it in pre-season pool.)"
Gingfacekillah,naturally mapping the  percent  of points scored to  years old you are target outcome will differ a bit by each sport and we're n overtime factoring in specific factors like starting pitcher here but it was fun to make this work in excel.
Gingfacekillah,in this example the model was classifying games at 70 percent  accuracy out of sample. with bookmaker accuracy at approximately 71 percent  or so the model in this example while initially appearing promising is 1 percent  below the average accuracy of the book/market.
Gingfacekillah,these aren't just  years old you are basic linear regression models either. we'll be using a number of stronger methods including something i consider fairly novel: ensemble modelling in excel. that and lots more inside. i think you're going to really enjoy it.
Gingfacekillah,i've been thinking it might be mitigated with an added factor in forec assits that accounts for 3pm standard deviation. if you've g overtime a team that has high variance on 3's then the 2.5  point  edge you've forecasted isn't nearly as confident.
Gingfacekillah,i was particularly interested in reading more about  years old you are application of the t test for performance analysis. o you are discussion of t-test vs z scores made me realize there was a serious gap in my knowledge that needs rectifying.
Gingfacekillah,analogously if a group of reasonably knowledgeable people warn someone of the statistical improbability of their claim and explain why and the recipient ignores this and fails to investigate further willful blindness could be satisfied. of course idiocy is n overtime a crime.
Gingfacekillah,"no the book doesnt mention it. but its what you want to do especially early in the season. drawing a conclusion about a distribution from a sample of 20 games isnt good data science. check out his video:



that should get you started."
Gingfacekillah,i projected cal 2.98 (51.39 percent ) / lak 2.84 (48.33 percent ) for this game. what do you think is the best way to measure an xg model's accuracy? r squared value sum of squared errors mean average error or something else?

logan_matthews9,i dont want to speak for rufus - but you are absolutely right that you can beat the sports market and have zero predictive capabilities. people create synthetic positions that cant lose all the time (people have mad entire careers out of it)
logan_matthews9,th against the spread why the development of the academies and usl pipeline is so vital. fc dallas has like eight guys under 21 who are playing for them and/or north texas. this entire u23 generation grew up in the development academy system
logan_matthews9,why does celtics twitter continue to respond to these trolls? they arent legitimate takes they just want to bash. celtics fans love (or at le assit should love) ainge and about 26 other teams would take them as their gm in a second
PikachuBets,"look i  daily fantasy sports  want to flame you for honestly trying to recommend someone but you just made me click on a ""tipster"" record sheet showing $25 unit size bets while selling 40/week packages. ffs they couldn't even keep the currency consistent"
PikachuBets,yeah and then i had alba berlin pk today from 2 days ago which moved to +2 and they crushed by 11 but i forg overtime to post bc i didnt know it was a morning game today lol. gambling gods no chill
PikachuBets,"i like the ones that won't get my lines rekt. i only bet these on pph.

i think  best of luck pretty good decent limits. heritage super cuck at $100. no idea beyond those.  daily fantasy sports  really use public offshore books anymore"
adamchernoff,did another book move earlier? check the time stamps. once passed basic steps you can begin to handicap from different viewpoints. teams with favourable numbers and on-field analysis in the matchup move early and quick. recreational narratives bleed slow over 3-4-5 days. this...
adamchernoff,nailed it on the head. they also have a coach that is one of the few people on earth that is able to disguise that fact - most of the time. what do you think holds up longer this season coaching or linemen?
adamchernoff,most bettors focus on the point spread and can't relate anything else. limits and immediate availability drive a l overtime of this but what an upside as a bookmaker to have the focus of the market on an arbitrary number rather than price/probability.

Ccon8181,this call goes against us 9 out of 10... the one time we need it. or just call incomplete pass. it goes for fumble and return to blow #titans cover at +3.5 ... another reminder why do i bet on this league #nfl
Ccon8181,#tcu changes quarterbacks benching robinson and whata ya know. back to back touchdown passes. been saying it since l assit year college game too f assit for robinson... which they made the switch for the texas tech game when i backed tcu. #tcuvsou
Ccon8181,since the repeal of papsa you have paddy power fan duel dra free throw  kings among others. greater competition leads to more outs. the quality of the outs- books is wh against the spread lacking right now. hope it improves in the future.
ToddFuhrman,appreciate the kind words but even o you are podc assit isnt for everyone because it assumes a baseline understanding of the space. either way with more states coming on board i think the way people watch sports is going to change significantly
ToddFuhrman,dvond...appreciate you being a loyal listener all these years.  when we give out the best bet we make sure the price is available at a number of shops; +3 (-120) was all over vegas and a few offshores most of thursday post release.

ToddFuhrman,good point living in fear of a tyrannical dictator with no o point ions the exact same thing as choosing to play a sport under scholarship.  n overtime sure how i missed all of these parallels so thank you for pointing them out
ToddFuhrman,"game on...  monday night football  week 4 is live with a full breakdown of #cinvspit + the good bad and ugly from week 4 with

ToddFuhrman,"thanks boys...appreciate the kind words as we know some folks treat gambling as a ""fun"" topic to discuss which is fine but for us  it is  about making every listener smarter and glad you hear the homework come through on air each show"
ToddFuhrman,eh i saw some issues with them against rice; vanilla or n overtime execution wasn't crisp so  it is  a wait and see approach at le assit for the next few weeks. definitely one of the more fascinating games this week at um
ToddFuhrman,i'll 2nd payne on the win total given some major concerns qb de point h wise if something happened to lawrence.  as for the grey i've definitely added some dealing with payne all these years but i'm also 20 years older than him
ToddFuhrman,will be one of the games sure to make the docket for the week 1 regular season podcast; this game will tell us an awful l overtime about both teams as bearc against the spread intent on competing for aac title this season
ToddFuhrman,"one of the most valuable pieces of advice for aspiring sports bettors is to be honest w/yourself

recognize strengths  weaknesses
keep accurate records by sport to determine profitability/edge
understand plenty of good bets lose and bad bets win; be leery of confirmation bias"

TheCousinSal,i dont know wh against the spread more impressive - that you possess enough knowledge to realize that 4.3 is a great 40 time or that youre making show bets during an off week. the assit ros are laughing at you right now.
12Xpert,"because by ""winners"" and ""efficiency"" i am talking about markets set by the likes of pinnacle. the recreational bookmakers are far more inefficient but that is deliberate (n overtime out of stupidity) with a view to attracting new customers and keeping existing ""mugs""."
12Xpert,both conservative and labo you are manifestos were full of of the proverbial  it is  just that the whilst the former smelt like something  years old you are dog does the latter smelt like an entire farm yard of shit silage and urine.
12Xpert,i calculate a 9.26 percent  yield from 3467 bets avg odds 4.39. p-value is 0.05 relative to an expectation of -1 percent  (rough estimate based on  years old you are clv). bayes factor is 160. they're strong signs that clvh isn't correct here.
12Xpert,should have my article on the mathematics of losing runs published sometime this week. you can try the numbers and see if you agree with me. but really i'm just splitting hairs here. the points made by peter are well worthy of consideration.
12Xpert,i was never actually talking about tipsters in this thread and the odds were pinnacle closing.  it is  simply an exercise in illustrating how easy it is to be fooled by  years old you are own profits. nothing here had any skill whatsoever.
12Xpert,they will presumably e-mail you about it.  that is  how i found out. or perhaps if you are already restricted on their sportsbook you might n overtime get the offer. get in touch with their customer services and ask. this was the e-mail.
12Xpert,"ha 
which? sbc or ? either way no one should block you for just doing that. th against the spread suggestive of lying to  years old you are customers.
ive done a follow up to this thought experiment for next months pinny article."
12Xpert,which is precisely the problem with the eu.  it is  become a political project still pretending to be an economic one but n overtime telling the electorates the full truth about how  it is  going to have to go so ensure it survives.
12Xpert,however on matters of national and constitutional importance you have to ask the people. we did it over av and scottish independence.  every time there is a new eu treaty it should be put to the people of every eu nation. it isn't.
12Xpert,so i heard. so they should have restarted the game if thiem was there and djokovic losing by default. but thiem is probably too decent a fellow to agree to that and roland garros too spineless to take on the world number 1.
12Xpert,that is  assuming this new body carries any regulatory weight with the likes of  and  which it won't. and if it did the more likely outcome is that it would just kill off the affiliate industry because brands would simply do what  did.
12Xpert,is that what the  actually said in their ruling? the evidence will be there it would make an interesting research project into closing line value but perhaps what is in question whether they bothered to look for it or whether coral refused access.

RufusPeabody,i realize that darren but the implication of  years old you are tweet (intentionally or not) is that ohio by 9 was a good outcome for dra free throw kings when in fact in was almost certainly a bad outcome for them.
RufusPeabody,it is  looking at actual yards but adjusting for down/dist/fp (different baseline on opponent's 1 than at own 20 for example) as well as adjusting for game situation which consists of both situational weights and different baselines based on score diff/time remaining
RufusPeabody,"i have a *ton* of confidence in the  front office. maybe i'm biased (they are analytics-minded + i know  really like sig) but this is the first time in my life a team i support has a front office that ""gets it""."
RufusPeabody,serious question for the  guys and  say you release a pick at -110 and the line moves and the best available is -115. do you recommend  years old you are subscribers make the bet at -115? and does that vary by pick?
RufusPeabody,i would totally do a usaa referral program if they had one. they are fantastic! use them for car home rental and umbrella insurance too. only problem is the no physical branches thing which isnt great when youre in a cash business.
RufusPeabody,i went to sleep bud. i  daily fantasy sports  see much of an issue with the bj team. are you saying card counting isn't allowed or communicating secretly while a hand isn't going on isn't allowed or the combination of the two.
jeffma,dude. stop. getting the  field goal  there was what i would have preferred with over 48 and -3.5 you cant even get that right. the decision by zimmer was far from braindead and you cant just admit that. as  would say. sad!
jeffma,you have to be careful with that kind of data because it may n overtime really ca point ure real market sentiment and is really more of a narrative than a predictor. #badbe against the spread now that is good gambling content
jeffma,.   i listened to the  podcast about matthews beignet photo and didnt expect that it would be even worse than i expected since my expectations were so low. checked ig and was amazed at how terrible the photo was. nice work tmr!

SportsCheetah,yeah plenty of other people do incessantly was just referring to that. if  that is   years old you are guys take a free throw er everything  that is  fine. i'm pro-staying the hell out of it going forward. good luck this weekend.
capjack2000,i sent this to dustin gouker (via back channels) the very morning the dk/sbt merger was announced.  it is  been nearly two weeks still haven't heard from dustin yet he continues to tell anyone who will listen that he's owed an apology:
capjack2000,it is  easier to balance the action on a spread than a moneyline because far more action comes in on spreads. while a bookmaker might n overtime always want to balance the action having that ability allows them to handle more risk.
capjack2000,its been reported by all those sources. all citing the official nfl press release. shaw has admitted he wagered in vegas with friends thinking it was legal to do so. all parties and sources say there was no evidence of inside information.
capjack2000,"they just explained live betting as like playing blackjack while knowing the dealers hole card.  they meant you have more information than betting pregame.

dinkinc,it all depends on if i like the sequence. if a 3/5 looks unbeatable i have to find some strong anti favorites or i will pass. follow  as he talks sbout ticket construction and is more dedicated to racing than i am
robpizzola,im thinking a similar situation is going to happen with jets/flames being played in regina. jets still get l assit change but crowd will be very mixed probably slightly heavier towards to flames. n overtime marked as a neutral site game anywhere.
robpizzola,i hate seeing plays like that but i  daily fantasy sports  know what the db is supposed to do in that situation. he's n overtime even looking at allison there. eyes on the ball the entire way thinking he has an int.
robpizzola,russell wilson has no offensive line or defense this season. the rams have both + one of the best receiving groups in the league. russell wilson also doesn't need his head coach to read defenses for him at the line of scrimmage.
robpizzola,i  daily fantasy sports  have historical playoff series odds. this is definitely right up there but  that is  only because there isn't that big of a gap from the top playoff team to the worst playoff team relative to other major sports.
robpizzola,i'll go a step further and say that if i was brad treliving or doug wilson i would have called up the blue jackets a month before the deadline and sold the farm for bobrovsky. miller wouldn't waive his no-trade clause btw.
RASPicks,for what  it is  worth  i have a l overtime of respect for rufus and agree with almost all of his tweets.  all my disagreements have been on the same topic of n overtime noting exce point ions to rules regarding touts.

they are now down 7-28 and will probably complain about n overtime getting their run game going."
suuma810,you can only own the top while being efficient. you will always have the same amount of drives (+-1) as  years old you are opponent. therefore you simply need to make more out of  years old you are opportunities than the chiefs.
ClevTA,definitely dont like rooting against a kid but i g overtime so much backlash for taking a hard stance against his nba prospects. before the dra free throw  i used terrance ross has his nba comp. that would be fine by me
ClevTA,and vernon doesnt stink. u guys are making this assum point ion a free throw er 5 gms. he hasnt been great with the browns but he was awesome in ny for multiple years. lets see if he turns it on soon

spanky,great read  the unfortunate reality is the best analysts are rarely great socialites. academia should prioritize public speaking and other means to get these brains out of their shells.  for me visiting costa rica and knowing my bookmakers personally has paid dividends
spanky,fair response.... who knows maybe the videos of me getting thrown out of all those casinos were paid actors... either way the upper echelon of o you are industry know all about me and what ive done.. probably best to ask them...
spanky,"december revenue report says alot:
1.)  is #1 retail sports book in nj (earning a mill more than all other nj shops combined)
2.) ac retail sportsbooks are very fragile.  given the opportunity someone like me could solely alter their entire month."
spanky,good to hear  topic#1: why do you resort to the extreme measure of banning winning players at  years old you are wednesday meetings?  are you n overtime capable of implementing a proper risk management system where all customers are acce point ed?
DocBettor,for the record i wanted to put more on chiefs -110 live but my available balance was already 0 from the earlier plays. it was nice n overtime needing to sweat the back door. congr against the spread to all #chiefskingdom backers!
PlusEVAnalytics,"you yada yadad the best part! 5 percent  theoretical edge gets regressed to 2.5 percent . a free throw er 500 even money bets  years old you are roi is 4.7 percent .
someones underbetting that 501st bet and it aint me."
PlusEVAnalytics,let x be some variable that you dont know but others do. x may correlate with results and  years old you are chart above would still hold true. this is why market efficiency is easy to disprove but imo impossible to prove.

aluckyaday,what is so wrong with asking the people again once the terms are known. i just can't see a valid argument against that. surely it is the most democratic thing to do given that electoral law was broken during the first vote?
aluckyaday,which seems like a reasonable conclusion for the government to make. but if does n overtime solve the underlying problem. neither will targeting online casinos. in my opinion online casinos are a much bigger risk as it is done behind closed doors.
aluckyaday,yep. they are weak by choice as it allows them to maximize their profits managing liabilities by restricting accounts. in a perfect world there would only be one price as arbers would bring all the non restricting sharp books in to line!
aluckyaday,lets see. pinney have created a very successful business using arbers to extract the recreational money from those soulless books. i bet pinney can't wait for non limiting american books to really become available online! plenty of arbers rubbing their hands too!
aluckyaday,i would hope a university lecturer in statistics would understand randomness in betting! i might be confusing him with someone else but i think he just data mined until he found something that showed a profit. no validation and testing is live!
aluckyaday,will the favorite even run? didn't it run yesterday. was thinking rule 4 thieves are the reason perfect illusion is contracting. but i guess guaranteed prize money is an incentive to run does n overtime have to perform well to get paid!
aluckyaday,"""he added that bookmakers in his area didnt go over 150 percent  suggesting that bookmakers in the sp sample did less of a job offering value to bettors."" i do wonder sometimes how anonymous the books used for sp returns really are."
joeytunes2,heres some super sharp content from a 100 dollar shittalker.  i wanted to call you to see if you had a problem but a free throw er  years old you are burned me through the james guy. you must have changed it
joeyisaks,or bernie supporters underestimate how divisive and that he is n overtime liked inspires people to vote for anyone but bernie aka joe yesterday bc its a 2 man race now. bernie is seen as dangerous to most people with common sense
EdMillerPoker,exactly. my whole thesis is that there are other o point ions than to build a 365 clone and instead of trying to be the 10th 365 clone its probably better business especially in this country to try to differentiate another way.
EdMillerPoker,hey jackson just found  years old you are channel and im really enjoying it. my mom is a retired anglo-saxon and old norse scholar who (briefly) taught at texas tech. thanks for putting all the work into  years old you are videos.
EdMillerPoker,one reason you might want a second book is fairly simple.  years old you are main book has tons of variety but can't deliver a specific killer experience in-de point h because  it is  spread itself too thin trying to be everything.
EdMillerPoker,i'm fairly sure  it is  due to the regulatory issues  alluded to. for example we think we have built an nfl in-game product that would be perfect for several operators in nevada but as of today we cann overtime sell it here.
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  i remember seeing a brief news item a couple months back about whus and reading between the lines i thought it meant they were reviewing/changing their approach to this.. prob with a more scalable process in mind
nonrandomalpha,om field goal  they're n overtime firing nagy. smdh. you homers think bears are going to the super bowl in week 1 and now in week 11 gotta fire the hc. do you at le assit recognize the extreme and unwarranted irrationality?
nonrandomalpha,because it wasnt a good win and really very few positive takeaways. if stafford plays we probably get roasted. driskel arguably played better than tru. this team continues to deserve criticism. eeking out a win in ugly form is n overtime encouraging.
nonrandomalpha,49ers now down two stud offensive linemen and their all-important fullback for at le assit the next several weeks. major losses for a team on the rise. i cant imagine their run game is going to be nearly as strong. handicap accordingly...
nonrandomalpha,love this visual and  years old you are provided narrative - sometimes there can be a notable divergence between the data-driven quantitative view of the game and the typical fan's qualitative view/memory of the game. great work - keep it coming please!
LeeSharpeNFL,"i think a good backup is powerful and making 2 good teams in  years old you are divison a l overtime worse has a l overtime of value.

keep in mind bears have a winning record and are 3rd in the divison."
LeeSharpeNFL,he needs to scramble a l overtime more but i definitely do n overtime agree he could be a top 10-15 qb. he is quite inaccurate and that is stable over time so we should expect him to continue to be inaccurate.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i'm using the nflscrapr model so n overtime my model i just processed/visualized.

but basically the model looks at historical trends based on score quarter/time remaining down/distance and timeouts remaining to project the likelihood from any given point in the game forward."
whale_capper,i bet virtually zero baseball so im obvs out of my de point h but at the rec shops for us facing offshores it lasted more than a week and it created a l overtime of fat bankrolls and subsequent good will
AndyMSFW,"didn't really hit a good dog with the degenerate moneyline system as only murray st +150 g overtime there so far.  so i'll be raising the stakes slightly.  1.5x my stakes from yesterday.

JoeyKnish22,yeah im probably looking at this too narrow minded or just jaded from a history of rec offshore accounts that g overtime smoked taking advantage of live betting. or ppl i know with domestic accounts that also g overtime chopped using live.
TheKostos,i lean more towards him being n overtime that good and this being an outlier. he had a l overtime of years in miami and generally played his worst when it mattered the most. but he's been great in tennessee no doubt
LockyLockerson,i thought  had a l overtime of fun on l assit night's show and did a ton of  college football  discussion as well as some good interviews.  podc assit link below! thanks for supporting the show we've heard from many of you.
LockyLockerson,"attn: patreon members

sunday nba overnight projections + analysis now available over at my page.  a much calmer sunday with no rest/injury spots that are nearly as severe as just about every game tonight.

for those who aren't in yet come join!"
LockyLockerson,i believe i use 2.37 for the book calculations but id say its more important to just be consistent with what youre using than which of the two you choose.  you just need a framework to compare team a to team b.
EliHershkovich,". signaling possible bears' regression   it is  hard to argue.

chicago's passing attack with at le assit a 52 percent  success rate in three of its first five games but repeated the same rate in just three of its final 12 contests:"
EliHershkovich,"uh did you see the texas tech-virginia ending? how 'bout both final fo you are games?

 daily fantasy sports  get why this has to be an argument. they're two different entities  both competitive. if the nba wasn't high-level basketball i'd be concerned."
DannyParkins,best part of this lsu score is we somehow might get to bet clemson as an underdog in the title game. i saw clemson +1.5 today in a lookahead line. getting +3 or more would be such an awesome start to 2020.
DannyParkins,"we're doing  at tavern in the green in evergreen park on 95th st this a free throw ernoon.    will be there late in the show to do bears pregame starting at 6. wanna see the ""d overtime com dot"" mob in attendance."
DannyParkins,i love when adult dannys do work. trevathan and i bonded over being adult dannys at training camp. id prefer daniel jones go by danny jones before i sign off on his danny dimes nickname. thank you for attending my ted talk.
DannyParkins,as a bad golfer but one who had a full spinal fusion in addition to other back operations this is the tiger woods story ive been waiting to read. well done  like ive been saying tigers physical comeback is actually being underrated.
DannyParkins,gronk. zion. mo. who else is on the list of players on hated teams that you couldn't help rooting for? and what do those guys have in common that makes them so likable? the danny parkins show starts now on   sirius 206
DannyParkins,it is  true baseball has a game that counts tomorrow. you have to scroll down on  to see a story about it too.  i know  it is  for global growth and i'm sure  it is  being promoted in asia but still wild.
chadmillman,". on summer league: ""a never-ending stream of games with vaguely familiar names...as if you took an nba game and cloned it losing a bit of genetic makeup."" 

+ he live bet a game for a look into o you are future."
Gingfacekillah,nothing particularly original.  and others have written about it at length. i was curious if there was a way to better estimate true possessions with box score data without necessarily counting possessions play by play. this is a preliminary attem point .
Gingfacekillah,"it should go without saying that the hardest work youll do is creating/testing/verifying a model that can reliably calculate  years old you are edges accurately enough that kelly becomes viable.

once you have that its time to leverage the hard work intelligently."
Gingfacekillah,i'm n overtime going to give that information out.  it is  more valuable  to you if you can figure it out for yourself anyways. think about the problem brainstorm solutions and see if you can work out what i've done here. ;)
Gingfacekillah,additionaly jcu considered my electrical trade school marks in addition to my undergrad in social sciences as part of my entry application. i had top grades in electrical physics/math (journeyman electrician here) but many schools  daily fantasy sports  consider those grades official.
Gingfacekillah,like all sports it starts getting more interesting when you model it decently and begin making money. l overtime of randomness. injuries  individual player considerations very important. scoring distribution is a mash up of multiple distributions which makes things a bit wonky
Gingfacekillah,a basic example of how you might forec assit an nba total at the team level. expected possessions expected points per possession. there's more to it than this but i wanted to give a basic idea for those that have been asking.
Gingfacekillah,no problem. the best ideas are in the current editions of various statistical  moneyline journals. i g overtime a subscri point ion to science direct and a few others a while back. fresh research work delivered to  years old you are inbox
logan_matthews9,you must n overtime be very aware if you think people dont rip vegas dave and the like all the time. and jambos is no different than any other tout - making promises they cant keep - they just have better marketing
logan_matthews9,matt - as someone who avoids them from a time value perspective do you think theres still good value in season props? obviously + expected value is + expected value but n overtime having that bankroll for 8+ months is brutal imo
logan_matthews9,theyve g overtime around a -.75 gd/game which is bad but n overtime historically bad. dc has about -.35 gd/game so id give cincinnati around a 45 percent  chance to win whereas the odds say theyve g overtime a 38 percent  chance

adamchernoff,non exchanges have higher prices  daily fantasy sports  have third party so free throw ware  daily fantasy sports  allow you to put stakes into the queue and availability/reliability are more limited. extremely difficult to scalp high leverage points (for example) with sportsbooks.
adamchernoff,"with the 1pm and 4pm games complete there is plenty of opportunity to revaluate the games looking beyond the final score. 

my latest article for  lays out the step by step process i carry out each sunday evening for rebuilding box scores:"
adamchernoff,this way of thinking helps with looking forward and evaluating what the new market is accounting for. it also helps immensely with identifying movement which is based on those anchored to the closing pregame price. hope this is something to think about.
adamchernoff,"i cant hear you

12Xpert,brilliant. unsurprisingly  it is  top heavy because there is a lower goals limit (zero) but theoretically no upper goals limit. taking that into account it looks quite normally distribution with the exce point ion possibly of one or two outliers e.g. messi.
12Xpert,glad to see that a free throw er 18.5 years the rationale for raw excel/csv data still exists: let the user decide how they want to use it. that was always the point. excel must be an example of the lindy effect.
12Xpert,fundamental attribution error: the tendency to overestimate the action of others as being intentional rather than the product of random situational circumstances. in the case of man u touchdown   arsenal also conjoined with the confirmation bias of believing themselves to be entitled.
12Xpert,they do. and we know the chances of you beating the closing line by 3 percent  plus margin over this sample because of luck is zero. which does imply that you or at le assit the information that you hold moves lines.
12Xpert,obviously calculator is suited for simple bet scenarios with the sames odds and stakes but i've tested it against monte carlo and  it is  reasonably robust provided odds or stakes  daily fantasy sports  vary too much for example asian handicap/point spread betting.
12Xpert,that is  correct. seems to me that if you know what you're doing with bog they'll ban you anyway so taking 2 percent  on the exchange is surely a good o point ion. the alternatives are 5 percent  and 8 percent .
12Xpert,"maybe people find those who say ""prorogue"" boring bastards. flat earthism on the other hand much more interesting. fits nicely with those other conspiracy theories that people like jc routinely encourage their acolytes to indulge in. ""you're being controlled by the f/jew."""
12Xpert,in april the forec assits were for germany to manage it sometime within 2019. if germany's economy contracts july to se point ember then  it is  in one. specific enough for you or should i just be a wanker and block you?
12Xpert,when i targeted so free throw  books for outliers and saw that just two of the hundreds of odds i bet dri free throw ed by closing i knew that i had a winning system. the profit it made was completely irrelevant.
12Xpert,it is  already been explained by me and others. they are the most popular global so free throw  book and 99 percent  of punters need so free throw  books to have a chance of finding +ev. most of those won't get restricted.
12Xpert,doesn't follow. if a bookmaker exploits a square's bias in making a 1.95/1.95 market that wins 49 percent /51 percent  the bookmaker will make more than the vig of him but the fader will still show a loss of -0.55 percent .
12Xpert,will explain how exactly in the next article for  (hopefully published at the start of next month). i'm sure he'd be happy to run over it in brief again here and for a rough approximation use the regression equation in the chart.
12Xpert,it is  still 21 percent  with 1000 bettors (513/487 or worse leaves bookie exposed). so the conclusion has to be that the bookie with small margins will o free throw en be exposed on one side on a bet by bet basis.

RufusPeabody,"ny giants only had yards/play edge of 6.5 to 5.6 in their win over miami. but they improve almost a half-yard on both ends a free throw er contextualizing and end up with a ""real"" ypp margin of 7.0 to 5.1."
RufusPeabody,raw yards per play doesn't properly account for context.  expected points added  handles down/dist/field pos but adds noise by giving too much wgt (from a predictive standpoint which is all i'm interested in) to turnovers and high leverage (3rd/4th down) plays.

RufusPeabody,what explains the continued popularity of the fade the most inefficient play in football? my guess is qbs feel some pressure from their best wrs  i can beat this guy just  give me the ball  and throw them the occasional bone.
RufusPeabody,you'd have to ask him. i remember in 2008 he had binders full of player ratings (he could tell me about the third-string le free throw  tackle at new mexico state).  daily fantasy sports  know what his process is now. (cc
RufusPeabody,havent read it but the argument is never that exchanges are the answer to everything. they just make way too much sense for situations where two people would like to bet opposite sides but cant because books wont take their action.
RufusPeabody,first  podc assit in 3 week!.  and i have a free-flowing conversation touching on football modeling second half betting and the us betting industry where i argue there is plenty of balanced sharp action the market fails to ca point ure.
RufusPeabody,honestly th against the spread a good question and one i dont know the answer to. there is no grand plan at this point (exce point  the non-profit im hoping to launch soon). and obviously im n overtime going to tout.
RufusPeabody,i think th against the spread exactly what happened here. the argument that they thought it was all irish doesnt make sense since they only priced northern irish golfers. any time i have an edge i deem a number was mispriced

capjack2000,you get something more when the seminoles want something more and let the racinos get one step closer. seminoles want dice and roulette first though and they still have other table games as a bargaining chip to give to the racinos.
capjack2000,same here. my mlb code is my oldest code so its the hardest to decipher. plus mlb is the market that seems to get more efficient each year. there are some high profile guys that are definitely speeding the plow now.
capjack2000,i agree  but will the desire to watch all the games at once drive traffic to the sportsbook? will out-of-state people want to make a weekend of it like they do in vegas?  it is  an interesting case-study for other states.
capjack2000,their partnership pennwood also owns garden state parks racing license as well as atlantic city racetrack. greenwood was opposed to development to avoid taking away from pa parx. this signals they realize the worth of being in both markets via online.

robpizzola,because it was a fucking awful trade. a franchise that should have started to rebuild and they went all-in instead. really happy they gave up that first rounder so that amari could spend all the important snaps on the bench today.
RASPicks,why aren't there more proponents for a  style sportsbook in the usa?  let guys like  and  bet however much they want against whoever will take it at reduced vig and places like  and   daily fantasy sports  have to manage the risk?
RASPicks,contrarian to what?   it is  n overtime like all of the sharps and all of the public are always on the same sides?  to me  it is  n overtime far from the thinking that vegas has sucker lines and trap games.

suuma810,cool first episode truly enjoyed it. lbs are the rbs of the defense was a funny but also interesting nugget that had me thinking! cant wait for the next episodes and wish that you can get sashi on it one time.
suuma810,he will get the ball in his hands every time the rams finish a drive. if you reduce the number of his drives you reduce yours as well. you still need to outscore him whether its in the 40s or 50s.

ClevTA,baker somehow decided to scramble out of this pocket. no idea why. i feel like everyone just assumes an ol isnt playing well whenever a qb leaves the pocket. this was so unnecessary. hell get better i know this for sure
ClevTA,if pamphile is out tomorrow he will be replaced by douglas a guy who didnt play a snap l assit year and hasnt played a snap since 2015 in miami. he was rated 96th out of 106 guards in 2015. yikes

spanky,it aint gills fault hes just reading the ad.   needs to have some type of quality filtration on who to acce point  advertising dollars from.  you guys are making strides trying to help bettors.  dont sell out and insult listeners intelligence.
spanky,bullshit bro.  takes 50k nfl sunday.   i will always get that if i want it.   years old you are logic is equivalent to me going to mcdonalds asking for a big mac and them telling me a different price each time.
spanky,most gamblers are completely clueless and will allow themselves to be robbed.  i was walking through a casino in vegas and a triple 0 roulette table was packed.  the casinos and the government will take as much as you allow them...
spanky,ill take the dog for the limit... these guys are the real deal.  i g overtime a real good feeling about this joint...   and  are the only real bookmakers in new jersey... everyone else should be embarrassed to call themselves bookmakers
spanky,years old you are chances of winning the bet are the same.  years old you are chances of pushing the bet will increase from 0 percent  to approx 4 percent  which is the number of times the game will fall 6...
spanky,i'm late to the party on this as it happened months ago but i figured i'd retweet how  tried to jerk  .  i also recently started listening to  and  on  and i highly recommend it. keep up the good work fellas!
spanky,i have no clue.  i dont bet season futures. most of my betting is on credit and tying up my credit for an entire season is never the right play.  this time of year i need credit like i need blood.

PlusEVAnalytics,i feel awful for these guys. first the police / black lives matter fiasco now this. outrage culture is real and it sucks it must be exhausting to have to pander to everyone all the time. 2slgbtqqia+ is a hilarious example.
aluckyaday,there is n overtime the casino culture in europe especially in the uk working classes. as gambling has been freely available forever with betting shops on every street corner recreational gambling has been on horses and dogs and more recently football.
aluckyaday,but you then really get in to the realms of sample sizes. 50000/1 events do happen so do 1 million to one so do 50 million to one. someone wins the lottery each week. are they skillful at picking lottery numbers?
aluckyaday,"indianapolis colts at pittsburgh steelers back pittsburgh steelers -1
tampa bay buccaneers at seattle seahawks back seattle seahawks -4
green bay packers at los angeles chargers back los angeles chargers +4
new england patriots at baltimore ravens back baltimore ravens +3"
aluckyaday,in that particular period history shows the lower odds were less profitable. it goes back to the same argument is 600 bets enough to determine anything significant? is that information useful going forward? what happens when you reorder the full history
aluckyaday,"seattle seahawks at pittsburgh steelers back seattle seahawks +4 (+4)
dallas cowboys at washington redskins back washington redskins +6 (+5)
chicago bears at denver broncos back denver broncos +2 (+2.5)
cleveland browns at new york jets back cleveland browns -6.5 (-2.5)"
aluckyaday,yep. i ditched all those expenses. well n overtime the kids we did n overtime get that far. enough equity in the uk house to live mortgage free here. n overtime having to pay for accommodation is what makes it possible.
aluckyaday,seems like someone trying to boost their ego to me. i thought courtsiders were usually on the payroll of syndicates and are n overtime involved in placing the bets. he probably has no idea where or how the bets are placed!
aluckyaday,looks like i could have g overtime it wrong today. if n overtime  it is  going to be a stunner  there were 8 on the shortlist. out of the 4 i eliminated 3 have run already and all 3 have won!
aluckyaday,exactly you are basing  years old you are conclusions on the most visible ones which is n overtime a representative sample of the population. it is the exact things you dislike that makes them visible. a nice example of selection bias
aluckyaday,interesting. assit ana have quite an advantage in the 4th to 6th riders. no idea how you would come up with a weighting to reflect it or how much of a difference it actually makes though. seems like  thinks it does!
joeyisaks,maya moore is missing the wnba season so she can push for the release from prison of a missouri man who she believes is innocent... you cant make this stuff up the wnba is the best most unselfish league there is.
joeyisaks,of course they would its just stupid they do that message to try to make themselves look legit when they should just say hey sorry theres no rules im an illegal bookie and i dont want to pay so i wont
joeyisaks,in these mismatches like so miss bama the biggest athletic discr expected points added ncy is in special teams so the punter realy should just punt out of bounds every time .. especially if they are trying to cover 40 points
EdMillerPoker,"a weekend mingling with likeminded people schmoozing with some gambling celebrities and just enough pull back the curtain aha moments to keep the brain engaged.

EdMillerPoker,tho that is how some ppl will bet when they find a scalp. like if they find -140 one place and +142 the other they'll bet like that on both to lock in a third of a percent on their money
EdMillerPoker,the plan was to out a pretty big angle ( that is  kinda on its l assit legs) but someone spent a few days patiently talking us out of it and in the end we didn't. maybe in the next book.
EdMillerPoker,the most obv one is anyone who wants to actually bet volume. but also many casual-class customers. the leagues want fan engagement and imo several operators would be well-served to ask how can i build something that actually maximizes fan engagement

most bettors never have a defined process because they dont know what they want to get out of betting.

this qa episode speaks on my experience with both:

adamchernoff,n overtime sure with the one you mentioned. for in play tennis specifically using a traditional bookmaker with a personal account the decline rate is very high as is i imagine with an aggregator or brokerage it would be much worse.

12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  have that. the guys who run flashscore (livemedia) will collect this via but you would have to pay. they own a subsidiary called enetpulse who can provide this sort of thing but  it is  n overtime cheap.
12Xpert,in fact reading the letter it doesn't actually say anything about the ifs's position and says nothing about whether such public spending plans can be paid for only by the top 5 percent . it simple agrees with the spending plans.
12Xpert,"the problem with arguing for efficiency from smaller samples is whether  it is  simply variance  that is  tricking you into seeing an inefficiency.

i think in this case the inefficiency could be real but if it is  it is  very weak."
12Xpert,just do the science will you? you evidently know the things that have to be done to be a 7 percent  yield winner. so go find hundreds of the buggers doing those things and then  let us  study how they perform.
12Xpert,...how newspapers should behave provided the behavio you are under scrutiny is within existing law. yes politicians can change the law but when this involves press freedoms including those to offend they do so a great risk. that was my point.
12Xpert,why should anyone imagine it will really care about cleaning up the affiliate industry when  and  allow ads like this when the cap code states marketing communications must n overtime link gambling to seduction sexual success or enhanced attractiveness (rule 16.3.8).
12Xpert,the most obvious example of this is the favourite-longsh overtime bias. but screwing people who like longshots doesn't imply those who back favourites will make a profit at le assit n overtime these days and certainly n overtime at efficient bookmakers.
12Xpert,perhaps i'm missing something here i'm n overtime an addition expert but when i saw the #betregret tv ads this is how they came across to me and i was le free throw  thinking 'is that how you would tackle anorexia?'
12Xpert,so here i'm pretending  was a bookmaker offering their implied odds. so e.g. if 538 odds / pinny odds = 1.1 hpothesis predicts actual roi for a sample of such bets will be 1.1. the chart looks pretty convincing to me.

mschwimer,in addition the 59.36 percent  claim was simply a fact.  that is what we did.  period.  we never said we could continue that pace.  in fact we made it very clear that it was extremely unlikely to continue at that pace.
mschwimer,you will see it very clearly. i promise you. just needs to be part of a conversation to get the point across most effectively. i have nothing to hide from. twitter just n overtime the avenue. th against the spread all.
mschwimer,im heading to bed. big day tomorrow. as always happy to have  or  on the jambos podcast.  i personally think the gambling world deserves to hear two professionals discuss in de point h gambling content in a professional and civil manner.
mschwimer,my recommendation would be to register for free and see for yourself.  we have free picks thursday so if you register you can get those picks and check to see if those lines are generally available at the book you use.
mschwimer,i am most certainly n overtime a sharp.  i  daily fantasy sports  create the models.  o you are team does.  it is why i named the company a free throw er them and why each of them is an equity partner.
mschwimer,"very sorry i missed these. 

1. no. we hired a funny guy. in profile it was twitter is silly
2. god no. im n overtime close to smart enough to do what my team does. we have 25 people full time."
mschwimer,my favorite thing about o you are system is its troll proof. the fact that you wont buy the package proves beyond a doubt that you think we will be profitable including juice over the entire nfl season. so thank you!
mschwimer,thank you! time will tell on it being free. if we do end up charging it will be different than all other subscri point ion services as we will be putting o you are money where o you are mouth is.
RufusPeabody,it is  become more and more apparent that something is necessary. i've had conversations with    and others about this. i want to know from any of you all who are interested -- what do you think the priorities should be?
RufusPeabody,because there's no evidence that shows otherwise. very easy to refute me if i'm wrong. have cohnreznick issue a report saying exactly what they did. and actually have it signed by a partner. show the daily emails with the picks.
RufusPeabody,but the default view is he was an undra free throw ed free agent he doesnt have the upside. guy was a 5-star recruit #1 qb recruit in the country coming out of hs. never fulfilled his potential in college.
RufusPeabody,if the angle exists all the bets i placed based on it are great bets. if it doesn't they're bad bets. so the existence (or lack thereof) of this angle should cause my results on these bets to be correlated.
RufusPeabody,ok im going to share the craziest idea ive had. it started out as just a vegetable dra free throw  but i think you could make it an food dra free throw /league. bear with me heres the premise (thread):
RufusPeabody,i was ske point ical of rob at first too. the whole prediction machine predictatitilator thing. but when he told me it was crap that was a big step for us. n overtime a hotel room step but big nonetheless
RufusPeabody,numbers get bet into place (well to market number) quickly a free throw er releases. but there are quite a few youd do well to wait until game time on. super bowl is a different animal than any other game.
capjack2000,"i'm hoping we're all concerned over nothing. i'm hoping tn reads all the comments that have been submitted. i'm hoping lawmakers recognize how different states have been successful in their approach. i'm hoping that...

or is that following a week 17 where they rest all starters? 

and 53 losses ago...that may include doug flutie."
capjack2000,"it seems extreme...but i agree. 

this is a violation of njsa 5:12-100(e) which states that only the njccc (now njdge) has the right to exclude a player based on their skill in beating a game played according to the rules."
capjack2000,they dont list salary range but im going to guess it doesnt pay enough. nothing against statsbomb but these sportsbetting related companies cant hold the best talent because they cant compete against the sports teams or the big betting syndicates.
capjack2000,do you come up with  years old you are madden ratings ahead of the release or do you adjust the madden ratings up or down based on  years old you are research? just curious on  years old you are process.
capjack2000,we're in the zone where nobody signs up though. everyone either signs up early or during the final week. i'd wager the circa contest will have an overlay going into the l assit week and finish well over 1500 entrants.
capjack2000,n overtime illegal to bet in a nj casino if you have a felony record. in fact i'd hold that it is the casinos who have banned him who are breaking rules. only the njdge has the right to exclusion.
capjack2000,the whole argument should be moot. every bar in nj hell every starbucks in nj is a sports betting parlor. nj needs to advertise to neighboring states how easy it is to register deposit and bet sports on mobile apps.

ProfessorShine,it is ridiculously easy for  to mention the promotion but also mention the negatives to it.  if n overtime it is just free marketing.   i cant even say darren is only one doing it hes just most visible right now.
ProfessorShine,darren also never addressed the potential of their content which flies in the face of helping any bettor to be better.   then the other tan reps promote their wins  ignore their losses for subscribers.  isnt this why pregame takes heat?
suuma810,we took no +3.5 and smoked the opening line. great buy low sp overtime on the saints a free throw er their slow start. falcons cluster injuries on defense no way to defend kamara  thomas. close game in the end.

CizzlingSports,.hi ryan. fyi here are   college football  records since he started selling picks 2 seasons ago. prob n overtime a good idea to get excited about a 19 pick sample size (he's sold 19 picks so far n overtime 20).
CizzlingSports,".anyone want to guess whether that 2018 link includes his 6-17 bowl games record .

spoiler: it doesn't. so no every pick is n overtime ""linked in the article.""

also 102-93 for 2018 is fantasy. but u knew that already."

PlusEVAnalytics,yeah maaaayyyybe they changed the wording from first coach fired to first coach to leave to be politically correct? or and im just throwing this out there its to avoid an awkward grading situation if a coach quits (or dies)????
PlusEVAnalytics,the gas stations dont care. they get a commission on both tix sold and winners redeemed. if you pay for todays tix with yesterdays winners they can double dip. aps are probably keeping half the convenience stores in ontario open.
PlusEVAnalytics,as  and others correctly point out people can be currently infected currently alive and will die from the infection in the future. this will also cause a bias in reported mortality rate in the opposite direction to the above. (4/4).

aluckyaday,i would have though it would be a very small percentage as you have to explicitly select sp in the betslip rather than just take the default. that said i've clicked the sp box instead of ew a few times
aluckyaday,"buffalo bills at cleveland browns back cleveland browns -3
kansas city chiefs at tennessee titans back tennessee titans +6
los angeles rams at pittsburgh steelers back pittsburgh steelers +4
seattle seahawks at san francisco 49ers back san francisco 49ers -6"
aluckyaday,a quick question for  if i am n overtime running a long term bank and just want to know how to proportion bets on several selections with different edges / prices in the same tournament is the standard formula sufficient?
aluckyaday,to be honest it was n overtime really a conscious decision to change things so radically. had the opportunity to take a break from the rat race and 15 years later that has morphed in to a complete lifestyle change.
aluckyaday,think the l assit one was a little confused by the line movement  i plan to back these in 3 trebles and an acca each week lets see how the computer gets on. actually g overtime 6.5 on the redskins.
aluckyaday,the set out to change how bookmaking operates. they had the same thinking as you. why would anyone bet with a book when better prices can be had on an exchange? they were wrong. traditional books thrived they did not.
aluckyaday,new to this machine learning lark. i was wondering if i should just use a random sample but one line of code to split by year swung it. i'm from the bill gates school lazy programmers are the best ones!
aluckyaday,"i found this quote interesting ""public bettors are responsible for 90 percent  or more of the money wagered on a typical regular-season game"" many times i've heard ""sharps"" say the super bowl is the only game where recreational money dominates."
aluckyaday,basically tax/regulation too high in the uk for pinny and the like so i doubt they will be in the us in the near future. an o free throw en quoted answer is exchanges but again they struggle with regulation/tax.
aluckyaday,unfortunately (well actually intentionally from boris) the debate was probably too late to make any difference. hopefully mps do the right thing and stop him from forming a government. will they have the balls to do it? i doubt it.
aluckyaday,1.7 and 3.8 to lay on betfair so i'd go for loss leader. arb probably too risky for those that way inclined though given what has happened. would n overtime want my money tied up for a year in it!
aluckyaday,could this n overtime just be a function of the maths and rounding errors? anything over 2.0 now seems to be quoted to 2 decimal places whilst anything below it is quoted to 3. has it always been that way?
joeytunes2,been trying to reach you please have someone in upper management reach out to me. will give you number in dm. i would like to make this situation private but  years old you are n overtime leaving me much choice
EdMillerPoker,if you absolutely must buy and read this book that may or may n overtime be better than anything i've ever written about poker (again gonna ask you to talk to bill about that one) you can get it here.
EdMillerPoker,yeah all true. there are deeper cultural differences between us and europe as well that are going to trip up almost all the players (since as you've noted they're having trouble launching with even the most superficial cultural stuff right)
EdMillerPoker,for what  it is  worth  dink this is a quirk of a specific backend so free throw ware package used by a number of nv books. you'll see other quirks in how those same books book pregame over the app.
EdMillerPoker,we put o you are kid in soccer when he was 4 and one game as my sons team was losing 20+ to 0 i realized a group of parents had created a ringer team of fucking 4 year olds.
EdMillerPoker,imo this is n overtime a useful way to try to find value. the market changes too much over time. the bad assum point ion is that a game lined -3 in 200x would also be lined -3 today etc.
EdMillerPoker,"why did you retweet that scumbag?

maybe hes a scumbag but he has good ideas and th against the spread what matters.

jfc of course you like what hes saying. th against the spread the core skill set of conmen."
EdMillerPoker,"yes ""mugs"" will play peanuts into whatever hold you offer if  it is  what's around. but the more you jack up the hold the less compelling the product becomes to anyone who's marginal about gambling (which is obv most ppl)."
LeeSharpeNFL,i think this is mostly true for people who are in a financial situation where being out of a job is a very concerning event. nfl coordinators and head coaches are usually n overtime in this kind of financial situation.
LeeSharpeNFL,"x-axis =  expected points added  changes due to penalties called on opposing offenses (while team in question is on defense)

y-axis =  expected points added  changes due to penalties called on opposing defenses (while team in question is on offense)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"to be fair trubisky does have high variance between ""weird another crappy trubisky game who could have seen this coming?"" and ""fuck he looks average enough that i'm now terrified ryan pace is going to declare victory and extend him."""
LeeSharpeNFL,i am n overtime an xs and os guy but lining up in shotgun formation on 4th and 1 seems really dumb to me. i would think there would be large equity in making the defense respect the qb sneak.
LeeSharpeNFL,"stylistically blough actually does remind me of aaron rodgers.

- good at extending plays
- free play awareness
- is very risk averse
- likes to make big plays/go downfield

but he's certainly less accurate and n overtime as good."
LeeSharpeNFL,"i assume he's attem point ing to create the sense that this is what ""should"" happen so when it doesn't he can blame the nfl for forcing this to be on a saturday when hcs are likely to be busy."
whale_capper,youre probably right and the heavy number might be more of an indication that there is a surcharge on dallas games to put the books on a better number (like offering dal -3.5 when the power numbers would say -2.5)

TheKostos,the fans at anfield just exploded with that liverpool equalizer and i can't help but think  it is  one of the l assit times we're gonna get to see a crowd go nuts at a sporting event for a while
TheKostos,it certainly has disaster potential. but as a fan i'm more willing to roll the dice with the unknown than sign up for someone i know sucks (like they did with shurm you are or would have done with garrett)
LockyLockerson,inclined to agree just another set-up  that is  going to be a l overtime of people really mad.  to be fair in that sp overtime i'd much rather watch lsu in a cfp semifinal than the other o point ions.
LockyLockerson,"saturday nba projections and game analysis now up at the patreon page.

LockyLockerson,on the majority of games l assit season this model was within 0.5-1.5 points of the close on about 95 percent  of games. when it wasn't it was for a couple reasons: steam (for multiple different reasons) or an injury.
LockyLockerson,"thank you for all the pre-orders keep 'em comin! tell  years old you are friends!

DannyParkins,theres video of a dude getting ba point ized in au jus on my instagram story if th against the spread the sort of content youre interested in. this town has no idea what to do with itself until kickoff.
DannyParkins,lol i mean its n overtime an official psa that will run to serve the public good or anything just a fun disclaimer for the show but it was 100 percent  real in that it was him reading it etc
DannyParkins,the bulls are 19-33. the 6 seed is 31-20. sure injuries have hurt the bulls but realistically if they were perfectly healthy (which of course never happens) the best case scenario for this team is the 7th seed. basketball purgatory.

Gingfacekillah,basketball specific models complete just a few more cha point ers to go. 25000 words so far. including this nba all-star 3 point  competition monte carlo simulation i whipped up to pick joe harris as the best value this year.
Gingfacekillah,daily fantasy sports  data frequently uses moving averages which results in skews. so if you're basing  years old you are forec assits exclusively on  daily fantasy sports  data you'd likely see something like this and decide there wasn't much value.
Gingfacekillah,~1.5  points  on  million that looks decent. the rest are pretty close half points mostly. also mia likely be against the spread this spread - embiid being out should be worth more than 1 point to the spread i think.
Gingfacekillah,theyre must reads for beginning approach the leading edge of sports forecasting imo. pinnacle and the like are using  moneyline to make lines and adjust prices. i think turing was right only a sophisticated machine can beat another sophisticated machine.
Gingfacekillah,"good start.

(5-2)/(sq(5+2))= zscore: 1.133. probability record could occ you are by chance: =1(-normsdist(1.33)) = 9.17 percent  or 1 in 10 times. unwise to get too excited until you're p assit a z score of 2.00+ over hundreds of bets."
logan_matthews9,for reference 10th-20th pays the same so the only advantage of going 2-0 is the possibility of cracking the top 10 hence the point about having to pick contrarian. if picks are even i cant reasonably crack the top 10
logan_matthews9,i think putting a time line on it is silly. jozy is 29 and in his best form since probably early 2013. sargent played 7 minutes since february. let him start producing before hes burdened with carrying the nt too.
logan_matthews9,the comment was that his hold up play and off ball movement are special and only a 17 year old is close... even though jozy is the greatest hold up striker the us has ever produced by a wide margin
logan_matthews9,to  years old you are point (and the articles) it would be really dumb to base decisions off 4 games and n overtime a 34 game season. but theres no denying having a good wc will artificially increase someones value
PikachuBets,tell us what  years old you are z-score is for  years old you are sample size (any one of them) and ill concede the point that you actually know and understand what variance is for  years old you are bets
PikachuBets,how is it suspect? stop saying shit just to say shit. explain which part of what i said is suspect ty. its n overtime suspect that berry cucked me and blocked me before paying up and is now silent? please.
PikachuBets,the regular staking is okay. laying edge percent  as units. n overtime realistic for scaling but understandable. the arbitrary 5x multiplier is useless. why n overtime 10x? why n overtime 100x? obscuring mumbo jumbo and everyones gonna gobble it up.
PikachuBets,lmk  years old you are thoughts publicly. also to clarify who will be paying up for the losses on  years old you are end? will it be you or tommy or betus? important to know from whose coffers it'd come.
adamchernoff,it is a crowded show but a well coordinated one with  who has the skill of seeing the big picture on all things sports/betting but also able to deliver it in a thoughtful way that we all can work with.
adamchernoff,more x's and o's focused than betting but  is able to talk about football in a way that everyone can understand. every episode i learn a ton and high recommend it for those wanting to understand more about the game.
adamchernoff,caveat to this would be carolina and chicago which closed very near to where they opened. so 1-9 if you toss those out. but another week of moves getting smoked. fo you are moves of 3.5 or more each lost.
adamchernoff,interesting. i  daily fantasy sports  typically have them on that long. these took about 4 1/2 from start to finish. will have to give that a go. i imagine they turn out super tender with the two hours of wrapping?
adamchernoff,"football is back on  

big video  coming this morning led by   and a special new signing to the team. 

big question now is does a guy go daily standard jets tee or keep it professional with the slim fit polo?"
adamchernoff,tough job for anyone. it will depend on how quickly he has the nerve to take a stand against the fans. falcao is n overtime getting them into 2022 by himself. his success as manager will come down to timing.
adamchernoff,partner with someone like pollard banknote and integrate all the tickets into their packaging. segregate the market based on demographic and then pool sales and liquidity for the first worldwide scratch progressive. bonus it back into rewards for shopping/more play.
adamchernoff,"favourite follow (6/8):

Ccon8181,retract this marc. these guys didnt operate a entity wagering company. wernt registered nor approved  by the nevada gaming commission. they did very little sports betting . they ran a ponzi scheme. had 0 agreements with local banks or operators.
ToddFuhrman,hank you guys are going to be an interesting test case.  i think a l overtime of states will be watching to see how a mobile only business model works and what qualifications or operational guarantees are expected from operators
ToddFuhrman,my take is let all these kids turn pro...boom problem solved. im n overtime pro ncaa im just a bigger fan of amateurism for what it is and all participants know what they signed up for acce point ing scholarships

ToddFuhrman,people are slow to understand that...they see a longsh overtime and assume value even if there's no chance a ticket cashes.  it continues to boggle my mind but everyone wants to to be holding that sports lottery ticket these days
ToddFuhrman,daily fantasy sports  really know what to expect think it could be fun but tried to rank the weekends here more about betting opportunities and  daily fantasy sports  see the same o point ions coming from the dra free throw
ToddFuhrman,yep very hard and while its a lopsided league for hoops the core values of the university church wise align with the entire league. id love  college basketball  to ado point  a regionalized relegation system but it would never happen
ToddFuhrman,they have an athletic advantage in the paint against most teams they play...however that won't work the deeper they go into march when elite teams have big boys to bang down low and duke can't sho overtime from the perimeter
TheCousinSal,you have to respect giannis who waits until a free throw er receiving the mvp award to tear up unlike harden who does so on every play where a defender is within 7 feet of his shooting hand.  #greekfreak #classact
TheCousinSal,on this weeks against all odds i tell you why its okay to cry about a gsw bad beat - but n overtime tiger. also best nba/nhl bets with the degen 3   reveals tricks on how to wager on baseball.
TheCousinSal,congratulations to all of you who profited off my best bet in the playoffs ...p against the spread (-13.5)...and my eagles (+3) pick...and the tweet about the gronk to score prop. you really ou touchdown id yourselves. take a lap!
12Xpert,i would assume so although i dont have sufficient data to test it. ive been collecting their total goals odds this season. will probably need a couple of seasons to reliably analyse it. perhaps others have already done it.  ?
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  forget however that you prove that you're beating the closing line with skill but that doesn't necessarily imply you'll have expected profit. for that you need to beat the closing line by more than the bookmaker's margin.
12Xpert,1.0107 will almost certainly n overtime happen by chance (see ) so clearly you're bringing information to the market but  it is  n overtime enough to overcome the margin. of course clvh could all be wrong.  that is  another story.
12Xpert,i've put together my main leagues data since 2016/17 so basically since the book was published. just a straight comparison betting colder teams versus betting hotter teams. odds are pinny closing with margin removed (log function). t-test p-value = 0.015.
12Xpert,here you go then. a 49 percent  bettor is basically a pinny coin tosser at odds of 2.00. a 52 percent  bettor has an positive expected value of +4 percent . drawn like this doesn't look like a big difference.
12Xpert,ok but still a smaller sample compared to the one i used. i have seen the same as you from my data so i was surprised to see the log method closest of all of them to 0 percent .
12Xpert,until the eu assumes the legal and moral authority of a nation then any decisions it makes that are of nationally constitutional importance should be put to a vote in member nations. the eu is n overtime (yet) a nation.
12Xpert,daily fantasy sports  follow. i'm merely saying that when people start complaining that the future of o you are country is going to be decided by a bunch of oldish white men with wealth it smacks of ageism and misandry.
12Xpert,there are lots of things that chip away at family budgets. going to the cinema sky tv going to football games flying in planes. smoking drinking. some are socially harmful in excess. some environmentally damaging. what's morally special about gambling?
12Xpert,so running a monte carlo (1000 iterations) gives emdd of 62.4 (close to the calculated figure of 65.35 that kostas quoted presumably from  's brilliant calculator). in those 1000 iterations 6 had mdd above the actual quoted figure of 107.71.

mschwimer,how would you recommend marketing? i cant think of a single way to market ourselves and n overtime sound awful. i really dont disagree with you. it does sound awful. if you have any ideas please let me know. seriously.
mschwimer,extremely familiar. and i think ed is great. everyone i know that knows ed says he is a stand up guy. i just hate the way the tout industry works. period. no financial accountability of transparency. its a true shame.
mschwimer,we have backed up literally everything we have said.  i can 100 percent  guarantee we will escrow that money.  o you are terms are simple and fair and can be found on o you are website.  you can review anytime.
mschwimer,we have a stop built in when we hit a certain number of subscribers. we would never acce point  any subscribers if we couldnt fit the bill if we lose. would never acce point  10k people without raising additional money.
mschwimer,just spoke with fanduel sportsbook rep. according to them both bets would still be pending. nothing official. so the over will win and the  moneyline will be pending. they did say this is determined on a book by book basis.
RufusPeabody,i said th against the spread what i have his predicted worth at now n overtime how well hes played to this point. how well i anticipate him playing moving forward and how much th against the spread worth.
RufusPeabody,and back to the teaser across zero if they want more exposure on the vikings parlaying the vikings and chargers would have been much higher positive expected value than the 6.5-point -130 teaser. but  that is  just math. (6/6)
RufusPeabody,theyre probably listed as employees of big league advance. i have met many of the data science guys working for schwimer and think theyre smart guys. whether or n overtime you think theyll win jambos does have a team.
RufusPeabody,im n overtime going to waste my time boosting the profile of a fraud tout. we dont have mutual friends. and betting 100k with an internet stranger who you know to be a con artist would be incredibly dumb.
RufusPeabody,i priced max homa at 1064/1 to win the wells fargo this week. should he win he still won't be close to the most unlikely winner at quail hollow. i made derek ernst 1934/1 when he won in 2013.
jeffma,so listen to this podc assit if you want to find me   right now. o you are location is disclosed and we will buy you and old fashion if you tell us promo code rufus is a dogs name
jeffma,i just did the math on this for shits and giggles and if you assume he makes that 3 - 50 percent  of the time the expected win prob if he takes that sh overtime is about 93.5 percent
SportsCheetah,again go ahead and prove i'm 31 percent  on the show and you have yourself a free 100k. take screenshots of this so when you have  years old you are proof you can bl assit the internet with it.
capjack2000,"good episode. you both sounded like you weren't phoning it in (exce point  towards the end...someone lost their fervor).

good job with the army fight song. name that tune with college fight songs would be a good recurring segment."
capjack2000,"hawaii is quite literally an island of the absurd.

prosecuting someone for making $5800 in wagers over the course of a year. wiretapping surveillance prosecutors and the judicial system all in a giant waste of money...over a $100 bettor."
capjack2000,handle includes bonus money wagered. hold also includes bonus money so it is artificially lowered by the promotional wagers/wins. since the hold percent  has been pretty close to industry standard surprisingly the promotional spend has n overtime lowered revenues.
capjack2000,that reputation definitely harms their standing with both sharp and casual sports bettors. at the same time when will they reach a critical liquidity where they no longer need to be vigilant against sharp action? will they realize this?
capjack2000,"if i'm a sports athlete worth many millions and i have a rare day off in the middle of the season i'm n overtime spending it in atlantic city...

...and sure as hell n overtime at the golden nugget!?!?!"
dinkinc,taking them down is an admission of guilt... leaving them up makes it subjective... maybe he always looks like that...maybe it wasn't that bad looking... i saw them before he raced and being a non-horseperson i couldn't tell anything...
dinkinc,very excited and a bit nervous for my friend joanne calderwood today... it is  a number one contenders fight even though it is somehow the opening bout... for those who care i also think she is a solid bet
robpizzola,the most amazing thing about #gamblingtwitter is that some of these guys have been around for 5+ years throwing darts and have absorbed exactly 0 percent  of the good content  that is  been out there all of this time.
robpizzola,literally did n overtime even bet fo you are fi free throw hs of those games. lots of selections in latter half of seasons purely based on game theory. also had other entries in a couple of those years.
robpizzola,even with no monetary interest i always find myself rooting for the 5s against the 12s just because of all the stooges who force themselves to take a 12 to advance in their brackets each year because of trends.
RASPicks,as for why sell picks anyone paying attention can see we have been selling less and less of them for a long time now. when you win and have professional followers it is a very tough business to scale.
RASPicks,why still sell at all?  it has been a considerable asset and it has potential to create opportunities for us that we may n overtime get otherwise.  also some form of selling could someday become more scalable than betting.
VegasRefund,when evaluating motivation for week 17.. dont overlook that a l overtime of these teams have had nothing to play for for several weeks now.. and their approach wasnt effected then so its tough to say it will now.
suuma810,espn has them in the top-10 in pass rush win rate  top-10 in pressure rate without blitzing. eye test says they have been creating more coverage pressures - qbs need to hold the ball more vs much improved coverage.
suuma810,"die texans haben mit ihrem vorletzten drive die fhrung geholt und auf dem finalen drive war watson mit pssen und einem scramble fr 45 der 44 yards zustndig. die rbs haben einen ganzen minusyard geschaf free throw  ;)

suuma810,"on the first three drives that put the #patriots in scoring position (incl. the missed  field goal ) 93.4 percent  of their yardage came through the air.

they ran to milk the clock but they didn't run to win."
suuma810,i understand the situational play-calling for the #jaguars hasnt been o point imal. but this organization sticked to bortles and wants their run game the foundation of their offense. i wonder how free nathaniel hackett really was on sundays.

ClevTA,sure but winovich and bush were studs who overachieved and dra free throw ed pretty high too. the talent levels aren't exactly the same but the gap isn't allowing 50+ every year on d either. there's just something else
ClevTA,every time i turn on the espn betting show that anita picks the square dog. are her nfl picks being tracked? would love to know her against the spread  record with nfl dogs. i see she picked dallas+5.5  today

aluckyaday,this is the crux of racings problem. if it becomes less attractive to bookmakers it will die. bookmakers will survive without racing i doubt that applies the other way round. n overtime in the form it is now anyway.
aluckyaday,in theory their should be space for both models. some books catering for the more sophisticated bettor and some for the recreational bettor. but if one model is more profitable than the other market forces means it will dominate.
aluckyaday,sometimes. but i think most recreationals  daily fantasy sports  actually realise that by cashing out they are in reality just placing another bet which on a rare occasion may but most likely will n overtime be + expected value
aluckyaday,i will also always think the referendum process was flawed and if i still lived in the uk i would be worried about the precedent that sets. get the win at all costs and worry about the consequences later.

Gingfacekillah,this game didn't play out quite as expected. would have lost 1q 1h and  free throw  point spreads won 1q and 1h totals (under) and lost the  free throw  total. 2-4 which will be added to the test results.
Gingfacekillah,up  running with r just working through some simple online examples to get a feel for the process. going better than expected. thankfully much of my st against the spread skills from excel seem to be transferrable. #rstudio #statistics

12Xpert,ir is very popular now because punters like it and bookmakers make more money from it (bigger margins). hence  it is  probably harder to beat on average but if you do the work you may find more exploitable opportunities.
12Xpert,"using sportsbookreviewsonline's historical nba data archive i have a sample of 15508 matches. 15311 of those had a handicap favourite at closing line (-0.5).

12Xpert,i disagree. i would say anything systematic will be withing the bounds of their margin. anything outside it will be their errors or one-off decisions. things that are systematic are much easier to sp overtime meaning they should disappear.

capjack2000,"most people will blame bible-belt kickbacks from ms casinos or incompetence. however the fact is: mississippi's numbers haven't been good enough to entice louisiana to join in. 

lack of mobile in ms is hurting more than just ms."
capjack2000,peta also had a pythagorean theorem for nfl that he was working on a couple years ago. i ran some tests on it and it was decent. i think he abandoned it for pga. ugh those golf bettors.
capjack2000,the paradox is ocean and hard rock in ac. oceans sportsbook was packed all day but the casino was em point y. meanwhile hard rock had barely a handful of people in the book and a packed casino.
dinkinc,joe kelly had these sick unhittable stretches when he finds his groove...  sadly one wonders if he can find it again... the dodgers have some rope to give him since regular season wins are n overtime a priority
RASPicks,"client feedback from today's ras nflx release:  ""fyi that was as good as it gets my offscreen didn't move for 20+ secs a free throw er the release.""  learn more about o you are new release model here:"
RASPicks,g overtime slightly different numbers close enough but even though house edge on each individual side is slightly lower in the soccer game the fact that there are 3 o point ions makes the total house edge greater.
ProfessorShine,on a  podcast i mentioned the levels of bettors. yeah there are super-rec clueless action junkies. but there are also  smarter rec bettors who dont want to be scammed. a good analogy is showing someone basic bj strategy.
suuma810,saw value on sf and really liked their matchup. expected no to struggle offensively without peat and armstead (played). game played out differently than i thought. but beat the number and g overtime a bit lucky in hindsight.
suuma810,they are the no. 1 defense in dvoa since week 7 while playing guys like wilson brady  watson. i would call their defense effective. they have an elite secondary that allows them to employ this blitz heavy scheme.
suuma810,i wont celebrate o you are browns -3 winner because it was a bad play. i wont celebrate o you are browns -3 winner because it was a bad play. i wont celebrate... baker fucking mayfield you god!!!!
ClevTA,dont u dare act like the numbers arent skewed. take out one lamb long catch and its 100 total yards of offense on 32 plays for okl (3.1 ypp). 3 sacks on hurts. th against the spread awful
ClevTA,in the middle i agree but there are extremes on each side that i think are worth adjusting for. nobody can ever tell me buffalo's raw numbers for ex should be considered without some consideration for their opponents
ClevTA,but strength of record etc in  years old you are case would all go for georgia plus georgia would be sec champs. and theyd be doing all of this while ranked one sp overtime ahead of bama already.
ClevTA,right but bookmakers dont care about average joes anyway. i just laugh when i hear ppl say stuff like begging ppl to do something. no its the correct line its just general perce point ion that is wrong
ClevTA,so we get von miller tonight against cam erving in a loud stadium? hes allowed 11 pressures the l assit two games alone  has the 3rd worst pass blocking grade among all tackles in the l assit 2
ClevTA,i see rovell picked the titans to cover against the browns. as ive been saying even the squarest in the world are fading the browns bc its the cool thing to do. nevermind actual game matchups to consider
ClevTA,for the first time in a long time i didnt take any heisman sleepers this year.  but if u forced me to pick one out of the blue guy i think i would have gone with tommy stevens

jambos lost $50 for each of those packages.

CizzlingSports,"it appears they deleted all units allegedly won on picks that were never publicized and/or were graded against non-cris lines.

but certain units allegedly won on cris-graded plays before they started selling on 8/27/19 remain in the records"

CizzlingSports,they are 3 s expected points added rate tickets. point is he went to westgate on 8/15/18 and bombed in a bunch of $10  college basketball  futures so he can thump his chest if one happens to win
CizzlingSports,all the 8/28/19 tweets that the form d filing provides security to subs for the guarantee were misleading and incorrect as a matter of law but sure all current statements about jambos funding are accurate g overtime it
spanky,"i agree with you. 

i may disagree with his treatment of sharps but that doesnt mean i cant acknowledge that will hill is taking over the country. i wish it werent the case. can the machine be stopped?"
spanky,winning a game +3 when i could have taken +4 is n overtime exciting to me.   if i bet bad prices consistently i would go broke.  price is everything.  in this instance i was more lucky than good.
DocBettor,oh i  daily fantasy sports  think they view it as a bad line. it hasn't moved. l assit week i used a free play there on michigan +9.5 when they were +7.5 everywhere else. i guess we'll see!
DocBettor,"blackjack and sports betting are so profitable i'm up a whole $279 over the l assit 75 days

PlusEVAnalytics,"there are legitimately thirty people at this  who have ordered and are all waiting for their food. probably one person called in sick. this is what happens when we over-o point imize systems!!

cc  because taleb blocked me"
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah i know th against the spread what everyone says but i think that explains why coaches are too conservative n overtime why they dont adjust properly to win prob. perhaps large favs should kick more field goals.
PlusEVAnalytics,oh im n overtime trying to show anything about the meaning. im trying to buy  years old you are closing line value from you so youll have no reason to complain anymore when you get +clv and lose...
PlusEVAnalytics,havent studied it in de point h but ive heard that the vig has been increased to the point that n overtime all wong teasers are + expected value anymore you have to be more selective. see  h/t
PlusEVAnalytics,the difference between +0.01 normal and -0.01 inverted is the same as the difference between +0.01 normal and +0.03 normal. recession signals are n overtime binary things...unless everyone believes them so much that they become self fulfilling :(
PlusEVAnalytics,its a free o point ion for you. if the line moves in  years old you are favo you are you can pretend you g overtime the better line or just n overtime enter the bet at all.
aluckyaday,n overtime great but n overtime a disaster either. a single season 4 picks a week is never going to be significant. i guess we will know in 20 years or so if the model is any good
aluckyaday,if anyone wants to calculate the above figures (especially the infinite monkey number) for a tout or even  years old you are own record i have an excel sheet to do it here. based on  yield distribution calculator
aluckyaday,if that is the case then maybe it would be better to improve the general xg calculation to take this in to account? i guess that is n overtime possible if you use a third party xg number.
aluckyaday,interesting. so if i was a vegas book and a subsidiary of mine placed thousands of bets at my opening prices on all my markets and then proceeded to sell those tickets on propswap it would be legal.
aluckyaday,do they n overtime remove the tipsters records in other sports when they become pro for just 1? i believe psycho have confirms this. the fact that deleted accounts have their tips removed also enhances the survivorship bias.
aluckyaday,he is an actuary. probably the hardest profession to qualify for. it is the occupation you would choose if you have the skills to be a pro better but would like to make a l overtime more money!
aluckyaday,no it is not. at high odds you need thousands of results to determine if the returns are significant. you can use the methods here  but i doubt you have enough data to say he is no good.
aluckyaday,doing it that way gives you an expected win/loss for each pick summing them gives you the expected win/loss over all picks. i find that better than just a yes he beat it x  percent  of the time.
aluckyaday,true in some cases and casinos are happy to play on that with their boards showing spin history! but i'm sure there are plenty that go to casinos without the expectation of winning. hope maybe but expectation no.
aluckyaday,real pinney figures for tomorrows premiership game. bad example because there is only a rounding error of 0.001 but.... 1.271/12.8/6.07 margin 2.97 percent  rounded 1.27/12.8/6.07 margin 3.03 percent . so even 0.001 results in a detectable margin change
aluckyaday,"i did n overtime do it either. was staying on the zim side (it was a long time ago) so crossed it to see the zambian side. i remember having to pay the border guard for a ""visa"""
joeyisaks,have you heard of this guy parlay p against the spread hes taken over the sports betting world by doin this. so i believe in him n overtime sure what you talkin about since you arent parlay pats
joeyisaks,there is nobody at these aafl games. steve spurrier is the coach? orlando appolos? who named these teams and why are they in real cities. give these teams to places in iowa or something where people may go?
EdMillerPoker,fair. but definitely the idea is to limit anyone who finds the errors. im basically certain that its better business all the way around to put real effort into n overtime making the errors in the first place.
EdMillerPoker,we plan to keep putting freely available odds on o you are website indefinitely but have no plans to like paywall it or build it out as a subscri point ion service for bettors or what have you.
EdMillerPoker,i think american sports in play should be a timeout product. suspended while the game is in progress goes up at the timeout. i have strong reason to think this paradigm is better for both bettor and book.
EdMillerPoker,well yeah. obv wish more billionaires were bill gates but they're not. and they won't ever be.. personality selection bias etc. frankly i was pretty happy to see multiple ppl pledge so much $ to fix the cathedral.
EdMillerPoker,n overtime defending the moral character of billionaires as a class. obv there's strong selection bias for greedy selfish fuckery among them. but  let us  n overtime pretend fixing humanity's problems is as simple as fixing a roof.
EdMillerPoker,austen seems like a good guy and lambda has an obv value add but i think hes gone way way off the deep end lately dreaming about its ability to scale and continue to add tons of value
EdMillerPoker,if you bet in progress (n overtime in timeout) the odds feed will front run the tv by 10-15 seconds... and then operators insist on tacking on 4-8 more seconds of delay to frontrun you a little more
EdMillerPoker,i have 2 words on my mute for all time list and that is one of them and yet there is  years old you are tweet in my notifcations  what the fuck  tweeter you had one job honestly
nonrandomalpha,l assit week more dogs won su than favorites. how rare of a phenomenon is this? the answer is about once every 19  weeks so less than once a year. are dogs losing value this week? research by
nonrandomalpha,exce point  the bears were dumb enough to offer nearly the same pick and dump eddy. we inadvertently accomplished the o point imal decision thru force of circumstance. n overtime impressed with bears staff at all this season.
nonrandomalpha,this is a very strong point and perhaps one that was even a bit of an oversight by us re browns futures. we know the chemistry will take some time to develop but if baker can't get time...
nonrandomalpha,its a joke demonstrating the triviality of both observations. the fact that 75 percent  of the players are black isnt due to some racist agenda or negative bias against whites by the league. likewise vice versa for coaching.

LeeSharpeNFL,do you use it when both teams are out? or when one can improve but the other is out? i've generally only ignored week 17 for games when one of the teams is in but can't improve seeding.
LeeSharpeNFL,teams in the division all have to be on the same order for the column part to work out. (e.g. bal plays kc and ne next year precisely because they all g overtime 1st place in their divisions).
LeeSharpeNFL,i definitely would expect  it is  more relevant for  college football . i suspect  it is  also useful for nfl but need to look into it more. (and related... how much to weigh priors vs. current season data.)
LeeSharpeNFL,packers punting on 4th and 4 from bears territory. lafle you are goes for it on 4th and 4 from like the 27 or so earlier but here from the 45 or so decides to punt. makes sense.
LeeSharpeNFL,bills wisely down 9 a free throw er the  touchdown  go for 2 now instead of waiting for another score. if you're going to need a 3rd score  it is  better to know that earlier rather than later.
LeeSharpeNFL,also you  daily fantasy sports  wait 2-3 years to evaluate dra free throw  picks. decisions should only be judged based on information available at the time the decision was made. you judge the process n overtime the outcome.
LeeSharpeNFL,hmm really? they were smart to trade ab away. the roster seems pretty solid overall. if roethlisberger hadn't been injured they'd probably be doing well. didn't love fitzpatrick trade but i  daily fantasy sports  think it was terrible.
LeeSharpeNFL,i am impressed with  years old you are desire to own the libs by rooting against  years old you are own team's interest if it final;y proves once and for all that aaron rodgers is n overtime elite.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it sadly didn't fit on the chart so compared to higher wp swing plays so the algorithm removed it but the cowboys field goal in the 4th quarter increased the wp by 1 percent

12Xpert,here's the annual breakdown. obviously i have slightly different data to nish for 2019. i took out walkovers and retirements with 0-0 sets scores as per pinny rules. maybe a few odds errors in the data set too.
12Xpert,a long read. when cry point ocurrency meets ponzi a familiar story of the exploitation of cognitive bias: greed fear (of missing out) ego defence and denial (that when something is too good to be true it is)
12Xpert,what i've never actually done is looked at only genuinely cold teams i.e. scores under 0 versus genuinely h overtime teams scores over 0 only the relative difference so a match with two h overtime teams could qualify.
12Xpert,"""a cultural revolution has been underway... which... perceives the liberalism of the late 20th century as an aberration in a long history of moral distaste for gambling  and seeks to return the activity to the margins of society."""

12Xpert,assuming 2.4 percent  is  years old you are expected long term performance this is the range of things that could have happened over  years old you are 263 tips. 40 percent  chance you could have shown a loss.
12Xpert,claiming this result to be highly statistically significant seems to me to be a stretch. using my yield distribution calculator the spread bets have a p-value of 0.063 the over/unders 0.031. neither are significant at alpha = 0.01.
12Xpert,but this is possible too. and if my theory is correct (it has to be for wocs to work) then this deviation happens by chance. in this example p-value = 0.14 i.e. nothing for me to worry about.
12Xpert,you have just 131 tips in  years old you are records.  let us  talk again when you get to 500 and then 1000. if you're still at 17 percent  roi then from similar odds then it gets interesting.
12Xpert,however i'm glad you believe in complete transparency many  daily fantasy sports  or make excuses for n overtime bothering. but that also means n overtime deleting records when they become unprofitable and starting again under a new name.
12Xpert,yes you're right. i am going to analyse against opening odds hopefully tomorrow. of course we still  daily fantasy sports  know precisely when 538 issue the ratings so we'll never truly be able to make a fair comparison.

RufusPeabody,i met woodland when i was inside the ropes (thanks espn) during a practice round of the 2016 phoenix open. he asked what i made his odds. i told him 43/1. that sounds about right he replied.
RufusPeabody,i couldn't disagree more. sports betting is about getting to test  years old you are own expertise. so much more fun to win based on  years old you are own thought process than someone else's coin flip.

...still waiting...

...and i'm sure they would tell you the deal will be announced any day now if you asked them."
capjack2000,while i agree with  years old you are premise these alt lines markets offer plenty of value when you compare them among all the operators. they end up being 0 percent  vig if you play them right.
capjack2000,"by front loading the fixed costs and back loading the variable costs they're leading operators (and subsequently consumers) into a very poor position (pun intended).

capjack2000,th against the spread interesting  you mind posting a screensh overtime to confirm that? i know people who are limited at fd on prop bets but first ive heard of it on a straight bet like that.
capjack2000,hmm...looks like they took this market down. i was curious what kind of vig they were dealing this market at. i mean it has to be razor thin for them to hawk $20 bets like this right?

dinkinc,i was very close to having a 1-7 exacta but decided on using the 5 instead of the 7.....  n overtime sure how an owner would want to ride him since this is par for the course
dinkinc,i  daily fantasy sports  think so....  the temperature was never close to this...i stopped looking everyday but if it was it would have been in the recent padre series and i am pretty sure those were 12
dinkinc,that seemed pretty important .. stewards knew if they posted an inquiry they would be in a lose-lose sp overtime and just hoped no jockey would claim thinking it would be denied and make them look bad
robpizzola,more than i thought it would be. i still feel like the right thing to do is strip out games where i think mahomes was playing hurt but then im making an already small sample even smaller.

spanky,if you're hesitant then  daily fantasy sports  hang a number. the dressmaker comment was directed at those who wait and see what happens on the next play to decide acce point ance or rejection of the bet.
spanky,he and his group lost way more than any of their betting partners.  no one lost on purpose. they didnt walk away with subscriber money. they went down with the ship. yet you continue to vilify them.
spanky,i hear ya brother... at le assit the senior center g overtime the money and the casino still had to pay.... if the casino woulda g overtime the money back that would have really been a travesty!
spanky,im the wrong guy for picks.....  there are many others you can turn to. i instead will occasionally drop knowledge that has ke point  me on top of the game for the better part of 20 years.
spanky,lots of talk on the toledo total bad beat.... super sharps went u66/65 (loser)... semi sharps went u64/63 (loser)... sharp followers went u62/61 (loser).... theres this one sharp guy spanky who went u68.5 (winner)... price is everything
DocBettor,n overtime a promo or anything just sharing what i thought was a good product experience. if you  daily fantasy sports  care about the betting data and just want to have the scores i would recommend flashscore.
PlusEVAnalytics,how worried are we about one directional parameter uncertainty this week? eg the market expects dak to play and if hes out the line will move a ton. will it move at all if/when hes confirmed in?
PlusEVAnalytics,"1 theyre the luckiest n overtime the best
2 theyre n overtime picking against the same lines you are
3 they might be considering some game theory elements that would be irrelevant to you
but carry on"
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont believe th against the spread true and even if i did this would be a poor example of it. this is random variance that o you are brains trick us into seeing as a pattern.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah im with you on that its the collective market is coordinated enough to actively set traps for bad models instead of just letting them pick 50 percent  and lose the vig that im n overtime buying.
aluckyaday,sad day. i will never forget my 200/1 for his incredible mandela day win in the to you are flying p assit an amazed pin overtime and bardet. until this year my biggest ever priced cycling winner.
aluckyaday,weird i meant high. no idea why i typed low. yes i would think it would be based on profiling. my definition of recreational is someone who betting without skill. pretty much random negative expected value bets.
aluckyaday,you have to be very careful n overtime fall in to the trap of assuming increased returns are due to something you are doing and n overtime just down to the increase in variance kelly betting produces.
aluckyaday,so neil woodford was talented... until he was not. he does n overtime pass the n overtime tipster qualification though. i guess there is a difference between an opinion of someones ability and actually knowing for sure.
aluckyaday,"i'm sure the guys they are a free throw er the $10 recreationals will be glad of a ""free"" $100. the beauty of sports betting is there is a fresh supply of 21 year olds every day"
aluckyaday,its a way to gamble that provides the same reward to the brain as a fobt/online casino just n overtime as o free throw en. if you ban one way to gamble addicts will always find another.
aluckyaday,its a marketing game n overtime a bookmaking one. the best marketing companies will win and the european companies have had lots of practice! it will be interesting to see if the american brands can fight back.
aluckyaday,but that tiny handful of firms initial model opinion is pretty damn good. i would think it is action based on better data that is causing then to move lines rather than better opinions /  punter models.
aluckyaday,what will happen when thousands of us citizens start stealing from their employers to pay for that addiction? who should pay for the social cost of gambling is a h overtime topic in europe at the moment.
aluckyaday,if i was betting kelly it would depend on what i though my edge was but by the time i g overtime to the 20th spin i would have thought the stake would have gone up significantly.
aluckyaday,the line will never be correct just more efficient on average. you assume the line is inefficient because pinneys model is worse than yours. i believe it is because of other reasons you do n overtime know.
aluckyaday,or maybe it is because more information comes to the market. do you really believe  years old you are little excel model is better than pinnacles sports model? you may have better data but a better model......
aluckyaday,nice feeling when you are updating  years old you are betting history and you see that a result was amended in  years old you are favour! turned a break evenish day in to a 100+ point one
theFirmAISports,yeah plus that game wasnt overly exciting. i love this conce point  that youre going thru. ive always thought about doing it but never have the time. when you finish the analysis id love to see it!

EdMillerPoker,there are several niches and each can be filled by one operator. for the big niche probably two big brands and a handful of smaller ones. i think 5 is low. but 10 might n overtime be.

LeeSharpeNFL,"packers: aaron rodgers

JoeyKnish22,i played it. but real small considering neither team has a real qb and it appears these teams literally want to kill each other so i think youll get defenses locked in for a nasty dog fight.
JoeyKnish22,if you sent me a dm about getting in late i apologize the pool filled up quick. have just under 300 entries to process which is more than we originally planned n overtime looking to take anymore.
JoeyKnish22,was thinking (outside of the charity rake) if the winner wanted to donate a portion of their winnings to a charity of their own choice i would match it up to a certain dollar amount. (say $500).
JoeyKnish22,i told the untold michigan state football program history of peds story a few weeks ago which people seemed to enjoy. so as the dantonio era burns to ash lets unearth some more local secrets shall we?
JoeyKnish22,the story about getting stiffed for 24  million in malaysian baccarat is pretty insane im still n overtime fully sure i understand what happened lol. but i feel better about my largest stiff only being about $1500.
JoeyKnish22,well played 1h but when you dont convert those chances usually comes back to bite you. also reggie cannon is  years old you are starting rb. permanently been that good. get morris the fuck off the pitch.

LockyLockerson,add all that up you get 10-8 and since these are all widely-available -110 scenarios...congratulations!  i haven't lost you any money.  you've won a little.  i'll add to this thread in subsequent weeks since that was easy.
LockyLockerson,i'm glad y'all are in on this fiba thing but i am n overtime even close to ready for basketball to be back on my tv.  the ra point ors won the title like 9 weeks ago.
LockyLockerson,fun fact: 5dimes currently has about 100 players listed with odds with the nfl mvp this year.  the team with the most players listed? denver (6).  no that doesn't make any sense.  but  it is  kinda funny.
LockyLockerson,we've done 2 exercises similar to this throughout the season.  i ended up (n overtime planning ahead of time) picking michigan state as the champion both times.  eli picked seton hall and...i forget the second time.  kentucky?
LockyLockerson,looking forward to discussing first impressions of both games tomorrow on  with   i knew i would like one of the teams based on what the spreads were going to open and the opener did n overtime disappoint.

Gingfacekillah,i was unsure whether to add a home court advantage to this one. technically i suppose usa was at home? either way looks like a promising early sign for my player based model. more testing to come.
Gingfacekillah,and as per  years old you are contrarian method these biases seem to appear at the team level as a random walk. looking at it from too high a level can obfuscate the value of these inefficiencies.

tons of plays of #chalkcity this weekend. *prays in korean*"
PikachuBets,"he's part of a company whose ultimate goal (one of many) is to become affiliates of sportsbooks and generate revenue from the  percent  losses of referred clients. do you understand why he roots ""for the dealer"" now?"
adamchernoff,no plans on a pdf version but i have a few ideas to make it better. one thing is for sure and that is i will be starting on it much earlier than i did in 2019.
adamchernoff,may i add if folks on twitter would like to know how big of a deal it can be if they are close to 100 percent  they can listen to the fantastic interview below on this link:
adamchernoff,i think this goes back to the misleading ca point ion. my anticipation of how well the ne pass attack could look tonight against hou was the crutch of the handicap explained in the 2 minute video.
adamchernoff,"i  daily fantasy sports  know about this...

is he trying to say teams can win a football game by n overtime ""setting the tone early"" and trying to ""punch  years old you are opponent in the mouth""?"
adamchernoff,"spending new years eve in traditional fashion - prepping for wildcard weekend.  

rewatching eagles games with foles having a pint and finishing work for the simple handicap in the morning. 

enjoy  years old you are evening !"
adamchernoff,my appearance on  with  and  this week was as informative of a podc assit as i have ever done. awesome information to make you money tomorrow against the spread and fantasy. you guys will love this episode:
Ccon8181,early one sided responses. lets get a larger sample size #sportsbetting twitter. if responses are this one sided then maybe we should demand more from the industry.. and those who profit off of it by providing advise.
Ccon8181,although i kinda want all the people who bet on the #browns (majority of ppl who bet on the game) to feel a taste of the pain ive felt over the l assit two years. haha #brownsjets
kellyinvegas,i tried to reply but you deleted  years old you are tweet  seb has been silenced so... either way i owe you clowns nothing. just to myself. i bet at 4 spots in town. banned from 2.
kellyinvegas,nope. never done that. hence why on the  and  shows we talk about the current line on that specific day. just like on sunday i took the push with the browns when in reality i had -2.5.
ToddFuhrman,unfortunately theres no way to police by tech. i agree its n overtime right but the only way to avoid any of it is to avoid technology in general and th against the spread n overtime possible
ToddFuhrman,as a native chicagoan (n overtime a cubs fan) my buddies there would love it but has to be right fit. hes going to be old school and hold players accountable definitely n overtime a players manager
ToddFuhrman,"today 11a eastern on  reacting to yesterdays college games previewing oklahoma vs houston and explaining what all the nfl trades over the weekend mean to division odds.

spend  years old you are sunday morning with       and me"
ToddFuhrman,i think the biggest fear with kyler is that he's n overtime playing for a veteran head coach with a proven track record of success; kliff may be seeking answers himself all too o free throw en
ToddFuhrman,"probably should have specified power 5 regarding uconn; that was a whole other level of incompetent for sure

what's the early buzz on the ground floor around the culture change and impact satterfield can have year 1?"
ToddFuhrman,"balls are no doubt juiced and as a guy who loves great pitching its hard to watch but its what the game wants and there are some elite hitters out there

picked joc on  during yesterdays show"
ToddFuhrman,i still cant figure out why all the #g overtime fanboys out there cant admit this season has lacked everything weve come to expect from the show; its ok to be salty about n overtime meeting expectations
ToddFuhrman,"for those always asking about the best sports weekends to come to vegas here's how i'd personally rank them

1) march madness opening weekend
2) superbowl
3) conference tournament week
4) kentucky derby 
5) any football weekend"
TheCousinSal,i honestly couldn't give a crap what you focus on. sure the majority of his sports gambling takes are misguided but  is a good dude. perhaps you're confusing him with mark fuhrman - the racist oj cop?
TheCousinSal,hard to believe that in this day and age - with constant free-flowing information - you can still 2 minutes before the dra free throw  bet on who the #1 pick will be. (mayfield favored at -225)
TheCousinSal,dandy game between kansas and baylor. i dont think anyone would be bummed to see both of these teams get a 1 seed. come to think of it - i actually dont think anyone cares either way.
TheCousinSal,top 7 in accuracy this year + #1 in  touchdown  passes...but he's having trouble hitting a cutout windmill while wearing swe against the spread and a tactical sun hat on a random off-season friday morning. another  classic!
12Xpert,i've been closed a free throw er 1 bet. a question: have you been restricted by other bookmakers before this one? if the answer is yes you have  years old you are explanation. they just share data.
12Xpert,well that is interesting. n overtime statistically significant in my book. who is top 5 and how many sigma? what's the total number of players? what does the cumulative distribution look like? sorry for all the questions.
12Xpert,interestingly every team below the top 6 as ranked by average and max with the exce point ion of everton have been relegated at some point. this would seem to indicate that everton's time may be due.
12Xpert,"getting a second airing in 24 hours; people's capacity for expressing bias is fascinating.
""fundamental attribution error: the tendency to overestimate the action of others as being intentional rather than the product of random situational circumstances. """
12Xpert,"its like asking about the length of string. 

there are quicker ways like comparing  years old you are odds to closing odds but that requires markets to be efficient and n overtime everyone subscribes to this idea."
12Xpert,unfortunately i haven't ready it and  daily fantasy sports  know much about high frequency trading in sports betting markets. it will certain add volume and i would imagine it increases efficiency.  is probably the guy to ask.
12Xpert,every now and again you come across a story th against the spread worth telling but for sure its so depressing that so many athletes and trainers show complete disregard for the people that matter: the fans.
12Xpert,these are tips at a sharp bookmaker n overtime some tinp overtime recreational like unibet who ban you for exploiting generous odds compilers. are you able to return a sustainable profit from pinnacle over thousands of bets?
12Xpert,of course every general election this country gets to decide whether it wants to be governed by a party who membership is such a stereotyped demographic. and most of the time in history it has chosen it.
JambosPicks,tonight turned out to be the wrong night to fade madison bumgarner as madbum and the #s field goal iants hold a 3-1 lead a free throw er 5 to squash o you are #padres (f5) play.
mschwimer,my recommendation would be to dm jeff or rufus with all  years old you are questions. if this happens i give you my word that i will answer every single question. even if it takes 4 hours!
mschwimer,sign up for free and you will see! o you are record includes all o you are recommendations that are time stamped with the book we used so you can see all lines and when we post.
mschwimer,today's podcast.  ironically we went 4-1 yesterday on .  i didn't do a best bet on espn but if i did it would have been the one game i lost.  hard to come from behind and beat
mschwimer,full disclosure. i sent espn my best bet when loyola chicago was +10. but when the line moved to +8 they absolutely gave me the opportunity to switch it but i chose to ride. 01 is 0-1.
RufusPeabody,impossible to do this well on all games and n overtime be running above expectation. i suspect you have a l overtime of games where you make it a 51 percent  cover probability. helluva run though.
RufusPeabody,i think  is conflating closing line value with value against the closing line. closing line value is difference (or edge depending on how you define it) between closing line implied prob and bet line implied prob.
RufusPeabody,2) incentives to pick more games (and/or smaller markets) if theyre losing or fewer games if theyre winning near the endpoint of the subscri point ion. nowhere do they say they wont release props for example.
RufusPeabody,literally *everybody* is on a h overtime streak  its meaningless. exhibit a:  on a 1-18 streak and h overtime streaks are front and center. at le assit give the customers information to make an educated decision.
RufusPeabody,arbitrary endpoints makes this meaningless to me. if theory is bigger favorites are more undervalued you can test that effect with simple regression. but i wouldnt expect either of these trends to be profitable moving forward.
RufusPeabody,their ceo emailed me before they launched. he said the right things. i said i hope it plays out that way. but will hill says the right things; doing the right things is a different story.
RufusPeabody,my close friend thomas goodman is launching his nonprofit today!  aims to address something overlooked far too long -- availability of healthy plant-based o point ions in low-income communities. please consider donating to this worthwhile cause!
RufusPeabody,the year clarke won it there was a huge weather advantage for one side of the draw. ditto year stenson won. would require a little bit of digging to find but ill take a look tomorrow
RufusPeabody,random factoid from prop research: the l assit two seasons with patrick mahomes at qb the chiefs have gone for it on every single 4th-and-1 in plus territory but only gone for it once on 4th-and-2.
jeffma,new episode of  where i attack  for being a media whore and we compare pick sellers to drug dealers... plus a few college and nfl picks and the argument for a futures bet on ohio state
SportsCheetah,its a continual process as markets and sports evolve but an easy and efficient comparison to make if youre doing  years old you are own projections is between yours and the closing lines in the market.
SportsCheetah,next week on bet the process: why joe burrow has no sh overtime at winning the heisman even in a convincing alabama win and will the rounders guy please stay out of o you are mentions.
SportsCheetah,"haha thanks

capjack2000,"i think they see it already. the wheels turn slowly but mobile registration and mobile banking within the app are definitely on the way for nv. 

if i had to guess i'd say within 6-9 months."
capjack2000,no date for online launch yet. my guess is it will be several months before mobile betting will be live. hopefully faster than the 6 months between bm and mobile launches like we saw in pa.
capjack2000,good point. streamed broadc assit on this is about 7 seconds behind the on-air broadc assit (which is 7-12 seconds behind live). so if you're using this for in-game betting you'll want to bet between innings.
capjack2000,"if  is holding up hundreds of millions in business then  should use some of their muscle to push the issue.

capjack2000,jay kornegay was just lobbed a so free throw ball to talk about superbook moving into nj but he ducked out of the way of the pitch. no word yet on superbook plans in nj  #bosamerica
dinkinc,i was out once when i was eight...they said start counting backwards from 100... i g overtime down to 97 ... strange the stuff you remember... chocolate and vanilla mixed ice cream a free throw er
dinkinc,i thought we made more progress than we have.... thanks for  years old you are hard work... the problem is the more you try to fix it the more the public learns how bad it is...
dinkinc,0-1 today for the   horses.... just went to get something from my rent a car and went face to face with a skunk... likely someone telling me about my baseball opinion the l assit two weeks
dinkinc,"here's a train of thought i didn't see coming..... ""hmm so  it is  sale vs dillon peters.... what's the best way to extract value out of this..... i guess angels first five innings ""   go figure"
dinkinc,"i  daily fantasy sports  blame people who were fooled at all... there was a comment under andrea's picture saying "" this is why i never donate to rescues ""  ..  i understand why she said that..."
dinkinc,in an era where horses still go to slaughter tracks are unsafe to race and super trainers use all sorts of drugs o you are biggest concern seems to be are we overpunishing dangerous riding..   #buthewasthebesthorse
dinkinc,1-1 nhl ...1-1 horse props 0-2 mlb...lose isles series.... bunch of tough loses but we have had some luckbox wins of late.... the  horses preach no whining just winning so i am calling it a night
robpizzola,you can adjust any/a based off of era as well which would give a boost to qbs that didnt play in a pass heavy league. there are plenty of other good metrics to use as well.
robpizzola,those are all ones that ive posted to twitter before so was pretty easy to find them in my timeline. gotta post those ones every now and then to give people the impression that i win!
robpizzola,that roughing the passer on the raiders was an awful call. if theyre going to allow pi to be reviewed might as well extend it to roughing the passer because they get half of these wrong.
RASPicks,yeah i have no clue either n overtime defending him at all but probably n overtime a fair comparison given that the running game thre against the spread opposing defenses and score/time situations were totally different.
RASPicks,what would you pay for? better info? better data? better numbers? better outs? if n overtime even considering the possibility that paying for something could increase  years old you are edge you are likely missing something.
RASPicks,ras 2019 nflx service is now available. 36-18 since ince point ion of service two years ago with significant closing line value on nearly every release. please visit   and .  questions? dm here or email admin
RASPicks,n overtime to mention the track record was only one season.  if a tout was selling picks a free throw er one season you and  would be all in on what a bad idea that is!
RASPicks,two weeks ago was o you are worst closing line value of the season and we went 5-2.  l assit week was o you are best closing line value of the season and we went 3-4.
VegasRefund,cant explain how much i appreciate all the loyal followers out there. i legit havent looked at my comments in a while now so please dont think im n overtime appreciative.. ill recognize you all soon.
ProfessorShine,the wiscy\tosu big10 final situation few years back was obvious a free throw er the half.   only chance tosu had to leapfrog tcu was to crush.  it happened and no one but seth mentioned the laydown.
suuma810,"football is coming and here's my jacksonville #jaguars 2019 team preview!

ClevTA,who besides pouncey is out? he will be back by then bc the gm is 4 weeks away. allen on the road against that d is trouble imo. they obv need juju to recover in time
ClevTA,barkley's run schedule is brutal in the near future. if u can get into the playoffs tho its cake with miami and wash. plus hunt may take some snaps away from chubb so its a risk
ClevTA,yikes. browns literally set an nfl record l assit year thru 3 gms with almost 4 takeaways per gm yet they couldnt win a gm bc tyrod completed 49 percent  of his throws. he was awful
ClevTA,correct. th against the spread always #1. running out of spread formation is #2. i was just saying its n overtime some cute play freddie made up the rams and many others run that same play
ClevTA,right so for me based on his situation and talent/coaching in 2017 vs today i think about a 4.5 rank improvement is fair. hes still n overtime good but hes better than bottom quartile of starters
CizzlingSports,i guess we'll see if he keeps the loosing pickz entirely behind the pay wall this season - must admit aside from n overtime selling pickz at all  it is  a smart play given the results
spanky,while it would be nice to receive a welcome package from  i'll be just as happy n overtime receiving a limit cut or kick out the door.  i'm pretty excited to start firing at no juice!
spanky,its funny how you jokers conclude how i get my info.  very few lines move without me knowing who what where when and why.  if you think its tickers you are sadly mistaken.  keep hatin though
spanky,"says i had bad behavior when i never even entered the joint. fact is they  daily fantasy sports  welcome winners... 
heres my 3rd nj banning (part 1): 

 supervisor jafrasia shook my hand and laughed with me."
PlusEVAnalytics,wh against the spread a good investment strategy for someone who believes that growth is overrated (and possibly evil)? buy stocks with high dividend yield? short everything th against the spread sexy and in the news?
PlusEVAnalytics,when my syndicate tried to make a large bet into a minus pool we g overtime a sternly worded letter from o you are tote supplier - dont do that again or well kick you out.
PlusEVAnalytics,"the 12th worst team in the nba is the hornets heat or pacers. they are mediocre.

in the wnba they would be the best team.

the wnba needs to improve. 

(see how dumb that logic is?)"
aluckyaday,they also have more information than the analytics companies. that said we  daily fantasy sports  get to see the predictions of the best analytics companies. the likes of starlizard keep what they are betting on quiet!
aluckyaday,they ain't seen nothing yet! wait until people start losing their homes and stealing from them employers to feed their addiction. how are us legislators going to react to that when it happens. and it will.....
aluckyaday,the algorithm used is way down the list of what is important. getting the basics right selecting features regularization (guess the choice of algorithm could be helpful here) and proper testing gets you a long way!
aluckyaday,ok its a distribution rather than a number. but a number that will cover 95 percent  of possibilities would suffice i'd prefer 99 percent  and 99.9 percent  but as you  daily fantasy sports  believe in luck....
aluckyaday,n overtime sure it was his point of view. it was his way of trying to regain control of the party. but what he thought was an odds on gamble went the way of the outsider!
aluckyaday,depending on the irish situation an american deal is n overtime a given. can't be done without congress approval. going on how the us treat canada and mexico i doubt the uk will get great terms!
aluckyaday,if as a society we are going to allow gambling identifying and interacting with those with a problem is the only viable o point ion. driving the problem underground or offshore is n overtime a solution.
aluckyaday,you could try asking them why it is n overtime available. i though you could just find it in the full show but for some reason the full show is there but does n overtime play
aluckyaday,yep for the big firms the liabilities are just too big. its n overtime as if they have blocked all multiples. just ones that are going to rack up huge liabilities which seems sensible to me.
aluckyaday,has done a study of one tipster supermarket showing the profit a free throw er fees and price slippage. his bet placement is automatic so done pretty much instantaneously. manually the slippage would probably be more.
theFirmAISports,besides building models for predicting games we also do nlp text mining/analysis etc. we might have even created deep learning models that impersonate users in gambling twitter..aka chatbots..to start here are most freq used words by

nonrandomalpha,like wow henry ford was moron could only invest the shitty model t couldnt even come up with 400hp electric sports car. fuckn dumbass. elon musk is obviously a superior human and visionary than henry ford.
nonrandomalpha,listen i know beating the lions twice the giants and a crumbling cowboys team gave you a l overtime of misplaced confidence but next three games are nothing like the l assit 4. get a grip.
nonrandomalpha,calloway paid 10x more than me to spend less time catching a ball. so just do that isnt that the whole point of being paid millions? or is it to only make the easiest of catches?
nonrandomalpha,"nfl week 1 is in the books. how'd we do? 

2019 super contest: 4-1
2019 circa million: 4-0-1
betkarma core sportfolio: 5-0 

listen to o you are week 1 recap and preview of week 2 spreads..."
nonrandomalpha,also worth noting that i couldnt bless the ravens -7.5 to open l assit v peterson-led bills and ravens blew the doors off them. nonetheless these are just the type of plays that make me recoil.
LeeSharpeNFL,"there are fo you are days in january (counting new years as a day off) that aren't either a workday (assuming a m-f office job) or days with nfl playoff games.

LeeSharpeNFL,"they always planned to have 3 games today with matchups to be determined later. i forget when they made the selections i think about a month ago?

(also learned the amazing phrase ""trigger coefficient"" and was surprised that josh's favorite drink wasn't wine.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,it is in play but a l overtime has to go right for you. unlikely ne loses to mia or cin. that means you have to win out including beating pit and ne on the road.
LeeSharpeNFL,"there are times where i feel you are doing the former and time where i feel you are doing the latter if that helps? :)

i've always assumed  years old you are intent is the latter!"
LeeSharpeNFL,he did. he didn't play week 4 vs.  minutes (well he did but a tiny # of plays) nor week 5 vs. oak in london. week 6 was the bye. he played week 7 vs. no.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""the first half of the 49ers schedule has faces easy offenses so we should adjust for that in o you are projections moving forward.""

""wow  daily fantasy sports  you know a data set can be biased?"""
whale_capper,cringeworthy because you think were using it incorrectly or because you dont think pointing out who is calling offense in a way that is o point imal for winning games is an effective way to handicap?
whale_capper,even for the bigger pools like sides and totals the public  percent tages are questionable when you get into derivatives like team totals  it is  even more noisy... was there an angle you're trying to evalaute?
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  think the margin on paper is high enough to keep a company like dunder mifflin solvent.  the payroll for a three-person in-house accounting d expected points added rtment alone must be staggering.
AndyMSFW,"just realized i have no early action... guess i'm just a huge vag and will watch soccer and basketball instead.

everything i played this week:
giants tto 20.5 -105
dallas over 44 -105
sf -2.5 -106"
AndyMSFW,i thought a big part of tonight was going to be the raven's blitz packages vs goff but that isn't gonna matter if the ravens just score a  touchdown  every time they get the damn ball.
AndyMSFW,when adjusting for home court what if any adjustment are you going to make for a team playing in a different arena in the same town that they are based in? (like charleston or norfolk st.)
AndyMSFW,you might have better luck with a rolling  moneyline bet or 3 leg open parlay on their ml's than that.  honestly now that i'm saying it i might end up with a better price that way!
JoeyKnish22,correct. you can change  years old you are pick on any game up until kickoff of that game. once a game kickoffs you can see everyones picks. spreads on sides and totals wont change theyre locked.
JoeyKnish22,n overtime as bullish on rexy is on army today but i absolutely love ksu in the bowl game vs navy as well. klieman owns the o point ion and 3 weeks of prep for it.
JoeyKnish22,the game has been over legislated. too many rules too much subjectivity too many reviews. it takes the instant joy out of a big play because youre always on edge waiting for a flag or review.
JoeyKnish22,th against the spread how generic 2-3 star recruit x becomes all conference player time a free throw er time a free throw er time then turns into  in the nfl where more rigorous testing exist.

TheKostos,ravens aren't going anywhere browns would have upgraded at coach by hiring an office chair bengals gonna get a massive upgrade at qb with burrow... and ben roethlisberger can't stop pounding big macs. good luck pittsburgh
TheKostos,doesn't really matter. trump isn't losing in this economy. especially n overtime to bernie sanders.  that is  just a fact. people can get upset if they want but  it is  like saying the sky is blue
TheKostos,anyone interested in yeezys ive g overtime a number of pairs (350/500/700) in sizes 10 or 10.5 im looking to move. original box for almost all and all in great condition. hit me up if interested

LockyLockerson,"nothing on either college game tonight but plenty standing out for tomorrow.  

hockey may be quiet as well but there is one potential edge i think we will have later.

LockyLockerson,well everyone whether it was memphis on thursday arizona state l assit night or 6-3-1 today hopefully i helped you have more winners than losers this week.  enjoy the rest of  years old you are weekend!
LockyLockerson,incase you missed it : have gotten a l overtime of great feedback on the  podcast from l assit night a great 90 minutes to get you ready for college football in less than a month!
LockyLockerson,i know theres a contrarian opinion of like whatever guys this is an amazing show you dorks just wouldnt be happy no matter what but this disaster of a finale isnt doing great things for yall
LockyLockerson,kansas but the difference in quality among 8-9's actually makes the simulations pretty wild.  if you swap some teams around in that game specifically (like going from texas tech to wisconsin) it really mixes things up.

chadmillman,"first  and now this!

--input  years old you are futures (i g overtime texans  saints at 20-1).

Gingfacekillah,i'm n overtime here to lecture anyone about how the exponential function works. it is shocking though how  rapid the onset can be. italy laughed the whole thing off about 3 weeks ago and then boom.
Gingfacekillah,the process of maximizing the mean total value (bankroll growth) derived from a bettor's available bets. there is some discussion about whether mean or median bankroll utility is more appropriate. see post by  (more math ahead).
Gingfacekillah,enter results as they come in at the bottom of the existing data in the elo rating function sheet then populate the elo ratings down. in this example i've added the nep/mia game from this week.
Gingfacekillah,i find it humorous that someone that writes poorly written sports betting articles with zero math calls everyone he doesnt like a tout. perhaps writing about sports betting is only allowed when adam boothe does it?
Gingfacekillah,the application is a touch extreme but i agree with the ethos. have had many 10 ho you are days exploring a new edge. if youve g overtime decent systems it should get more efficient eventually.
Gingfacekillah,one addition: occasionally take a non-market best line from them that still appears + expected value to  years old you are calculations if possible. algos easily detect a bettor exclusively picking off the market best lines.
Gingfacekillah,does anyone know generally how i would apply this ensemble model to a new dataset so that i can apply the model to new game forec assits n overtime included in the test or train data?
Gingfacekillah,like the first card counter being asked to leave a casino. you have to know square books won't take kindly to having their lines picked off. stealth is the name of the game for line grinders.

adamchernoff,as bad as the ne schedule has been theyve played well in each. ten is a big step up from average but its strength on strength in that case. most difficult opponent for ten this season.
adamchernoff,"if that is what you took away then you completely misunderstood the thread. i explained why following the idea of ""reverse line movement"" puts you in the most disadvantageous sp overtime to win betting on sports."
adamchernoff,any thoughts or insight on the surface for sunday? first time the natural grass surface is being retracted for the turf master artificial surface. about 25mm forecasted in rain the 24 hours leading up to kick.
adamchernoff,in play markets are a great way to find value in nfl betting but most bettors go about it the wrong way. here are a couple different thought processes to consider when betting nfl in play.
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  know any other way but friends in high places suggest to me on a routine basis that my sense of dressing for occasion is very low. so it is a tricky call.
adamchernoff,"i rebuttal each of those points in this episode: 

i dont try predict the future but rather weigh price vs probability. difficult to say any other nfc team has more upside vs their price than gb."
adamchernoff,"the simple handicap daily previews continue on apple  spotify with the falcons. 

will dirk koetter revert to 2012? 
how does an o-line built for zone blocking adjust to a power scheme?

TheCousinSal,fonzie jumped the shark again!!!  and this time his efforts earned him the 14th annual #jimmykimmellive pedestrian belly flop championship. congr against the spread to my pal hank winkler.  (i call him hank. were that close)
TheCousinSal,im starting to get weirdly intrigued by this  team.  4.5 games out of the second wild card sl overtime with white sox pirates and marlins next 7 on the docket.  its august ....and were still alive!!
TheCousinSal,this week on #againstallodds the degenerate trifecta  i discuss o you are brooks koepka pga win bucks/ra point ors game 5 bets stanley cup odds + the worst tv finales of all-time (apologies to alf). #gambling
TheCousinSal,heres all you need to know when deciding if army/navy is the best rivalry in college football. have you ever in  years old you are life watched an entire army/navy game? wow - what a shocker!
TheCousinSal,on an all-new #againstallodds the degenerate trifecta  i tackle nfl best bets rapid-fire props puck futures + we decide which sports figure would make the best supreme court justice. spoiler alert:  it is  n overtime oj.
TheCousinSal,they are now saying the counter missed a full plate and that chestnut ate 74 h overtime dogs...n overtime 64 ...which kills my best bet of under 70.5.  i need to quit gambling right this second.
12Xpert,this is exactly what happens in the favourite-longsh overtime bias. bookmakers can lengthen favourites knowing that punters will still back the longshots but ensuring that the favourites are still n overtime quite offering value (on average).
12Xpert,the football governing bodies have always been hypocrites when it comes to money happy to charge non profit-making fan sites thousands to show fixtures for just their club until the ecj told them this was bullshit.
12Xpert,yes  that is  right at this scale. like i showed with the anchor bias articles there can be inefficiency in a sample of prices which disappears when those samples are aggregated with a poorer odds resolution.
12Xpert,"""hardly any research is conducted into the benefits of gambling (in contravention of the principles of public health and basic common sense) and those researchers who do acce point  industry funding (for whatever purpose) are vilified."""
12Xpert,that is  all i am doing here. in this case i'm using opening/to closing because  that is  the data i have. for soccer  it is  close to a perfect correlation implying closing is close to efficient.
12Xpert,whatever it is the earth won't end life won't end humans will ada point  (they are good at that) and doomsdayers and deniers in equal measure will still continue to spout shite they know little about.
12Xpert,"even if that means tossing coins for them? that makes you as sinful as me then  daily fantasy sports  it?
""i'm n overtime tossing coins.""
oh really then prove it.
""look at my profit dumb ass!""."
12Xpert,belonging to the eu might be good for other things like labo you are rights health and safety and standards and quality of goods but you didn't promote that argument. yours was about trade and tariffs.
12Xpert,good for you. so then all you need to do is to get enough people to agree with you that you are right and then you get what you want.  it is  how this thing works.
12Xpert,gambling is about divining or gaining control over an unknown future. arguably the drawing of cave paintings tens of thousands of years ago was a means of story telling used to divine the prospects of hunts.
12Xpert,"plenty of references in my book. fama did a pretty good job.
fama e. f.  french k. r. 2010. luck versus skill in the cross-section of mutual fund returns. the journal of finance 65(5) pp. 1915-1947."
12Xpert,i assume what im seeing here is stronger biases and hence bigger book margins where there are teams with long/short odds. th against the spread what appears to have changed in p assit couple of years.
12Xpert,i guess the real problem is that on a case by case basis we have no idea what the true odds should be so we have no idea how accurate something else is relative to it.

mschwimer,absolutely. which is why this business model is completely unsustainable. it will work for a short amount of time. we will n overtime offer a subscri point ion service if we cant consistently beat closing lines.

suuma810,if they convert they are around the hou 48. 12-15 yards to go for a vinatieri  field goal  with a timeout is realistic. if they dont burn the first to they would have had two.

aluckyaday,because people need to trade currencies people  daily fantasy sports  need to trade sports. the global economy does n overtime depend on it you are trying to make sports betting something that it is not!
aluckyaday,i would have though it would have increased with the extra publicity for sports betting. so maybe the 2 are cancelling each other out gained some new business but lost some old to other states?
aluckyaday,limits are personal with these kind of books. they profile you and allow you a percentage of the house limit depending on how they see you. spanky's limits may be different to yours or mine.
aluckyaday,to maintain the uk union it would have to be a special case for the uk n overtime northern ireland. which i doubt is ever going to be politically acce point able to the eu.

aluckyaday,usually? so you are saying more than 50 percent  of touts are only giving out selective information to make themselves look good? how many more? what kind of percentage figure would you put on it?

LeeSharpeNFL,"each team's movement from before vs. a free throw er l assit week (week 13) of its chances to...

1) make the playoffs
2) win their division
3) get a bye
4) earn homefield advantage"
LeeSharpeNFL,i wasn't breaking it down by field position but a l overtime of this matches what i was looking at when examining series conversion this p assit offseason (so this is call pre-2019 data) but:
whale_capper,ill refresh my memory on who hes taken in the first two rounds over the l assit ten years but the hit rate is something like 20 percent  compared to league avg of ~40-50 percent
whale_capper,if you keep sending requests for review and it moves up the chain they may resolve it fairly... if n overtime id submit a report to sbr and see how f assit they fix it
AndyMSFW,"i think the market did a nice job adjusting l assit year as it is prone to do.

weeks 1-4 the over was 68-58 (avg total 45.8)
we finished the year 244-278-12 (avg total 46.7)"
AndyMSFW,every year i'm befuddled by how the powers that be decided to put together the nfl preseason schedule but i guess i'll just roll with it like always and enjoy the giant-ass thursday slate. #nfl100
JoeyKnish22,i love when people with locked accounts comment on a post when you dont follow them. sir. you are aware nobody can see this response exce point  you and the 30 unlocked followers of yours.
JoeyKnish22,apologize for n overtime announcing beforehand but the idea just hit us with haydens tweet. if you have already entered and have any issue youre free to request a refund no offense will be taken.
JoeyKnish22,first up the folks at  were very generous this holiday season.  must have g overtime laid this week. theyve g overtime a $250 risk free bet on bears/lions with only 1x rollover if it loses.
JoeyKnish22,put his qb in a game he likely shouldnt have started and definitely shouldnt have still been in in turn potentially costing him millions (no sh overtime at #1 pick now). he should feel bad.
JoeyKnish22,i mean coaches can barely get in game strategy right; so season strategy is probably a long way off but maybe hire some asian math guys like the colts  i do n overtime know .
JoeyKnish22,anybody thinking of parlaying the jets and browns again this week?? dont have any money le free throw  but ive g overtime some furniture and tools id be willing to trade for a parlay ticket
JoeyKnish22,yeah theyll get paid soon enough. a free throw er this season i wouldnt play another snap if i was either of those guys until i g overtime a deal commensurate with the other 2.
TheKostos,i really dont think its an insult to say tyreek and kelce are better than arob. were talking one of the very best and the very best at their respective positions. arob is still awesome
TheKostos,"one episode in and love is blind might be the dumbest shit i've ever watched. people get engaged a free throw er five days? foh. absolute lunacy.

that being said definitely watching the second episode."
TheKostos,a free throw er conferring with some trusted advisors i have played rafa nadal -9 in his upcoming match against who the hell cares he's gonna job to nadal. major degen night for yours truly.
TheKostos,n overtime sure how old you are but the bengals were the browns before the browns were the browns and probably worse. so i  daily fantasy sports  blame older bengals fans for being super jaded
TheKostos,im max betting either the vikings or niners in the nfc title game bc theres no way the football gods will allow either the shitty seahawks or shitty packers to play for a super bowl
LockyLockerson,if you ever question the validity of this playoff predictor espn uses theyve g overtime oklahoma at 55 percent  to make it this morning and...well...im gonna say th against the spread just a bit off

LockyLockerson,nba a free throw ernoon updates and projections published to the patreon page!  a busy night one of the busier since i started the channel.  lots of really interesting games injury news and possible edges.
LockyLockerson,with a very light nba schedule for today and n overtime much in the way of value i wrote the day-time updates already over at patreon.  a couple injuries worth monitoring and some other thoughts.
LockyLockerson,also happy to announce i've bet on almost every atrocious fbs team in the country this season but there's one i haven't and that will change saturday.  holding out for maybe a half point more.

EliHershkovich,point was it was steamed down to around 124 at some books.  it is  all about searching for the best number. i wouldn't turn it down either but the hook matters more than you realize.
EliHershkovich,"golden state just shi free throw ed from -5 to -4.5 with durant out. warriors are 29-25 against the spread  in the p assit three seasons at home following a su loss.

EliHershkovich,how so? beyond the mental hurdle of that duke loss plus running into minnesota's best shooting performance of the season mack sustained plenty to build off of. gotta consider development with nwora etc. as well.

Gingfacekillah,you certainly can. you'll find it doesn't change the coefficients very much in my experience. for weighting recent games there are a number of ways to do it i have one posted on my timeline.
Gingfacekillah,"should only be available through amazon with a download link in the cha point er titled ""download my models"". in the print edition you'll see the link as an endnote in the cha point er."
Gingfacekillah,here is the specific excel formula i used to make it work using the share of points [runs] rating tradeoff. if anyone is interested in exploring this i can make the spreadsheet available to download.
Gingfacekillah,"more fan mail.

""there is just no value in this book because it teaches you nothing that is ahead of the team of scientists working at pinnacle sports.""

thanks for  years old you are review!"
Gingfacekillah,nothing is identical to the srs although the prp model would be very similar if you look at the estimated spread. you could also calculate something analogous with the gssd model if you wanted to.
logan_matthews9,o you are entire backline structure has changed. cbs split way wider and the holding mid drops in. early on it worked more like a back 3 along with the rb tucking in we mentioned
logan_matthews9,oh i see the possibility. but i dont see much in the p assit to suggest a p5 school like that even against a really good fcs school should have a line under a  touchdown
logan_matthews9,a trade exce point ion cant be used to sign someone. maybe they could use it to then st for kemba but salaries would have to match so theyd still have to send someone out

adamchernoff,kc has played to a top ten secondary for the season against the most difficult schedule of opposing passers. they are one of the most difficult matchup units that any team in the playoff presents...
adamchernoff,"hence the nap part of the equation...

the thing that always intrigues me is that i feel like the way i think about and evaluate nfl teams/markets is applicable to horses. always tem point ing."
adamchernoff,reduce the chop reduce the wins. simple math. as soon as the word g overtime out that there was less chop anticipated this game sharp move to the cards and  it is  getting rewarded early.
adamchernoff,i am all for the jets take but fading a team during the season because they are missing a tight end and an opponent they only play twice is improving would be extremely short sighted.
adamchernoff,"it is a big weekend in #ligabancomermx  as league leaders  and  square off in monterrey.

adamchernoff,"favourite follow (4/8):

adamchernoff,appreciate that very much. my goal with the podc assit is just that keep it genuine and simple in hopes others learn the same. focus on what matters. thanks for taking the time to listen.
Ccon8181,i know its disappointing but remember im trying to show you how i makes a living at this. its a long game. and if youre on board youll see we grind out profits long term.

ToddFuhrman,sometimes  it is  easier to lose games this way where you never had a chance; go back and reassess to learn from it.  felt the same way with a fiu +3 ticket on thursday night...
ToddFuhrman,props to all the  fans out there; watching game 3 and 4 p assit few days the building sounds absolutely electric and it couldn't be better for the sport to have non-traditional markets going bonkers
TheCousinSal,id apologize for my jalen hurts sucks tweet but i think it was just the inspiration he needed to pull off an insane comeback in waco...so lets go ahead and just leave things as is.
TheCousinSal,my sources have confirmed that kawhi leonard is signing a deal with either the ra point ors lakers or the clippers extending anywhere between 1 and 5 years for $20 mm-$200 mm. eat it  !!
TheCousinSal,sure the  have failed to win since   i sang their praises - but the degenerate trifecta went 6-2 with their best bets on the very same #againstallodds podc assit this week. listen here to reminisce.

12Xpert,they might but they could be told where to go. currently the regulatory has the power to impose huge fines so i  daily fantasy sports  see why they couldn't have this imposed on them too.
12Xpert,well  it is  that 99.9 percent  figure  that is  open to debate. broadly speaking i agree with you but we  daily fantasy sports  actually know what it is and how it varies for different markets.
12Xpert,the smaller we make those samples the more likely it is that something will look inefficient. the bigger we make them the more likely it is we are simply stating an obvious but meaningless truism.
12Xpert,you  daily fantasy sports  need anything else to create social goods (invisible hand). complex systems (like society) have (bottom-up) mechanisms n overtime leaders (doing top-down designing). historical attem points  at the latter have proved disastrous.
12Xpert,on the contrary i think almost any judgement that involves prediction the future with money at stakes (sports betting and financial markets in particular) is only a coin flip for nearly everyone who does it.
12Xpert,actually for favourites 10 points magnitude it was enough in this sample. whether  it is  genuinely statistically significant and therefore persistent going into the future or simple a lucky set of data is another matter.
12Xpert,and frankly i think it says all these sports forecasting groups are utterly pointless and self serving (which is probably what taleb would say of nate) since a sharp betting market does a better job.

mschwimer,we answered all the will you get paid questions. look into what it means to file reg d with the sec. all my partners and i will be breaking the law by n overtime paying.
mschwimer,all of o you are subscribers can track.  has already said they will buy at le assit 1 package. do you n overtime trust them to track? cant imagine anyone wanting us to fail more.
mschwimer,if you really believe that then why wouldnt you sign up? give me 1 good reason why you wouldnt sign up. if you are right you get 10k. if you are wrong you lose 3k.
mschwimer,disappointed for responding? it is very clear you have n overtime done the research. watch the real vision interview. or read the bloomberg article. lots more media coming in the next couple days/weeks. stay tuned!
mschwimer,whoa. instantly received an e-mail from a subscriber that says pinny 100 percent  the best. he said pinny is better than cris because lines are tighter.  example. phils vs. marlins. pinny +217/-238. cris +216/-244. thoughts?
RufusPeabody,so what youre saying is  years old you are model is treating randomness as predictive signal. despite cross-validation regularization etc. in other words its way overfit. which is a huge issue with unsupervised ml.
RufusPeabody,obviously you need to have *some* arm strength to succeed. we can disqualify the danny wuerffels of the world but above a certain threshold arm strength is one of the less important attributes imo
RufusPeabody,"and that has nothing to do with whether i'm a ""better picker"" than other people. the only relevance my betting has is my perspective that betting my picks is better financially than selling them."
RufusPeabody,some insight into how we at  see the rest of the  college football  season playing out simulating remaining games plus conf champ games 20000 times and using o you are probabilistic committee selection model.
RufusPeabody,this is ridiculous. think about how many more correlated parlays theyve booked that didnt hit. guessing those customers never g overtime their money back.  reward for incompetence should n overtime be getting a freeroll.
RufusPeabody,there are a ton of sports betting related analytics companies raising a l overtime of money. i dont know what half of them do. half the companies dont even know what they do themselves!
RufusPeabody,this doesnt make sense. why is kelly lots of small losses? if youre betting huge longshots it is but if youre betting big favorites its lots of small wins and an occasional big loss.
RufusPeabody,my week monday woke up at 9:30am worked on golf till 3:30am (only breaks were for food and a quick workout). today: woke up at 9am been working on more us open stuff since.
RufusPeabody,the evidence is pretty overwhelming that betting using a tout will make a bettor lose more since you n overtime only lose the vig but you have to pay a fee for the pick.
RufusPeabody,my point is that i  daily fantasy sports  believe there are people out there with an expectation of worse than 47.6 percent  against a widely available two-way market with a 50 percent  no-vig probability.

do those opening lines induce balanced action? no. 

do those opening lines cause ""circa sportsbook"" to be mentioned in all forms of media around the country each week? definitely."
capjack2000,i support betting exchanges but bettors need to realize they would be swimming with sharks. im in favor of exchanges where bettors cant make markets for significant amounts. leave that to dedicated market makers.
capjack2000,"check out:
       the list could go on.

the $5000 threshold applies only to the other lottery products."
capjack2000,penn state is more of a national team like notre dame. i'm sure pa books were weighted on psu but i think almost all books were. besides all the pa books have multi-state exposure.
capjack2000,"in my latest blog i highlight the biggest mistake made by each state that has legalized sports wagering. 

this is part one...theres been a l overtime of states and a l overtime of mistakes."
capjack2000,daily fantasy sports  get too excited about sports betting in montana. it'll be lottery controlled and run for the first few years. that means no competition lack of innovation and probably a high-margin product.

robpizzola,there are rarely instances where  it is  worth it to buy points.  daily fantasy sports  get in the habit of doing it for peace of mind. it will cost you in the long run.
robpizzola,rodney harrison telling us that the key to disturbing jared goff is to apply pressure as if th against the spread n overtime the key to disturbing every quarterback in the history of football.
robpizzola,the pass before the sh overtime attem point  also has an impact on the xg itself. in some cases an extreme impact. goalie positioning would also be a factor but we arent there yet.
robpizzola,i have already wagered on the latter three. i'm torn on florida because i have been high on them relative to market for a bit now but i will likely end up betting it.
robpizzola,ive never enjoying rewatching a series as much as game of thrones. there are so many easter eggs and so much foreshadowing that i missed the first time around. the writing really is brilliant.
RASPicks,i agree with almost everything that rufus  and many others say about touts. i just wish they would n overtime always completely ignore the exce point ions to the general advice that they give.
RASPicks,"something like ""this line is off because of this this and this"" is what we'd be looking for.  records can be a piece of it too but hard to verify them in most cases."
VegasRefund,zion is about to take over the  college basketball  world.  daily fantasy sports  think we have seen a player in a long time garner as much attention as he potentially will get this year.

suuma810,"since the #seahawks dra free throw ed russell wilson in 2012 they have only lost three games by more than 10 points. out of 116.

they are +10 dogs against the #rams this week."
ClevTA,what i meant by n overtime awful team it also matters that the opposing offense doesnt constantly go 3 and out too: jax indy and det have bad os and barely had the ball
CizzlingSports,they will just say rufus already called them out and they  daily fantasy sports  do it anymore but will still include all the plays in the alleged long term record they tweet every day
CizzlingSports,i didn't attack brett - he randomly jumped into a convo on his own to defend randy and pregame and to promote his upcoming tout site. prob never would have known abt betkarma otherwise

spanky,once a game starts i think the bet should stand. however if an error is determined prior to the game starting then prior written rules on what constitutes a bad line should be consulted.
spanky,"a guy pulled a gun to get a sp overtime on line for stardust openers!

stardust was before my time and ive heard star touchdown ust opener stories but this one takes the cake."
spanky,if only every sportsbook produced something like this and honored them for all customers the industry would be better from it. kudos  for leading the way despite being the new kid on the block.
spanky,a really sharp friend who i highly respect recommended i bet enough so if i lost it would sting a little. he told me opportunities like this probably come 2-3 times in a lifetime....
spanky,players may stop patronizing these places and instead bet at a place where there is room for growth. everyone starts out square with a dream to be sharp. places like  and  stifle that dream.
DocBettor,the timeout counts and occasional top line are yellow too. talk about a confusing viewer experience -  of all broadc assits should know that yellow is a reserved color for penalty flags in football.
DocBettor,if you're a winning sports bettor aren't taxes one of the biggest reasons why offshore  bookies are still better than legal outs? or does everyone rummage for losing tickets in books/at tracks cc #gamblingtwitter

aluckyaday,forget playing the games just contract massey peabody to simulate the season. even teams with no chance will be able to say hey remember 2020 when we won the championship  once in 10000 simulations
aluckyaday,they are n overtime bookmakers they are marketing companies. their clients are n overtime pro gamblers. they are recreational clients. why do you think you know better then them how to run their business?

aluckyaday,maybe passing the poisoned brexit challis to johnson will turn out well for stewart when johnson fails to deliver the impossible he will be there to pick up the pieces. i told you so.....

EdMillerPoker,"weve already built the football product. any operator that believes me can basically start offering it to their customers tomorrow.

any who doesnt believe me i think tbh is gonna learn the hard way."
EdMillerPoker,well thank you. were trying to build out a specific piece of the picture. hoping if we are successful it will refocus the industry a little and people can build on top of it.
EdMillerPoker,so first  is n overtime intended as a betting tool. it is a line feed intended for sportsbook operators. as such i dont recommend you make bets based solely on a line we publish.
EdMillerPoker,the espn one i think iirc starts their games at whatever their proprietary pregame model prediction is which makes sense for an espn to do but renders the model basically useless for in-game betting.
EdMillerPoker,"to be clear my main argument is that current infrastructure (i.e. feed latency and quality as well as broadc assit latency) doesn't adequately support ""always up"" football markets dealt in a fair customer-friendly way."
EdMillerPoker,the so free throw ware is the most important part of all this stuff. n overtime having it is a pretty big fail but having it just barely functional is the long silent fail
EdMillerPoker,i ripped one of the 5 problems out of my 6.002 final crumpled it into a ball and threw it toward the front of the room and g overtime an a on the exam.

nonrandomalpha,"public pounding a bad team on the road vs i  daily fantasy sports  care who is unpalatable. i usually will avoid betting these types of games which is essentially gambling on ""who is worse?"""
LeeSharpeNFL,"nagy saying ""mitch has grown"" and then citing an example of the week 3 game vs. washington while just pretending the whole week 16 game vs. kansas city didn't happen is pretty yikes though."
LeeSharpeNFL,pit has the tiebreaker advantage over ten but.... if ten goes to 10-6 and pit goes to 9-7 then the tiebreakers  daily fantasy sports  matter so how does this game n overtime affect them?
LeeSharpeNFL,we  daily fantasy sports  have enough dra free throw  capital to pick a new qb. i assume trubisky is the starter for 2020 as much as i would prefer a trade of some kind.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah that part i get i guess it feels a little weird to n overtime ""punished"" for making easy throws... but you're n overtime punished in this for throwing those incomplete though either. hmm."
LeeSharpeNFL,"""in conclusion dad when you consider the roi of my time a c was actually the right grade for me to sho overtime for in this class. i appreciate  years old you are understanding."""
LeeSharpeNFL,when you have 3rd and 10 from the 16 with 0:45 le free throw  and 3 timeouts i'd probably try for a first over a  touchdown  immediately. i am n overtime the colts though.
whale_capper,thought the over was a good look on the opener but the more i break down the game the more i believe bal will try to play keep away and plays into an under
whale_capper,it is pretty consistent year over year to have preseason games land in the 30s... most due to game plan approach and replacement level talent on the field for huge portions of the game

JoeyKnish22,actually since you called it knish invitational im gonna go in and manually add a few points to  years old you are score so you should be even higher here in a few minutes.

hopefully he kills blough in the process and lions have to put in roary the masc overtime at qb."
JoeyKnish22,folks please direct  years old you are trolling here  when they get shut out. ive g overtime dinner plans anyway dont need to be reading akron sucks tweets from you idiots while im eating.
JoeyKnish22,add in the university and sports program already had a culture full of cover ups and lying. and the numerous former players who admitted use or were widely known to use. there ya go.
JoeyKnish22,im hearing charlie strong has interest may n overtime be going that well at usf but think hed be really perfect for rutgers. n overtime sure how a strong/sitkowski combo doesnt revive the program.
JoeyKnish22,its an albanian coffee shop. n overtime 100 percent  sure where they get the coffee from but it makes me feel like im gonna have a stroke so i continue to go (probably addicted).
JoeyKnish22,i would love it obviously lol but hes just n overtime putting up the numbers/production you need for an mvp season. would need a huge 2h and some other top contenders to falloff imo.
JoeyKnish22,like when that australian prime minister forg overtime to renew his own website and somebody else bought it on the cheap and used it to troll him. really top level trolling. props for originality.

TheKostos,funny he's my mvp of week 10. coached a terrible game and my team lost and my qb looked good and he's one step closer to out the door. far from a pos imo

LockyLockerson,we give him a ton of shit on the show but he is completely on fire in college basketball so far this season. really impressive because i know he puts insane time in handicapping.
LockyLockerson,full projections and analysis for the nba as well as college basketball for a busy wednesday now up at the patreon page.  thanks to everyone for their support! may the nba good fortune continue.
LockyLockerson,to me this is very similar to bucks-hornets l assit year when everyone bet milwaukee over before the season steamed them opening night and they won but did n overtime cover vs the close.
LockyLockerson,quick timeout to say 3 isnt nearly as valuable in the preseason so you should probably sell it if you can.  1 is a value that comes up much more than 3 because...preseason.  woo.
LockyLockerson,it is  always the best when you decide to write a book about an event for the first time and then a week out that event is put into jeopardy by a global pandemic.

DannyParkins,"we've reached the part of the broadc assit where al and cris are suggesting the bears try kickers ""out of the cry point "" or ""ted nugent."" smoke em if you g overtime em."
DannyParkins,because that no talent hack  is easy to miss th against the spread how. its n overtime like hes versatile smart hilarious or any other positive quality hes just a bully with a microphone.
DannyParkins,khalil mack is playing at a level where the discussion of him being a better player than aaron donald and thus the best defensive player in the nfl is n overtime at all ridiculous.
DannyParkins,well there's also the child with the broken arm. also the nfl suspended jimmy smith for making thre against the spread and being emotionally abusive. again you're totally comfortable saying he did nothing wrong?
DannyParkins,genuinely curious how much the players will credit the new format vs honoring kobe and mamba mentality as the reason for this legitimately high level of effort and defense in an all star game.
DannyParkins,pumped for the radio debut of  9-11 am ct with   we're airing on    and many more in addition to  search out the podc assit  it is  a nightly gambling show that focuses on entertainment.

chadmillman,we are bringing back the executive decision to the buffet podcast. have a quarrel or beef or dispute or dilemma that scooch and i need to judge send em. winner comes on to explain.
chadmillman,i see the chargers fourth quarter and overtime collapse as progress. instead of giving up a  touchdown  when it was tied they limited jags to  field goal ...and covered the 5.5-point spread. see progress.

Gingfacekillah,devin booker median vs avg and cumulative  percent  points scored. a free throw er a 59 point game you can expect the line to have some under value. notice average skewed above the median.
Gingfacekillah,epl friends: can anyone explain to me how added time works in these games? is there a basic rule or rationale for how much time can expected to be added to a given game?
Gingfacekillah,"wondering if you can take the line information as a prior and  years old you are model estimate as the ""new evidence"" or vice versa to arrive at a bayesian update of the probability."

ToddFuhrman,you should be very proud to still be in the pool using the same team as 90 percent  of  years old you are competition going to get you a l overtime closer to winning
ToddFuhrman,unfortunately theres n overtime a ton id recommend but there are a number of financial investing books out there that elaborate on a l overtime of the same principles required to invest in sports
ToddFuhrman,both games should be great gents but  daily fantasy sports  see betting angles worth taking in these two but everyone running to back the bruins at current price just doesn't make sense to me
ToddFuhrman,"even thought i wouldn't call myself a serious fan at this point in my life...

having grown up a yankee fan watching the red sox unveil a world series banner makes my stomach turn..."
ToddFuhrman,do you still choose to bet them despite this  feeling and what do you mean when you say to a certain extent? always curious to get an idea of how people see the space...

12Xpert,"some people see the earth is flat. fortunately we have science that is more rigorous than simply saying i can ""see"" it. still n overtime sure what bias it is you want to prove?"
12Xpert,real live tipsters are almost always full of shit usually they  daily fantasy sports  know it. i  daily fantasy sports  need to make kelly simulations. flat stakes is just fine for this purpose thanks.
12Xpert,i would agree with all of that. the puzzle for me now is why pinny  daily fantasy sports  operate a fully efficient tennis market. is it intentional or simply lack of data and knowledge?
12Xpert,and a good thing it could which probably prevented the other 3 bad things happening and is why countries like greece spain italy and france suffer. they have to devalue people rather than money.
12Xpert,but my point still stands. if others do as you you all cancel out. the question is really whether  it is  harder with in-play hence gives more opportunities for clever and/or hard working people.
12Xpert,for nish closing prices are on average about 3 percent  shorter than his advertised prices so currently in his case you will still be showing a 6 percent  roi before subscri point ion costs.
12Xpert,i charged a small fee for verification (about 100 for 3 months). the website made about 40k in 9 years which was far less than minimum wage given the hours i put into it.
12Xpert,i think  that is  a fair compromise. set up a profit at  and tip the draws in real time. a couple of thousand tips should be sufficient should take about a year i guess.
JambosPicks,"o you are 17-week package starts tomorrow! but how does it work?  laid it out in his  interview

JambosPicks,we apologize but if you are betting $30 per game then o you are service is n overtime for you. however you should absolutely sign up and get all the thursday picks for free!
mschwimer,thank you! yes i can confirm it was the only player i took to win the heisman. futures bets are o free throw en n overtime great mathematically but underlying work in  paid off!
mschwimer,"1.  when you produce the type of returns i have been able to produce you can charge outrageous fees. 
2.  again we raised money in nov for the gp at an extremely high valuation."
mschwimer,"while technically correct. i see the word tout as someone who lies and isnt financially accountable for the picks they give out. if they lose they say tough luck

we are the polar opposite."
mschwimer,yes that certainly is!  its 3k per package.  so 50k specifically does n overtime work.  48k or 51k will work!  lets do it!  i will follow you and we can talk on direct message.
mschwimer,id like to go on record to say o you are model hates that play. but good luck anyways! i have no skin in the game either way so ill ro overtime for you.
mschwimer,my bold nba dra free throw  prediction.  adreian payne will end up being the steal of this dra free throw .  he will win roy next year and be a force in the nba
mschwimer,y are people saying this is a great dra free throw  for the 76ers? they lost 23 year old point guard who will be a top 5 pg in the league for 7 years.
RufusPeabody,new  is up! discussion of buying points machine learning (what the hell is it anyway?)  college football  playoff plus we agree on lots of picks this week. and  teaches me about intelligent automation.
RufusPeabody,it is  called betting. with sportsbooks. i bet my own money i do n overtime take other people's money. i  daily fantasy sports  sell anyone anything. and i'm very happy where i'm at.
RufusPeabody,i gave out maryland -7 on  line closed -5.5. is that stronger evidence that we have only 8 listeners or that we have a l overtime of listeners out there fading me? cc
RufusPeabody,i discussed it on my pod. no jabs were taken. i have fundamental issues with the business model which i've told michael since l assit fall. has nothing to do with my brand
RufusPeabody,taking reasonable limits from everyone. no one-way markets (if youre offering yes offer no price as well). and n overtime grading/settling some peoples wagers much more quickly than others in contests you run
RufusPeabody,this was fixed but is a great reminder to always check that  years old you are bets placed online or on an app are graded correctly. its tedious af but mistakes do happen.
RufusPeabody,dra free throw  strategy all depends on how you subdivide the foods. but we need a standard food list  the ff equivalent of standard league. who wants to help me put this together?
RufusPeabody,"q: how big of an impediment to us sports betting is the black market?

SportsCheetah,starting a new band thanks to matts tweet if anybody is interested. weve g overtime  on guitar and im manning the drums. were taking bass and vocal demos and videos in the meantime.
SportsCheetah,for context today i had 0.7 percent  on scherzer/n against the spread before scratch 2.75 percent  on the eagles 1 percent  mavs and some 2h stuff in the nba. it should vary some.
SportsCheetah,tulsa is -3 turnovers in the 1st half on the road against a ranked smu team that is 5-0 su and against the spread  this season  and the golden hurricane are up 14.

so i've decided to get the ball rolling by petitioning the nj dge. 

 let us  see how this goes..."
capjack2000,"this was a very good article on how geocomply works in legalized states. especially eye-opening was this paragraph. no wonder so many sportsbooks deem me an unprofitable customer. i'm constantly logging in/out:

capjack2000,again the most telling stat about the betmgm mobile betting product is that mgm does more revenue at their one brick  mortar location in nj than on their app...and apps rule the state.
capjack2000,lines by lvdc (ie: south point). it'll be an interesting dynamic. chinook winds is known to sweat small money and the boys from lvdc do not. we'll see how this culture plays out.
capjack2000,for the month of july i tracked every pick published by vsin ( here's a thread on how they performed - with a google sheet link at the end showing all the picks.
capjack2000,that is  disappointing.  it is  clear they cultivated various panels from those with a social media presence. wouldn't have been too hard to find some reputable voices of bettors in the garden state.
capjack2000,thanks krack. here's a link to a two-part tweet from 3 weeks ago with a quick rundown. the only thing that has changed afaik is betstarsnj is now $500 refund on first wager.

robpizzola,when  and the pizza man put their heads together on a stone cold nfl lock you best believe that we are going to cash (a game that we definitely didnt deserve to win).
robpizzola,i guess ben chiar overtime could be underrated in the sense that everyone considers him to be a replacement-level player and he might turn out to be marginally better than a replacement-level player.
robpizzola,"doug pederson gets it.

went for fourth-and-one at his own 39-yard-line earlier.

goes for two to make it a two-score game.

as far as in-game decisions are concerned hes one of the best."
robpizzola,if only this squad could have had ronaldo when they had the pirlo marchisio vidal pogba midfield diamond. now they are stacked with attacking thre against the spread and nothing to support them.
VegasRefund,"football season is upon us.

if you plan on getting  years old you are refundszn on this year.. show some support and rep the brand.

because im still here.. and im still free."
VegasRefund,find out the bc game gets cancelled while im standing in line at a gas station.. so i decide to throw a dart at a scratch ticket. law of averages  free throw w.
VegasRefund,scott hanson is continually telling them to switch games due to the looks of the eifert injury.. but they just continue to show him laying on the ground while his ankle is sideways.
ProfessorShine,i still hold on to the belief that its possible to be moderately entertaining without giving out shitty info.  it isnt that schwartz or rovell are clueless; its that theyre so arrogantly clueless.

spanky,it was a no lose situation taking the +233.  i either make 7k or if they woulda caught fire and obtained a loyal following moving markets i woulda been on the ground floor.
spanky,"if you're gonna bet in-play be cognizant of 
1.) the bookmaker's approval delay.
2.) how wide the line margins are.
3.) how delayed the feed is (why i only recommend betting during stoppage/commercials)."
spanky,the betting partner and us share in profits and losses.   however depending on the type of outs and quantity we instead offer small free rolls for betting partners who arent as financially strong..
spanky,and if they support their operators decision to book 10 bucks max on an nfl game then they are soooooooooooooooooooo out of touch with the us market that they need to simply leave....
spanky,i hear ya ed but i think there may be something unquantifiable or at le assit difficult to quantify in the playoffs for most sports.  its certainly a different animal than regular season...
spanky,i dont know what proper is but in my world when a bookmaker tells me what their limits are its always the base amount (which is the lower amount of risk and win).
spanky,if this is the case then selling should be meaningless and you should instead look for more outs to get down than try and take 30 bucks from someone who really needs it...
PlusEVAnalytics,even with an exchange you either have to pay a bid/ask spread a second time to exit  years old you are trade or you have to keep one side and ride the variance.
PlusEVAnalytics,or what about this. cash-settled derivatives on the closing line. instead of betting the chiefs -160 for $1000 you take a long position on 100k nominal dollars with a strike price of -160.
PlusEVAnalytics,it gets better - the end zone at bmo field is 3 yards shorter than regulation because th against the spread all they could fit into a stadium that was built for soccer
PlusEVAnalytics,again its semantics whether you get there by reducing  years old you are theoretical edge or by betting fractional kelly. same result. what matters is how you figure out what fraction to use.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah th against the spread even more screwed up. but what youre saying is that we shouldnt jump on the g4 line because its more a case of the g3 line being wrong?
PlusEVAnalytics,would be a decent idea for the book that offered the original bet to use it as collateral to borrow money for the hedge. its n overtime a good idea done this way.
PlusEVAnalytics,if the market return is -4.5 percent  and you need to be 99.9 percentile skilled to find positive alpha cash under  years old you are mattress works better as an uncorrelated asset class.
PlusEVAnalytics,a sad reality of the business world is that its so complex that its easy to confuse the facade of intelligence with real intelligence. this is why people use leverage as a verb.
aluckyaday,if you are feeling flush and want to check  years old you are draw theory on more data  personally i do think draws get overlooked and inefficiencies could l assit a long time!
aluckyaday,favorite longsh overtime bias . i would have thought the best chance of it working will be for outliers at the front of the market which are more likely to be loss leaders.
aluckyaday,overfitting is the scourge of trying to predict a close to random event.  moneyline will find good correlations that is what it is designed to do. but correlation does n overtime equal cause.
aluckyaday,they are n overtime vegas bookmakers. they are online recreational bookmakers. their target market is very very different. its a completely different business. you seem to be struggling with this conce point .
aluckyaday,the response referring to rates of food poisoning rates was no better comparing two completely different statistics. but it is typical of the brexit debate from both sides. lies damn lies and statistics!
aluckyaday,why do order based systems work so well in financial markets but n overtime betting ones. i guess its because financial markets primary purpose is n overtime to enable traders to get rich.
aluckyaday,"that was the point i was trying to make. is it really the correct strategy for someone trying to make a living from betting which i assume ""professional"" bettors are trying to do."
aluckyaday,if g is feeling good ineos ride the tourmalet hard. once dqs are down to 2  send bernal on the attack? mas would have to follow isolating alaphilippe. or is that too risky?
aluckyaday,well the ridiculous year continues. luckies running at 88.62 percent  roi p-value of 1.33 percent . singles 22.62 percent  p-value 0.36 percent . i wonder if i could do this in australia  ?
aluckyaday,flaws in  years old you are strategy aside making money from so free throw  books is pretty easy to be honest. but backing value prices in singles will result in accounts being restricted.
theFirmAISports,a free throw er 6 years of losing do you close up shop or listen to all  years old you are friends and find another industry to sell  years old you are nonsense?
joeytunes2,were losing market fast. now with  closing nj. from what i hear theres other states too. also hearing rumors of betgrande closing as well. (always a rumor). donbest is quickly becoming less valuable.
joeyisaks,1 im n overtime 1-4 on things ive given out 2 i shoudla given out taht i played it back at u158 when it moved 3 no one is on joeytunes level obviously
EdMillerPoker,n overtime quite right to say i learned this the hard way but kinda. never the right idea to look at something see the fatal long term flaw and just start fading it.
EdMillerPoker,yeah im on an island with him basically everyone likes him so im prob wrong. but im prob gonna have to pass on him the guy rubs me the wrong way ridiculously hard.
EdMillerPoker,"just laugh every time i see ppl tout stuff like ""bet on whether the next pitch will be a ball or strike"" as the *next big thing*. lolno for like 6 different reasons."
EdMillerPoker,lrt: still n overtime quite sure why traditional publishers aren't half-dead by now. i mean why deal with the bullshit just write  years old you are book and put it on amazon already.
EdMillerPoker,look at the dk and fd ux. think who does this ux appeal to? and who would be turned off by this ux? target the second group and build the ux they want.
GolcondaFund,i am ske point ical of people who hate on cowherd. yes he is a media figure but the guy works hard to form arguments most would never think of. i dig it.
GolcondaFund,"remember when bears twitter fans said bears 34-14 pack...

the tall tail sign to go the exact opposite direction.

or trubisky. or gb improved defense. or nagy getting cute with play calling.

#sharp"
nonrandomalpha,+30000 implies a 0.33 percent  probability. th against the spread grossly expensive for dolphins to win the division. id handicap it closer to 0.01 to 0.00 percent  which means im paying up monstrously.
nonrandomalpha,speaks to his broader judgment (or lack thereof) and delusional sense of self - both of which are unattractive and destructive qualities for a qb to have off but especially on the field.
LeeSharpeNFL,"someone who understand coaching/team dynamics better than me:

how much does the offensive coordinator being fired matter on a team like the bears where the head coach is an offensive minded play caller?"
LeeSharpeNFL,it is  becoming more popular. when i interview job applicants i never even read the education section of their resume unless i'm checking to see if it explains a long work history gap.
LeeSharpeNFL,if sea wins they'd face no which my model indicates is the worst o point ion for sea when compared to sf or gb so  that is  a good argument for resting starters.
LeeSharpeNFL,the file was corru point ed it looked like which would make sense as to why it didn't attach to the tweet i guess. dunno why it g overtime corru point ed though!
LeeSharpeNFL,a reminder that the nfl cowardly moved cle/pit from the late window to the early window because just to reduce the o point ics of what happened on the pit/cle monday night game.
LeeSharpeNFL,8 games feels so much easier to follow at once than 9 games. i  daily fantasy sports  know why  that is  my line but it feels like  it is  the line for me.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the game that i work on for my job uses ""cmc"" as a common abbreviation and i have to do a double take every time i see it used to mean christian mccaffrey."
LeeSharpeNFL,"someone tell me because i'm never experienced this:

what is it like to have  years old you are qb throw the ball like 40 yards down field and be excited instead of panicing?"
LeeSharpeNFL,passes like that bears touchdown allow pace and nagy to delude themselves into thinking they can salvage something out of trubisky. i wish they'd quit happening so my team could actually get better.
LeeSharpeNFL,"that would be ideal but tell that to the tv announcers who keep talking about ""which team has the momentum"" as though  it is  predictive for what is likely to happen moving forward."
LeeSharpeNFL,"totally fine to prefer python to r or r to python.

but demanding (n overtime even asking nicely) for people voluntarily posting their own code to do work for you is pretty crappy."
whale_capper,would you say the fact that b2b roadies have no signal against the spread  vs closing numbers just means the market accounts for it correctly... wouldnt be surprising since its widely talked about
whale_capper,pace was very high and unlikely to maintain on track for 106.1 possessions would expect that to come down to like 99 by the end of the game esp if  it is  tight
AndyMSFW,it reminds me of people with the twins/yanks under 9.5 l assit night.  nothing like a two ho you are tease to rip  years old you are heart out on something meaningless late...
AndyMSFW,it is  n overtime for a very big audience but now i'm seriously picturing a sunday where i send the kids to the amusement park and i bet football all day next door.
AndyMSFW,i think a ton of baseball cappers will continue to incorporate wrc+ into their process and  that is  fine.  i like to stay ahead of the curve and will only be using wrc++
AndyMSFW,i  daily fantasy sports  know jack shit about the big conferences so here's  years old you are resource for that when the dance rolls around next week.  real comprehensive guide for only $10.
JoeyKnish22,for what  it is  worth . these are bets i made n overtime my line opinion lol. i can see how that could have been confusing a free throw er my recent tweets.
JoeyKnish22,of the remaining bowl games this is my favorite play le free throw  on the board. wku -2.5/-3 good sized play for me. strong agree with the cap here. think the tops roll.
JoeyKnish22,lmao 1/4th of the pool is. there was 2 very stale totals so it didnt really take a genius to bet the totals unless you were trying to be contrarian first strategy sake.
JoeyKnish22,exactly. ill have a line of ppl out my front door stop by and hit one max bet for me and i give you a christmas ham to take home to the family.
JoeyKnish22,also  too. n overtime sure if you noticed that probably overlooked it. hes one of my favorites. n overtime sure how that good looking son of a bitch can be so sharp too.
JoeyKnish22,i listen to a l overtime too usually a dozen or so. i probably tried too big of a jump will try out 1.1. i think i tried 1.5 and absolutely hated it.
JoeyKnish22,"the steelers ended phil rivers career on national tv l assit night. 

tonight the lions bury a washed up aaron rodgers for good in front of all his pathetic inbred cheesehead fans. #onepride"
JoeyKnish22,"its been too long. its been far too long. how ive missed you so. but its a slow night and its time for a wednesday night mls degen special. #goatleague. 

timbers  moneyline (-105)"
JoeyKnish22,he used some of the dumbest lineup combinations and tactics ive ever seen. it literally just took a guy setting up the team with the players in normal positions to turn it around.
JoeyKnish22,never seen it with miazga. n overtime at the international level n overtime at the club level.  pretty sure his entire reputation is chelsea randomly bought him to loan out 3 years ago.
TheKostos,that tripping call.. i mean. how do you call that? what is the explanation for it? what does the nfl say to made up ridiculous calls that affect games and the point spread?
TheKostos,"on sunday:

giants fans should be rooting for the jets and jets fans should be rooting for the giants. any fan of either team that is rooting for their own team is nuts."
TheKostos,yes  that is  fine. good read on the game! i am just n overtime into tweeting people while their bets are losing or are gonna lose to remind them their bet is losing!
LockyLockerson,n overtime with how the committee shat on them a free throw er the baylor game.  alabama beating auburn is better than anything ou has le free throw  to do and they're behind.
LockyLockerson,haven't run it or anything also every case probably different but when i was updating my schedule spreadsheets for each team thought it was interesting.  can check backwards at some point this week.
LockyLockerson,texas state for a little bit tonight at +3 that might be it.  i keep waiting for the piv overtime from syracuse but it may never happen. that game's borderline unwatchable to me.
LockyLockerson,sf-cin: another game  that is  moved completely to my number.  friday's show i made a strong case for sf at +2 i made the game sf -0.5.  now  it is  sf -1.  welp.
LockyLockerson,does the nfl or a third party site provide long videos of just the plays from these games chopped up on one long timeline? f assit forwarding thru these game replays is absurd.
LockyLockerson,man my grammar here was atrocious.  but you get the idea.  7p et tonight we do the best we can with what we've got.   let us  go through march madness in 2 hours.
LockyLockerson,it would be interesting if one of the narratives that sprung from the next 2-3 months is fans getting the message that they dont matter nearly as much as they think they do
EliHershkovich,"for sure but they're n overtime ""elite"" defensively. beyond this one their only other road game was at unc against a team that can't sho overtime and anthony who's struggled to finish inside."
EliHershkovich,"always a bl assit co-hosting with  o you are college football bets  a breakdown of the entire nfl card.

DannyParkins,heres the story with the quotes and the link to the podc assit of o you are conversation with eddie jackson about his opinion bears fans booing the team was unacce point able
DannyParkins,if you missed o you are conversation with theo you need to seek it out. i've never quite heard him like that. we'll replay it at 5:00 and talk through it all now.
DannyParkins,lack of de point h. lack of playing time together. youth. we dont know what free agents are gonna go east. still lots of reasons bulls are an underdog to make the playoffs.
DannyParkins,just landed 8 tickets to sale v lopez tomorrow and 8 more to saturdays sox/red sox game which i believe is star wars night. ill leave them around the city tomorrow morning. #whitesox
DannyParkins,the nfl dra free throw  is a remarkable piece of propaganda. seemingly every pick is draped in nostalgia charity patriotism or some other hey look at how good and pure we are messaging.
DannyParkins,fantastic reporting by  on the relationship between mike mccarthy and aaron rodgers and how theres plenty of blame to go around for there n overtime being more winning in green bay. must read.
DannyParkins,fun start to the sox game with one great and one bad play by anderson eloys debut albeit with 2 ks on offspeed stuff and man watching mondesi run is pretty damn special.
chadmillman,the first fo you are minutes of this  podcast with  and  is as good as anything there is about dealing with losing whether you bet or not. fourth worst saturday of my life.
chadmillman,"""there has never been a winless team whose coach has just been fired that has gone on the road and been favored by more than a field goal."" and yet here we are..."
chadmillman,so much nba playoff talk with but his insta-take on dominique wilkins as a defensive liability worth a couple of points against the spread  in legends lineup of nba2k is where he shines.
chadmillman,it is incredibly exciting for  that someone of  skill  talent joins o you are team. hes going to provide a pov on nba with pieces podc assits  video that enhances everything we do.
Gingfacekillah,showing an edge on uta at -8 slight lean on the under but bky's 3pm variance and tight 1h/1q line suggest it may be less likely. time to fire and watch the market.
Gingfacekillah,agree q the obviously better choice. hitch was more likely the best available that would a) come to edm given their dumpster fire and b) be willing to take a 1/2 year deal.
logan_matthews9,"that could be?  i do n overtime know  ive seen a handful of his tweets and its both awful (how bad he is) and sad.

took a pretty big position on this one...

 market outlook and handicap
 key injuries will be tested
green light to bet on the total

adamchernoff,"strange. all of the titans fans from this p assit week must be at holiday parties with their families and have their phones turned off out of respect. 

they missed a good game..."
adamchernoff,i  daily fantasy sports  know the origin story of why it ended up there but do you know if they had an o point ion to build new or put it else where?
adamchernoff,well im the le assit intelligent person on that list by a mile - but thanks for the nod. those guys can play the tips and ill keep swinging away from the whites.
adamchernoff,yep certainly n overtime a winning formula. have to dive into a few things to confirm they sat in zone with the lead but it certainly appears that way based on the numbers.
adamchernoff,no idea what the answer is but i think to best fit the sport it has to be a challenge like situation where the match only stops if requested. losses cost a substitution?
adamchernoff,expressvpn at the moment. i am n overtime doing any free stream garbage. i just want to pay for decent subscri point ions each month and have a reliable service that looks good.

Ccon8181,bout to get cracked a free throw er #wisconsin goes prevent offense up 11 with 10 minutes le free throw  in bonus and best player decides cant sho overtime a  free throw .
kellyinvegas,ill get it from  but since the pat was moved back th against the spread just the truth. small sample or n overtime th against the spread how the game is currently played.
kellyinvegas,but on the road is a different story. im n overtime betting the lions. just n overtime rushing to back the cowboys in another road situation where they should easily win/cover but dont.
ToddFuhrman,no doubt much different for a pro that fires higher volume with limits restrictions and can quantify his edge precisely where volume can neutralize some of the variance in a smaller sample size
ToddFuhrman,"didnt take long for the  to offer a brutal beat...

villa leads 1-0 p assit the 70  minutes mark only to concede 3x the final 17 minutes and blow the cover at +1.5"
ToddFuhrman,still doesn't pass a sniff test...you can question james harden's defense (terrible analogy here across sports) but you're n overtime sitting him on the bench for the biggest stage because of defensive shortcomings

TheCousinSal,pat schurm you are is yet another to fall victim to belichicks spell.  punting on 4th and 2 down 14 with 7 minutes le free throw  is playing to cover...n overtime to win.
TheCousinSal,im n overtime exactly sure how my  over 3.5 goals bet is going to lose. they need to change the rules so that hitting the post over 5 times counts as a score.
TheCousinSal,why are we conditioned to get excited when we see people in the in memoriam who have moved us one way or another?  wouldnt it be better if we didnt recognize anyone? #academyawards19
TheCousinSal,on an all new against all odds the degenerate trifecta  i break down conf. finals shar point ank best bets + i talk predictions pantyhose ads over/under sex partners with  legend joe namath(42:33)
TheCousinSal,win or lose - this is disgraceful clock management exhibited by anthony lynn. the  should have the ball with 1:40 le free throw .  n overtime :31. use  years old you are timeouts!!!
12Xpert,bookmakers typically get nervous about posting early odds for teams like this. hence when i come to post the odds at my usual times there have been no available odds for their matches.
12Xpert,looks like he bets in bigger football leagues so we should expect those to be more efficient. in which case with a large number of subscribers he should be moving lines if skilled.
12Xpert,probably where the edges lie before they are explored away and replaced with others. its n overtime about forecasting the future accurately its about doing it better than  years old you are opponent.
12Xpert,brilliant. destroy a billion pound industry that supports 85000 jobs because you have a moral objection to gambling at le assit you've finally been honest about  years old you are view of it.
12Xpert,i know you  daily fantasy sports  care about any of this. for you  it is  n overtime real world just academic statto talk. so  let us  n overtime waste each other's time anymore.
12Xpert,"unfortunately the words ""survivorship bias"" appear nowhere in this article. until you learn what this is and take it into account this is my advice:  daily fantasy sports  ever pay anyone for tips."
12Xpert,"when i use the word ""efficiency"" in a  betting context  describes perfectly what i (think i) mean. drill down into his thread and the posts that prom point ed it for more context."
12Xpert,"and as for brexit people would do well to remember the complexity of these systems before ado point ing absolutists positions with words like ""denier"" over matters that are fundamentally probabilistic in nature."
12Xpert,rank probability scores used for measurement of how good  years old you are model forecasting is lower scores better. presumably green arrows better red arrows worse as a relative measure across the models.
12Xpert,closing 1x2 is already there for pinny. opening is more of a challenge for me but if you need them for analysis purposes  have large historical opening odds data sets free of charge.
12Xpert,that will depend on what the market is. for large markets i would expect them to be very similar but i  daily fantasy sports  have the data to allow me to test this.
12Xpert,in effect he identifying the same profitably contrarian positions that pinny identifies. if pinny offered him a job as a trader that would certainly then shi free throw  my prior belief in clvh
12Xpert,the fact that a l overtime of people lose more than the vig does n overtime imply that others fading them will win enough to cover it. i think that is rufus' point.
12Xpert,whatever it is i have no idea of stake sizes hence no idea of yield no idea of odds. indeed i have no idea whether  it is  even anything to do with betting.
12Xpert,"i think you are confusing ""pro gamblers"" with ""pinnacle bettors"". there will be very little overlap. almost no bettors are pros.  and almost none of them are profitable through skill. take a look."

mschwimer,i can tell you. martin has 0 stake in anything related to jambos. just a pro bettor that subscribes to the service. i did n overtime know him at all prior to jambos.
mschwimer,the money has been raised. check the sec filings. they are public. we raised $23m for jambos specifically. if we lose we lose. but we will 100 percent  have the money to fund.
mschwimer,for those n overtime watching snell has 10 punchies in 4 innings. 20 is definitely in play if we were in the old school era and didnt care as much about pitch counts.

RufusPeabody,n overtime every total 37-41. he said 47 and 41. would have to look at my chart. buying onto or off the 48 for 10c decreases  years old you are ev. period.
RufusPeabody,there's a reason simplebet has pivoted from their original business model of pricing outcomes with ml. and  it is  n overtime because of a shortage of machine learning people in their employ.
RufusPeabody,it really hinges on how much value the committee puts on winning a p5 conference. and  that is  seemed to vary from year to year. different members on the committee and all.
RufusPeabody,unfortunately we could n overtime resolve o you are differences. i did n overtime believe that michael shared the same concerns i did related to his business from an ethical perspective. (5/x)
RufusPeabody,that was one of those challenges where i had no idea if we'd get an overturn. might have been a different story if they had the full array of camera angles available.
RufusPeabody,stuff i posted based off of it on thursday/friday hasn't done well the l assit few years. stuff i bet based off of it on monday/tuesday has had plenty of value though.
RufusPeabody,30/1 a free throw er r1 8/1 a free throw er r2 laid -165 a free throw er r3. but groups top 5/10/20s round bets and rotation were all solid this week.
RufusPeabody,i did n overtime see every play. i signed up for  years old you are site back in march. that does n overtime mean i was monitoring  years old you are plays.

SportsCheetah,sorry hopefully you g overtime some of the heat one earlier. was just trying to take advantage of the final 2  minutes sans lbj and the lakers scored 11 and crushed me.
SportsCheetah,and  for what  it is  worth  hes 20 and barely grades negatively defensively anyway. hes basically a league-average defender and to this point in the season the leagues most impactful offensive player.
SportsCheetah,the steph injury is unfortunate for many reasons but the one nobody is talking about is the fact that klay thompson had gone from joe harris to league mvp in 3.5 games.

dinkinc,here is my theory.  many decisions are close calls. identify them as such pick a road and put an effort into making it work.  dont try to be perfect.  you cant be
dinkinc,it amazes me that people won't vote for bernie because there are too many problems in o you are country and he wants to fix them all... isn't that the point ??
dinkinc,the two le assit likely teams to win the nhl west play in los angeles .. the most likely plays in las vegas... who would have seen that coming five years ago?/
dinkinc,hard to ask for new donations to dinkfund a free throw er this disaster of a month but the longterm members can vouch for my track record...  also the  horses need you
dinkinc,it is my business when you mentally abuse my friend..... waste of time to block somebody who doesn't follow you in the first place but i will take that as a compliment...
dinkinc,gambling is about value and n overtime blindly picking winners.  you must compare a horses chances to his odds. you can have a plan but you cant know who you are betting..
dinkinc,the only thing i can think of was he reared some and the starter did the right thing to grab him. n overtime even sure that would make him a starter anyway
robpizzola,seems like you can easily do that by using the clock. use video to find point of contact with the ground... use the sp overtime of the ball at that exact time.
robpizzola,n overtime sure how i feel about  being on this list. a good week for  or  runs you six figures in damage. a good week for knish runs you $600 in damage.
robpizzola,i had no idea that mahomes was going to be good. i just know that there have been tons of studies showing that trading up in the dra free throw  is -ev.
robpizzola,if you wagered on gary woodland to win the #usopen send me a pic of  years old you are bet slip and ill happily tell you that you should have wagered more.
robpizzola,im a huge breaking bad fan. definitely one of the best tv shows of all-time. well see how the final season of g overtime goes but for me thrones is the goat.
RASPicks,agree in almost all cases but if a service is super successful and becomes a considerable asset there are plenty of reasons why it would make sense to sell in some capacity.
RASPicks,you still run into the same problem even if someone publicly posts multiple successful seasons with lots of plays. are records real? were lines wa? weighted or unweighted? reasonably mature market? etc.
RASPicks,we are expecting to release at le assit one higher rated  college football  total today.  ras 1.5 and 2.0 unit plays are rare but 11-2 (84.6 percent ) l assit 5 years.
VegasRefund,even though i havent checked my comments im well aware that the haters are at an all time high which is fine.. just a few more flys on the wall then normal.
VegasRefund,"if antonio brown falls to you in the 2nd round of  years old you are fantasy dra free throw ...

for those nitpickers lets just say you have a mid round pick."
VegasRefund,"maction is forecasted to have 25-30  miles per ho you are winds tonight.

the total opened at 57 and has imploded down to 44.5.

spread has also dropped from 21.5 to 17."
VegasRefund,before posting futures.. lines can vary drastically across the market so shopping for the best line can be very advantageous (if you can). betonline seems to be one with some nice value.
ProfessorShine,if rovell didnt work for tan he wouldnt get so much grief.  its hypocritical to do engagement pieces then say sign up for action network and well make you a smarter bettor.
suuma810,"let us  go! the indianapolis #colts team preview is ready for consum point ion! i expect a stable offense but some regression on the defensive side of the ball.

check it out"
suuma810,"updated pinnacle #nfl season win totals  the implied strength of schedule. kc number is still off so i applied a consensus 10 from other books.

#texans now with the hardest projected schedule."
suuma810,they had a top-10 or top-5 pass rush l assit year with houston ford and jones. they could have ke point  both edge guys  use their 1st rounder to upgrade their secondary.
suuma810,yep was almost over at 6-2. panthers were one of the biggest candidates for negative seasonal regression so i expected a decline in the second half. but that 0-8 was really crazy.
suuma810,"the #vikings are trying to establish the run against a good front and are shocked it doesn't work out.

first down runs in 1st halves since week 16:

9 runs 13 yards."
suuma810,he ranked top-5 in pressure rate. actually had the same rate as joe thomas according to pff. sf g overtime rid of him because he isnt suited for shannys zone blocking scheme.
ClevTA,dorsey had unlimited cap space and dra free throw  picks. a monkey could spend all of those resources and go 6-10. he has made an insane amount of mistakes outside of hc
ClevTA,the guy has some of the worst hands ive ever seen and it dates back to college but athletically is a beast. definitely worth a flier to compete for a starting position
ClevTA,n overtime a disrespect thing just an observation. i dont watch a l overtime but maybe the steelers +3 and bills +2.5 as gi free throw s against the browns stand out.
ClevTA,a fun drinking gm would be every time freddie puts baker in em point y formation or blocks watt with a te u do a shot. u might be dead by half
ClevTA,but i was relentlessly mocked a few weeks ago about my longsh overtime 80-1 mvp. vikes keep winning and u never know? like a 3 percent  sh overtime is all i need
ClevTA,easily. all he had to do was dump it a few times to get ppl off his trail. n overtime be a hero every time but i guess that was the point
ClevTA,guess u look at it like if they score at the end of the game and decided to go for 2 and the win instead of the pat. essentially the same outcome
ClevTA,i can smell a bears pick from u a mile away. either way the real value is on over 1.5  touchdown s by rodgers. th against the spread  prop of the night
ClevTA,terrible idea. u will see teams on the cusp of a wildcard lose on purpose to get the 1st pk which is way worse than bad teams tanking.just leave it as is
CizzlingSports,the better q is why r u promoting a meaningless low limit opener at a single book that will move immediately on even the smallest of action (unless affiliate fees are involved)
CizzlingSports,"it is  n overtime in any way abt content. he regularly thumps his chest about his w/l record in the stale-line soopercontest.

spanky,the investment is supposed to equal the amount one can potentially lose given an 0-for wipeout.  you are reinvesting the money daily but are n overtime accounting for the previous days losses...
spanky,exactly.  the guys tweeting all the time about their records and how you should buy their service are scam artists. they make their living taking money from fellow bettors n overtime bookmakers.
spanky,they should instead write a b overtime api and an auto mover.... th against the spread the problem with these dressmakers. they implement strategies to deter betting instead of encourage betting... #beabookmakernotadressmaker
spanky,an auto-linemover is what drives both businesses.  the ship is on cruise control but theres a lines manager there to adjust accordingly.... im shocked that very few others have developed this technology.
spanky,every place in nj has kicked me out exce point    its been several months and my limits havent changed.  kudos to them and the paddy power boys across the pond.  much respect
spanky,daily fantasy sports  sell yourself short.  i've been in this racket long enough to realize you know  years old you are sh*t.  i'll be in town next week.  hope to say hi.
spanky,yeah but when betcris comes out with their numbers the wynn takes everything down in a panic..  offshore runs the us sports markets. vegas has played second fiddle for over a decade

DocBettor,good stuff. have you tracked the season-long record on the gerrit cole strikeout prop? i have no insight but based on his game log ill guess 16-9 a free throw er today
DocBettor,good  podcast as always! i dont think theres anything wrong with sites getting paid for impressions and clicks. pay per signup is a little worse percentage of losses is blatantly the worst.

EdMillerPoker,"pet peeve when media put a source's opinion/pr quote in headline/tweet above an article

super confusing and makes it sound like the source's (o free throw en total bs) opinion is fact"
EdMillerPoker,attacking others in the gambling space tends to be a very cheap tactic because mounting any sort of defense almost always forces you to divulge information they can use competitively against you
EdMillerPoker,like is the harm to you that you would have run 888 lineups but didn't bc you were worried about how unwieldy it would be to manage them within the web interface?
EdMillerPoker,i might add every time you bet a 50/1 sh overtime at a book theyre betting a 1/50 sh overtime against you and theyre pretty happy with that action all day long
EdMillerPoker,for example a prominent in-game odds provider in the l assit few  minutes made a ball at the wrong yardline error that you could sp overtime via the methods in the book.
EdMillerPoker,if you dont trip betting thresholds obv you wont see a problem. delays and rejections destroy the product tho even if the customer cant put their finger on that being the problem.
EdMillerPoker,in general the right idea is never to play a parlay with so many legs that youd want to hedge the final leg. break it up into smaller parlays and round-robins instead.
EdMillerPoker,consensus (and also what i've heard here and there offline from ppl) is that the main point of these job listings is to discourage most applicants. lol and mission accomplished i think.
GolcondaFund,i gotta give credit to  all off-season he had 49ers at 13-3 on the season. i started at 7 g overtime to 10 by end of pre-season. looking very sharp so far.
nonrandomalpha,i respect  for n overtime deleting this thread! ...and it seems he didn't actually take the broncos; the +3 as opposed to +3.5 ke point  him from getting his face ripped off.
nonrandomalpha,granted the division is worse than expected but even with that aggravating factor i'm still comfortable with ravens under 8.5 wins and still expect  browns to win the division. screensh overtime it.
nonrandomalpha,the overreaction on all things ravens this week is strong. crown em the champs i mean they did crush a team that is ostensibly imploding and purposely self sabotaging...but you know whatevs
nonrandomalpha,imagine if 15 years ago youd get into a strangers car by summoning them via a small handheld computer and youd trust them to take you to  years old you are destination.
LeeSharpeNFL,"the second is true. so the first.

the only possible argument for the first is his absurd amount of wr injuries actually making him that good but i'm n overtime buying it."
LeeSharpeNFL,excellent kickoff strategy in the half's final minute by kc. david toub is very good i miss him from when he was the bears special teams coordinator back in the hester years.
LeeSharpeNFL,"yeah i just use week 18 == wildcard ... week 21 == superbowl etc.

at le assit until the nfl screws me over by changing the playoff structure in the new cba."
LeeSharpeNFL,this is a really good thread (especially the lamar rocketship). definitely want to think about it as i look more at  expected points added /play situational tweaks giving me some good ideas....
LeeSharpeNFL,"my preseason projection for the vikings:

min
avg wins: 8.
playoffs: 45 percent 
win division: 31 percent 
have bye: 14 percent 
homefield: 6 percent 
win nfccg: 7 percent 
win sb: 3 percent"
LeeSharpeNFL,"nope i just wanted a quick metric for ""has more exciting plays/games"". agree there are more and better iterations on it. something fun for you to tackle as you learn r. :)"
LeeSharpeNFL,that drop for the bengals was awful. geez. he was looking ahead too soon when he had no need to nobody was near him and he had very little distance to travel.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i still want this rule change:

if you line up in an offensive formation and then call timeout you should n overtime be allowed to punt or attem point  a field goal."
LeeSharpeNFL,the world where the nfl is just never overturning pi on review is much better than the world where sometimes they do and sometimes they  daily fantasy sports  who can say really.
LeeSharpeNFL,i have  minutes at 94 percent  / 32 percent  / 20 percent  / 8 percent . can't show the leverage for the current week since they  daily fantasy sports  play of course.
LeeSharpeNFL,the whole thing is dumb. sucks when opi/dpi is called wrong in either direction but  it is  gonna happen. subjecting it to replay just seems absurd especially when nobody understands the standard.
whale_capper,i use a discrete distribution of actual team scores and if i project a league average performance i pick off the 50th percentile from the distribution which is 23 points i believe
whale_capper,its mostly been indexing prices of 6.5 and 6 back and forth to this point which doesnt indicate market consensus yet... market makers havent gotten involved yet if i had to guess
whale_capper,jordan g overtime two years off shaq was a completely different type of athlete and kawhi missed all of l assit season on top of sitting out 15 percent  of this season
whale_capper,good time of the season to take a crack at this the service point hold probabilities are a l overtime more stable for grass and the us hard court swing than clay
AndyMSFW,"i think a lotta shitty teams can excel around the holidays.  as is says in the good book ""but many who are first will be l assit and the l assit first."
AndyMSFW,the card?   it is  been ready for a while now just working on finding the perfect background photo.  running dangerously low on paulinas and want to save her for the british open.

JoeyKnish22,maybe a thanksgiving/black friday special odds-booster to move it back to 1000/1? ill add you to my thread. didnt know if circa had anything planned but this seems like a great opportunity.
JoeyKnish22,pat  need some help here getting this acce point ed and i dont see any maction player props? assuming you just took a long lunch and theyll be up soon 5k limits.
JoeyKnish22,my grandma (dead po you are one out ) used to buy scratch offs every single time she was at the gas station she never made a sports bet in her life.
JoeyKnish22,speaking of pods. this interview with ed norton is excellent one of the best simmons interviews in a long time. he talks for a good 10  minutes about rounders. really enjoyed it.
JoeyKnish22,you sell the guy on a rich tfc future as they roll into the conference finals when he wanted nothing to do with them and this is the thanks i get smdh.
JoeyKnish22,we just needed mr. big chest to keep it together and n overtime completely lose it for a couple more days and that fucking lunatic couldnt even make it to game 1.
TheKostos,im going to have nightmares about that texans/bucs game. houston forces five turnovers and scores one offensive touchdown and its a carlos hyde rushing  touchdown . lol. how is that even possible???!!!
TheKostos,back saturday for the two later games and then hosting  sunday morning and will give my picks there for sure followed by hours of tilting for fo you are fantasy title games
LockyLockerson,we discussed all of this on the  podcast l assit night in longer form worth checking out.  seems like a gap between p12 and oklahoma based on current rankings and matchups ahead
LockyLockerson,also in no world do i think michigan is better than ohio state. or that theyd win or be favored.  just in terms of who else these wisconsin results help clearly michigan.
LockyLockerson,glad you enjoyed it! week 0 i like miami a little at 7 week 1 i like oregon state at more than 10 havent dug in too far on that saturday yet
LockyLockerson,"lost in all of this is daryl morey probably has the best team in the west by far under contract but a couple weeks ago said theyre all available

whoops? just kidding?"
LockyLockerson,bahahaha the shut up this is the greatest show in history folks have showed up.  i mean i may n overtime laugh harder this year.  twitter.  oh man its the best sometimes.
LockyLockerson,who knows i pay attention to like 6 horse races a year lol. but sure is tem point ing to take some of these closer longshots in pools like the oaks/derby double.
EliHershkovich,value is there for sure  holtmann is one of the best up-and-coming coaches in the country. but they're probably a year away with a really young backcourt and a no go-to bucket-getter.

DannyParkins,i basically never yell or rant on the radio because its just sports but the revelation ryan pace didnt even have an extended meeting with deshaun watson is totally unacce point able.
DannyParkins,i agree but they wont. they make money and are part of the season ticket plan at full price. only way they will even shorten preseason is by adding regular season games.
DannyParkins,lol i honestly didn't know that was a scoop sorry. i credit you on air all the time. i read  years old you are piece but also read it from gonzo here:
DannyParkins,ive gotta say im loving my improm point u $400 david bote will have a 400+ plate attem point  season at some point as a big leaguer wager against  right about now
DannyParkins,darvish has no fastball command and his velocity is slightly down. hes at 60 pitches with 6 (!!!) walks and 4 ks through 2 with 1 run allowed so far. very ugly.
DannyParkins,this was my running thread of my six hours with les l assit night. heres a link to the podc assits i hope you enjoy it half as much as i did:
DannyParkins,sure if you want the cubs to be at a competitive disadvantage. they havent been primarily on a free superstation for many years. this is where media has gone and is going.
chadmillman,today on   and i went at it about seth curry (him) vs joe harris (me) in 3- point  contest. at le assit  figured out we chose the guys with the best value.
chadmillman,painful to admit but  wrote a smart forward-thinking piece about how ncaa  pro leagues need to handle shots-that- daily fantasy sports -count moments like in the iowa state-oklahoma game l assit night.
chadmillman,the  bracket is live. win money win free access to the site beat  years old you are friends follow along in the app so you're updated every time you win. good times
Gingfacekillah,market hasn't moved this much but i think  it is  high. khalil mack  co. will likely give cousins a tough time in a collapsed pocket. estimated range: 157 - 191 pass yards.
Gingfacekillah,anecdotally pitch control seems way down too. watching a l overtime of balls fail to get the desired movement towards the corners. just muffins right down the centre even from good pitchers.
Gingfacekillah,i just watched the first episode. this is basically unwatchable. a case study on every type of square tilting donkey degen behaviour. it would be comical if it wasnt so sad lol
Gingfacekillah,i mean its n overtime as easy as just loudly asserting i can beat 1.90 odds at a 70 percent  rate but its seems like the better path to statistically significant results
logan_matthews9,"alex is mostly right but some smaller books especially locals dont have their distributions right and you can get value. 

but paying a quarter for a half point is n overtime good"
logan_matthews9,"this is what feel gets you instead of math... 

im always amazed people dont at le assit break a calculator out to figure out the break even point on this kinda move"
logan_matthews9,im n overtime scamming people so why would i? i occasionally post lines i like if they are widely available but mostly i try and stop people from getting scammed by touts.
logan_matthews9,1) model games to get ideas of where the line should be/leans. this is mostly helpful for openers where lots of value can be added. its also probably the le assit important
logan_matthews9,worried seems like a weird word choice because it seems like they have a very obvious floor (6/7 seed first round exit) and very obvious ceiling (3 seed tough out in playoffs)

adamchernoff,$5m lost in 14 months! n overtime one time during the run was he asked by caesars for personal info or source of income. all cash across the border in bags. wild...
adamchernoff,oh this is one of these silly style points in gambling comments. so you're suggesting that a 885 yard game with 9 drives into the red zone should result in an under?
adamchernoff,"nfl week 5 show for

adamchernoff,basic strategy teasers have proven to be profitable over many seasons at a large sample size but some are more profitable than others. what are they and how do you identify them?
adamchernoff,the model pulls team hits for (season) starting pitcher hits allowed (career) and bullpen hits allows (season) data each night. a normal distribution projects probability for exact hits from 0-30 for each.

Ccon8181,"i see lots of ""pros"" putting out plays on first true day of # college football  with a short card. do they really have an edge or trying to sell a package?"
kellyinvegas,its a stay away for me at this point. havent heard anything regarding morale of the team and a free throw er bc that just isnt a risk im willing to take
kellyinvegas,sorry most people dont get life insurance for a baby sir. grandma was covered. go fund me is a community of people rallying around one another during a time of extreme tragedy.
kellyinvegas,we were 14 point favs today. inexcusable. should be 3 point dogs at tech and 3 point home dogs to isu. if we up 6-6 th against the spread a gd travesty.

ToddFuhrman,well played adam. dont let payne fool you talking to me 3x a week on the  podcast during the fall is the highlight of paynes year hes just afraid to admit it
ToddFuhrman,plenty of opportunity for the elite basketball prospect to perfect his cra free throw  elsewhere if his primary concern before making the nba is getting paid. football players a different case study

12Xpert,that is  a good question but from the recreational bookmaker's perspective it makes little difference because  it is  still likely the second kind of player will be exploiting the best market prices.
12Xpert,and when you're done with that have a read of something i wrote in 1997 (updated 1999) about climate change. aimed at university students but any reasonably educated person can follow it.
12Xpert,"more mugs playing means potential more positive expected value for you.

but to be clear it isn't 50-50. 

what's random is initial orientation angle and manner in which the coin is flipped."
12Xpert,when her trainer had been banned for getting athletes to do things against their will and getting them to take things he tells them are legal when they arent then go figure.
12Xpert,still the fact that actual roi is a l overtime lower might suggest some of the sports are n overtime fully efficient at pinny. soccer seems to be the only reliable one.
12Xpert,wrecked by people who had no real stake in anything at all because they will always be comfortable. like the 2008 financial crisis. capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses.
12Xpert,you will be welcome in my debating cafe where there are only two rules: no abuse and debaters have to ado point  a position they would normally oppose vehemently and defend it.
JambosPicks,picks are in including many of this week's  college football  plays! purchase a 1- or 4-week package at  today to see this week's recs and be eligible for o you are guarantee.
mschwimer,o you are plays destroy the close. go to o you are records page and check for yourself. we post all o you are plays and how they do vs. closing lines.
mschwimer,"step 1. register for free
step 2. go to records page and click cumulative record. 
step 3. scroll to bottom to see how all plays did vs market line and closing line."
mschwimer,n overtime true. he said point blank that he didnt believe o you are plays will win over the long haul and no one could make the financial guarantee we are making.
mschwimer,so are you saying that every single pick from 2/12 on is n overtime detailed on the site? if th against the spread what you are saying you are flat out wrong.
mschwimer,the emails are automated. i never received an email with that request. what email did you send it to? you could have simply asked nicely on twitter. no need to be mean.
RufusPeabody,missed on the gender and the name. 0-for-2. but utah is a great name too. i'm doing great! busy time of year as it undoubtedly is for you. how are you?
RufusPeabody,releasing  college football  totals on a tuesday morning . and here i thought  years old you are goal was to prove you all are the best sports predictors in the world.
RufusPeabody,were n overtime doing the washington post  college football  playoff column this year. i think fo you are people read it and it took a significant amount of time every week.
RufusPeabody,there are exce point ions but i generally lock in a bet as early as you can once limits are decent enough as markets generally move towards the more efficient number.
jeffma,the idea that it influences behavior and incentivizes subo point imal decision making is really interesting. people o free throw en fail to take into account the 50/50 nature of overtime
jeffma,latest episode of  where  proves that he is indeed a dog i mock his general existence and we talk all things gambling twitter. even some comments about o you are friend
jeffma,as a p against the spread fan that was present for the 18-1 super bowl. i can tell you these losses are a good thing for the w's and their fans
SportsCheetah,if you need a master class in nba tanking look no further than thunder-warriors nov. 25th 2019 with about 8 minutes le free throw  in the 4q and gs up 14.
SportsCheetah,"betting on which teams will be the top 5 consensus plays in the supercontest is some of #gamblingtwitters most degenerate work  and im here for it. 

peep  feed if youre interested."
capjack2000,"that one is a head-scratcher. for 98 percent  of bettors gambling is a negative expected value activity devoid of work ethic. 

maybe i can become the face of tennessee sports wagering."
capjack2000,oct margin is typically lower than se point  margin for a variety of reasons. however i think margin will u point ick slightly in october. i project about 9 percent  hold.
capjack2000,"20 points scored in the final minute of the mil/okc. meaningless when they had already hit the over right?

well n overtime if you were pointsbetting the under. 

which i was."
capjack2000,"whoever processes ncaa time changes for donbest should really consider working the overnight shi free throw . 

one ho you are before nfl kickoffs? n overtime ideal timing to clear pop-ups."
capjack2000,i feel like operators are now just getting nj licenses to speed the plow for the approval process in other states down the line. no intention of really competing in nj.
capjack2000,there are beta testers out there. i'm n overtime one. i've heard mixed thoughts on the platform. i'd just like to see it myself a free throw er all this build-up.
capjack2000,eventually they might with the eldorado deal. czr also has a deal with dra free throw kings. eldorado also has a deal with betstars. it could get messy down the line.
capjack2000,"oh come on national association of convenience stores you couldn't at le assit call yourself the society of national association of convenience stores to at le assit make this fun?

(snacs)"
capjack2000,i have to take issue with comparing this to card counting or phil iveys edge sorting. thwarting geolocation is a direct violation of regulations. whereas the other two activities are not.
capjack2000,th against the spread a big question. at this point im resigned to taking a wait-and-see approach. at the very le assit the ambiguity is bad o point ics for mlb.
capjack2000,in mlbs statement they said theyre in line with what is done in other international sports. does anyone have an example of an international sport that discloses information to sportsbooks first?
dinkinc,for someone who has been in the television / film industry for 20 years you have 2 followers. th against the spread one every ten years.  are you harvey weinsrein ?
dinkinc,hmmm. i guess we need to look at performances of horses who ship late both domestic and international. please have  years old you are findings in by 4 pm pacific jessica
dinkinc,so a free throw er some connecting some dots i find it quite interesting that both  and  both like indie wrestling...have respect for both and i guess even moreso now...   #bola19
dinkinc,if there is one thing i agree with  is he should n overtime be impeached...i worry enough about the gun violence that will occ you are when he gets voted out...
dinkinc,pretty much sit in front of a computer all day walk my dog and eat crappy foods.... every few weeks i go out of town but n overtime during hockey season
dinkinc,0-2 mlb   0-1 nfl    3 plays that had little or no chance ... the   horses are wondering how i could be sooo far wrong on all three.... so am i .....
robpizzola,every time radulov is out of the lineup it costs dallas 1.3 percent  in win expectancy. n overtime a statement that i would like to make even if he's occasionally lazy.
robpizzola,i cann overtime advocate for a player that was never elite as a single point in their career to go into the hof. that will always be my argument against eli.
robpizzola,"titans offense is 2.5 yards per play today lmaooooo

pretty sure i can assemble an offense of people that i follow on twitter and put together a better number than that."
robpizzola,yeah that was a complaint of many people but i honestly didn't care. they spent many seasons really building out the pl overtime and i am fine that they accelerated it.
RASPicks,true in some cases but there are plenty of influential bettors in the nflx market that can correct mistakes as they see fit especially a free throw er a line moves.
RASPicks,finished week 1  college football  9-4. now 84-47 (64.1 percent ) in  college football  since start of 2009 season. 15 of 17 winning weeks. week 2 sides will be released today.
VegasRefund,i guarantee you most football fans aren't aware that the clock only stops when you go out of bounds under 2  minutes in the 1h and under 5  minutes in 4th.
VegasRefund,"red sox are -350 with a total of 9 tonight. chris sale returns from the dl and is on a pitch count of about 40. 

eovaldi is expected to relieve sale."
VegasRefund,"colangelo is either...
1. coward for letting his wife take the fall.
2. coward for n overtime leaving his wife for this if he actually had no idea it was happening."
VegasRefund,this weeks players championship doesnt have a golfer with odds below 11/1.. cant remember the l assit time a big tournament like this didnt have a couple of clear cut favorites.
VegasRefund,"for those of you who have participated in the fantasy golf majors pools in the p assit its now open.. if you havent id highly recommend checking it out.

VegasRefund,"michigan has literally zero shot
nova is going to decapitate them
nova is free money

just a few of the comments ive heard today.. as most of you have as well."
VegasRefund,ended up just skipping ahead to rewatch the finale of true detective s1.. while s1 is arguably one of the best shows/seasons ever.. it absolutely has the all-time best finale imo.
ProfessorShine,i think its ok to be hypersensitive in this new age of uber-predatory marketing that exploded with legalization.  we g overtime the wsj out here calling rj an oddsmaker for chrissakes
ProfessorShine,i believe theyre friends with the developer of the app.   they have been critical of tans hiring and directly made fun of schwartz.  compare that to someone like rovell or joffe.
ProfessorShine,i dont want them giving me data they think i should have.  give me all of it or at le assit what i ask for. gross percentages isnt what i want.
suuma810,a free throw er two weeks the #giants rank 1st in  expected points added  per rush with an assit onishing number of 0.367. they are 0-2 and have been outscored 31-63.
suuma810,"they balance their sharp action and/or let people make bad bets.

but if you find a good bet on a key number buying points will usually make it a bad bet."
suuma810,me neither but i prefer decision making over results. he said he goes for it 10 times out of 10. i also like him setting the tone: we play to win.
suuma810,the total in the #cowboys / #panthers game g overtime bet down from 44 to 42.5 in some places yesterday. opener was 44.5. coaching tendencies will be crucial in this one.
suuma810,"football is coming and so is #betting! a free throw er this weekend i will fine-tune my ratings and we will start locking in plays later next week!

get on board"
ClevTA,to think that punting the ball to the #1 pick in the dra free throw  is the same as punting to a mediocre qb is the definition of apples to oranges
ClevTA,id say baker is ahead so far right now but if u compared the ol and the lack of skill position for darnold its a l overtime closer than raw numbers
ClevTA,they'll be favored in every one of those gms. zona will be close but if they win a bunch in a row prior to the zona gm they def will be
ClevTA,said this a few days ago. there should be zero reason why this isn't a 25 carry nick chubb game. if i see tons of 5 wide em point y sets....
CizzlingSports,yeah but what abt the time a random internet frand sent u fruit roll ups to celebrate the birth of the child who's never gonna hear abt this awful web sight
CizzlingSports,"i already factored in guarantees for all closed losing packages in the numbers above.

as we know however jambos loves pretending that guarantees on open losing packages have already been paid."
CizzlingSports,cashed out like $500 in chips a free throw er playing blackjack and had to get approval at cage etc. place was a complete dump in every single possible way lol
spanky,"im supposed to start the  show soon. 

i feel weird talking to myself for a long period of time.

i have no idea where to start. 

im lost. 

looking for answers."
spanky,"the one thing i can promise you is that i will never give out any picks ever.  

my business is dynamic. we usually dont know what were betting until seconds before."
spanky,"for us its college hoops. way too many games for bookmaker to keep up with. 

props are also very beatable in most sports as bookmakers put those up as a concession."
spanky,to all dead beat bettors out there. if you cant pay the man then dont play! if you expect to be paid when you win you should pay when you lose.
spanky,99.9 percent  of the accounts i bet into are via betting partners where my involvement is unknown to the bookmaker...  years old you are claim is bullshit but thanks for trying.
spanky,im traveling cross country and need to plan on betting june 1st at golden gate. how much are you going to be taking mlb moneylines on june 1st at golden gate?
spanky,in the p assit ive waited almost 3 minutes for approval.  the action i put now is limited as i am waiting on a response from ceo if delays are gone...
spanky,no sportsbook can ever pay me to endorse them.  my endorsements come from my real life experience.  can you book me? you're either a bookmaker (     ) or a dressmaker (
spanky,lmao. im n overtime a tout. ive never sold a pick ever.  ive probably bet more l assit weekend than youll make  years old you are entire life!  be easy kiddo...
DocBettor,i do a l overtime of live in-game betting and from my experience the offshore o point ions are better than the legal ones right now. higher limits and more liquidity.
PlusEVAnalytics,thanks - so if the hourly forec assit says 20 percent  every ho you are and the daily forec assit says 20 percent  today th against the spread internally inconsistent right?
PlusEVAnalytics,if you think the point spread had anything to do with the decision you must be one of those to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail guys.
aluckyaday,every bet advised price sp bfsp actual and expected returns and the theoretical chance of that return being down to luck updated every day. no wonder i have so few subscribers
aluckyaday,fantasy by wisdom of the crowd. you might be on to something. is it allowed/legal for employees of  daily fantasy sports  companies who might have access to such data to play?
aluckyaday,obviously n overtime a linear relationship. need to put  years old you are  moneyline hat on and fit an outrageously wiggly decision boundary which is sure to predict the future correctly
aluckyaday,the same tweet is talking bollocks and talking sense. the joys of betting twitter  thanks for  years old you are input very long time since i've been in a uk shop.
aluckyaday,yeah but their smaller packages come with guarantees as well. it would be quite an interesting thing to model. lots of actuarial assum point ions would have to be made though!
aluckyaday,a fixed limit is just n overtime practical. peoples disposable income is n overtime fixed. losing 10k for some is nothing losing 10 for others can tip them over the edge.
aluckyaday,if i've done the maths correctly -108 is a margin of about 3.7 percent . todays pinny moneyline prices are about 2 percent  margin. runline a little higher about 2.4 percent
aluckyaday,"the people it hurts most are ""pros"" hence spankys complaints. it actually benefits recreational players. they get many more prop bets which they enjoy plus loads of  free bets and offers."

joeytunes2,lol i was telling my friend l assit night. how brutal i am at writing and or spell check. i'm always doing 120 mph. i'm actively trying to get better lol.
joeytunes2,yes. what about the 11 teams better then them in west. and all the moves that will happen in offseasons. they didnt even get ad.  years old you are buying rumors.
joeyisaks,but in this case its avid bettors who are talking down to someone who covers betting professionally and paid well yet a free throw er a year + is still clueless
joeyisaks,you cant quit when you arent actually betting as they have said they arent and if you lose you pay 10k so you might as well play huge volume at openers
joeyisaks,well ya but that would require action network to have access to a professional or any real operation... so these are the stories  years old you are gonna get from them
joeyisaks,p against the spread open pk (too low) and total of 59 (a little too high) will be a great superbowl! il be in kansas city for the third place game.
joeyisaks,every nba and mlb for p assit 5 years ive been at theres someone within 5 se against the spread live betting either game im at or another game goin on
joeyisaks,congr against the spread to nc atat on the hsbc championship! alcorn state g overtime robbed on that 2 pointer tho! much more entertaining than new mexico bowl and automation bowl
EdMillerPoker,darren would you be willing to pledge to help this kid get back on his feet should his luck turn and he finds himself with some financial problems due to losses?
EdMillerPoker,without going into it too much this is basically the reason. we wont require this for every d expected value position in the future but we need it for this one.
EdMillerPoker,if i have spare coding time i want to make a semi-automated process to tweet o you are numbers on these decisions. right now its a little cumbersome for the trader.
EdMillerPoker,"this is the status quo in-game product.

by adverse selection he means that sportsbook operators are using a delayreject scheme to try to wallpaper over the flaws in their in-game lines."
EdMillerPoker,in many cases bookmaking philosophy is as much a defensive response to specific technical limitations as anything else. tho youd then want to adjust the philosophy if those limitations get addressed.
EdMillerPoker,right it doesnt require an altruistic donor but an altruistic donor substantially increases the possible viable combinations. i think as usual a big hurdle is figuring who pays what for whom.
GolcondaFund,"should watch james cameron's doc on netflix.
talks about the faulty science behind animal protein and the professional athletes who have quicker recovery eating plant based. this guy is even onboard"
GolcondaFund,"did you do circa?
we are 12-2-1 there get extra night to sleep on sc picks. been helping a l overtime so far exce point  lw's jets -6.5....g overtime too cute."
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  model them as different from regular season games. i know 538 does though if i ado point ed that then i would favor no by even more.
LeeSharpeNFL,"tired: the seahawks are the cowboys are the seahawks

wired: seahawks are 12-3 and in the playoffs cowboys are 8-8 and not.

inspired: seahawks are -1 point differential cowboys are +113"
LeeSharpeNFL,i recall someone having told me that the nfl doesn't allow teams to have a computer running models or similar during games but i'm n overtime sure where i remember this.
LeeSharpeNFL,few. the failure though comes from n overtime making the effort to find someone good who you can outsource this to.  that is  part of the qualities you list in parenthesis.
LeeSharpeNFL,that is interesting and makes sense. also shows the value of n overtime kicking off into the end zone (which is probably n overtime what the nfl wants teams to do).
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm n overtime doing any changes to  expected points added  currently. i *think* ben is waiting for an nflscrapr fix? the bug shouldn't affect too much if you're doing aggregate analysis.
whale_capper,you nailed one of the most interesting observations... the numbers are an average of the look ahead lines weeks 1-16 and overall the browns are way under lined across the board...
whale_capper,yeah  that is  tough... somewhat of a leap of faith that pop has one more adjustment to deploy and denver will come in with the same look they've been rolling with
AndyMSFW,"i will be walking in and buying two tickets and watching it myself.  i just can't deal with saying ""for one"" to that smarmy little 19 year old running the counter."
AndyMSFW,this cheered me up december may be a bit underrated for sports months with bowl szn nfl playoff races and college ball transitioning to conference play.  (also nba christmas day jerseys)
AndyMSFW,"food $200

AndyMSFW,"nice nugget and something to look for this season. especially if we see it in denver where they signed the king of the ""hope for pi underthrow""  (avi blurred for anonymity)"
AndyMSFW,it is  the #usopen! outrights! match-ups! props! paulina!  also tomorrow's  will have a golf guest to help everyone make some halfway decent bets should be a fun weekend at pebble beach.
JoeyKnish22,im 100 percent  telling the story of l assit super bowl a certain book offering live betting o point ions on gatorade color and us dming with you in the stadium.
JoeyKnish22,glad to see youre spending christmas eve worrying about a post i tweeted from l assit week to protect some friends john. quite a fulfilling life you all lead. happy holidays.
JoeyKnish22,also who was he talking about lol. you le free throw  off a qb arguably the front runner. i would pay to know who he had in mind for the laugh.
JoeyKnish22,was informed and confirmed this morning  corrected this and graded the props a winner. good on them for making it right and thanks to those who assisted in getting it fixed.
JoeyKnish22,mls playoffs this weekend. hopefully somebody steals my phone by friday so i dont cash in my 401k already g overtime a plasma donation appointment set for monday morning just incase.
JoeyKnish22,i would still bet the 75.5 th against the spread out there if i hadnt already g overtime action down. i also took some alt totals over 100 over 120 etc.
JoeyKnish22,cant remember who posted it. but there was pph shops hanging moli n overtime top 20 (-120). probably one of the most brutal golf be against the spread ive ever seen.
TheKostos,it was an outrageous decision. i loved it bc i bet dallas but still its so bad. and i love aikman just destroying the cowboys coaching staff on the broadc assit
TheKostos,whatever. i won with tulsa l assit night and legitimately  daily fantasy sports  remember putting that bet in lol. woke up this morning and saw i placed it and was shocked
TheKostos,matt mitchell  is the gambling personality you didnt know you needed to follow. great dude and absolutely hysterical. if you like sports gambling follow my man and you wont be disappointed
TheKostos,"it is  time.

week 10 picks against the spread .

and this week i'm letting the hate flow through me.

ride the #kostoscoaster to a winning week -- and to insanity!!!"
TheKostos,gotta remember this is just the first leg. that definitely plays into strategy. the second legs are generally more insane because both teams will know exactly what they need to advance
TheKostos,"i like the proposed mlb changes the sport has absolutely zero juice and most impoantly...

more playoff teams = more shit to bet on 

how is this n overtime a win????"
TheKostos,we begin tonight's  (6p et) with a sprawling look at tonight's nba/ college basketball  cards. thoughts/analysis on every nba game and every big  college basketball  game. picks  best bets strewn throughout.
TheKostos,flight 4957 to jfk landed an ho you are ago. bags nowhere to be found at claim. people standing around wondering wh against the spread happening. do you have an eta
TheKostos,the beluga 1.0s are a 10 the others are 10.5. my true size is 10 but i usually go up a half size for 350s but the belugas fit me great

LockyLockerson,. can you recap all  years old you are nfl bets real quick so i can put in the fade parlay a free throw er  years old you are 100-0 saturday
LockyLockerson,toronto-lakers during nfl season in the sunday night 9:30 et time slot? i think these were the exact conditions when kobe scored 82 (exce point  it was a couple months later).
LockyLockerson,i just think they're ok but n overtime a contender for anything particularly special this year and are being rated like a 95-10 win team who could maybe make the playoff.
LockyLockerson,if the closing number was weird on each of their l assit couple games then that would cause this number to be weird as well.  just kind of a domino effect.
LockyLockerson,"136 (1.36 percent  so +7253 would be their ""true"" futures price if this were gospel which  it is  n overtime because we  daily fantasy sports  know the real bracket at all)"
EliHershkovich,sure for any team in the cfp. but among programs with a legitimate sh overtime (clemson 'bama georgia osu oklahoma michigan) u-m definitely has the most value based on potential odds.

DannyParkins,well you've now tweeted me twice in the l assit 90 seconds on a sunday night so you must care about me a little. i appreciate ya have a good day.
DannyParkins,there was no pressure in 2016 when a 108 year world series drought was ongoing and they trailed 3-1 in the world series?  that is  n overtime how i remember it.
DannyParkins,i never said i know what happened. its just amazing to me you could have followed this whole case from the beginning and think hes 100 percent  innocent and trust him.
DannyParkins,steph said something to drake a free throw er that klay bucket. great sequence. also i coulda swore that was a legal putback by boogie id like that one explained postgame.
DannyParkins,10 years to the day since the bears g overtime cutler we're playing dan terry hub and mully from that day in a best of 10 minutes. crazy to hear now.
DannyParkins,i'll save my thoughts on losing 2 of 3 to the rangers while scoring 28 runs the cubs bullpen darvish moncada giolito and the opening weekend of chicago baseball for 2pm
DannyParkins,the president of the nfl player's union is a smart thoughtful guy who is always a great interview. pumped to be joined by eric winston at 5:00  to talk nfl issues.
chadmillman,reading the rays-as wild card breakdown by  struck by this which he proves: any way you slice it charlie morton has been one of the most underrated pitchers in recent memory.
chadmillman,in honor of mother's day i offer this bit of genius about umpires impacting outcomes in the rangers-astros and cards-pirate games. because who is better at umpiring disputes than a mom?
chadmillman,yesterday was loyola as a dog and mich/fl assit under (#greendotcity). today is something i rarely do: chalk in both games: nova -6.5 and duke -3. follow on  app download at
chadmillman,heard this a l overtime p assit few days. p against the spread drama makes you more likely to bet on them now.  years old you are instincts may be right.
chadmillman,"anyone  have 12;20pm est on jan 28 2020 as ""the day  becomes the guy telling someone to do something on time?"" 

cc:       

that p overtime has to be massive by now."
chadmillman,im o free throw en asked wh against the spread happening with sports betting? and n overtime just by my in-laws in a judgy way. enjoyed breaking it down with for
Gingfacekillah,i like #29 because it has a clear math/stats/data science vibe. #45 is also good because it clearly relates more to excel. it'll be interesting to see how the voting goes!
Gingfacekillah,player model version #2 test tonight.  million  under. if you've been following along you already know n overtime to put too much faith in this but we'll see how it goes.
Gingfacekillah,...and just like that my forec assit has tightened right up. lean on det and the over. time to test player model version #2 and see how it goes moving forward.
Gingfacekillah,it would seem nonsensical to reward a players skill assessment for variance that comes from the random domain rather then the skill domain as per  years old you are previous work.
Gingfacekillah,th against the spread the real challenge. how does one camouflage an + expected value betting profile? keep it within standard deviation of chance? mix in negative positive expected value plays?
logan_matthews9,but unless theres a massive standard deviation for  college basketball  theres a better than 40-to-1 chance of one of those two numbers hitting and im positive that makes the middle +ev
logan_matthews9,so i finally wrap up a golf model th against the spread taken me a while to put together... and naturally the next event is brand new with no historical data
PikachuBets,how is this great stuff lol its only for mls and has a ton of unnecessary rows that are just clutter. also doesnt break out vig closing line value vs nvclv
PikachuBets,this tweet is gold. you really have no idea that cizzle is dunking on you with that tweet and being hella sarcastic right? you need to get 6969 clues and pronto
PikachuBets,who cares about the details it is clear rlm brah  daily fantasy sports  think  years old you are brain into a panties wad i heard boxers are better for that anyway
PikachuBets,"lol  it is  like they just threw some darts and ended up like ""nahhhh...we can just put all 3 of these ivy leaguers together no one will really notice anyway!"" lol"
PikachuBets,forgive me father for i have sinned. i tweeted about a non-gambling thing for the first time ever i think and now my notifications are getting rimmed. i regret everything lol
adamchernoff,to be fair sitting in my chair and looking neglected so i cant look at football is a + expected value strategy in terms of generating guilt to encourage a walk.
adamchernoff,couple great submissions so far. i can see this is going to be a l overtime of fun.  let us  up the stakes to a $200 amazon gi free throw  card.
adamchernoff,im doing all the publishing locally and then shipping out myself. i pick up the first 100 copies mid next week and will post details shortly on how to get one.
adamchernoff,23/37 for 279 (7.7 ypa) 1  touchdown  1 int and an 82 rating. hes actually below his road average in all categories. thanks for listening and taking the time to comment.

Ccon8181,i dont like the 2nd half lines for the side or total in this #dukevsunc game.. gonna let it ride and hopefully it plays out well for the good guys. #duke
Ccon8181,classic #clemson .. in control could pull away but start with the antics and go prevent late in the half.. done things never change. put them in the category with louisville.
Ccon8181,lead by example!! guy was mia on defense and g overtime beat for every loose ball. could tell a free throw er game 3 presser he mailed it in. #warriors -4.5
Ccon8181,anyone  that is  followed me knows how bad #georgetown #hoyas did us l assit year. they start this year -5.5 favs up 7 with a  minutes le free throw  and lose.
Ccon8181,i own it when i lose and had the worst # college basketball  season on record finishing 4 games below .500 but more then made up for it with #nba season
kellyinvegas,this isnt fraudulent. i talked about this game all week on  and  ive been told no one cares you g overtime a better number kelly so ive stopped talking about it.
ToddFuhrman,"perce point ion sometimes becomes reality in the sports betting market

cowboys were -3/3.5 in lookahead numbers against the rams; game down to a pk trending towards rams as road favorites"
ToddFuhrman,"the cruel world of gambling...

if you've spent all game rooting for dallas suddenly with 1:44 to go you find yourself rooting for  a ne 1st down to win a bet"
ToddFuhrman,today was one of the most important days for  football in a long time; league maintains national relevance if they get 11-1 utah vs 11-1 oregon in the conference title game
ToddFuhrman,daily fantasy sports  let the secret out...or share the fact their toughest opponent to date as far as ypg offense is ole miss at 57th in the country vs fbs opponents
ToddFuhrman,who thinks a team of 18 and 19 year olds will beat grown men? if a nfl team wanted to take it seriously theyd cover 30 by hal free throw ime
ToddFuhrman,unfortunately if you're seeking true odds for any in-play market laying the favorite is always going to put you in a better situation for value than taking long sh overtime dogs
ToddFuhrman,even more reason to keep them for later in the year when the rest of the pool can only use them once; mirroring the competition kills  years old you are edge
ToddFuhrman,let  years old you are voice be heard degenerate nation! when it comes to stand alone  college football  over the holiday weekend how will you bet them the next 2 days?
ToddFuhrman,durant coming n overtime contingent on davis...if it was then my tune changes completely but kd to nyc is about as close to a done deal as there is right now
ToddFuhrman,payne...you're a huge x's and o's guy who would be  years old you are top choice (money and current affiliation n overtime withstanding) to run the program in the beilein mold?
ToddFuhrman,well take the profit but definitely would have been nice to snag 3-1. bruins late penalty stung couldnt get possession to settle it down a free throw er the successful kill
ToddFuhrman,all grading of nfl futures post once the season is complete so th against the spread baked into the total win and handle youre seeing reported by both states as well
TheCousinSal,the bills defense was dynamite in the first half. the cowboys are lucky to be down by 6.  cant complain here. so i guess this was a waste of a tweet.
TheCousinSal,i think im ready to install the ravens as the first team i cant bet against for the rest of the season. that decision unfortunately came several hundred dollars too late.
TheCousinSal,bummed that i lost with my rams pick on  super psyched that russell hustle and bustle man muscle wilson gave me a 32.6  point . head start vs.  overrated fantasy squad.
TheCousinSal,thanks to  for allowing the degenerate trifecta and i to make fools of ourselves at their super cool performance facility.  ill be honest - the orange club head doesnt help.    #againstallodds
TheCousinSal,as we anxiously wait to see who will select  best of luck  best of luck in this years dra free throw  lets pay tribute to his late father manute...a fascinating specimen.
TheCousinSal,im aware that this is going to stir up some controversy - but if a jockey falls off his horse at the starting gate that jockey should be put down. #fairisfair
TheCousinSal,i was wrong about the amari cooper trade. hes kind of perfect for this offense.  possession receiver who extends drives. were easily winning 8 games this year. bring on who dat?!
TheCousinSal,i now feel silly about getting excited this am when my 4 year-old hit the ball over the coach-pitchers head.  justify is only 3 and has a much brighter future. #kentuckyderby2018
TheCousinSal,on an all-new against all odds the degenerate trifecta and i review giannis vs. lebron mvp odds + we give you all 6 major ncaa conference championship winners absolutely free. #gambling

p-value = 0.15

12Xpert,most racing tipsters would average much longer than 3.43 although it would also be true to say that the no-skill expectation would be more greatly negative because of favourite-longsh overtime bias.
12Xpert,brilliant just brilliant the way the current labo you are movement is trashing its own history. no need to stop with blair out them all jc is o you are saviour.
12Xpert,no they definitely take into account biases. in particular the favourite longsh overtime bias but i remove the influence of that when estimating the  fair odds for this kind of analyses.
12Xpert,if you're really claiming to have had 3 losing lays in 17877 where lay odds are as short as 2/5 then you can't really expect anyone to believe this is genuine.
12Xpert,"found n overtime to have implied knowledge can be applied to sports betting to ensure success. well you couldn't make this up could you.

mschwimer,thank you for bringing this to my attention.  i will answer this on twitter as i take this very seriously.  i am investigating the issue now.  will have an answer shortly.
mschwimer,changes to ts and cs are coming. but that wont change because its way better for the sub. ask any lawyer. arbitration much cheaper than a court case for the sub.
mschwimer,n overtime true. they are n overtime passive at all. they are the company!! we have limited partners but those names are general partners. they hold the risk same as me.
mschwimer,all o you are plays are posted for everyone to see. they are time stamped and were available for free to the public. we had hundreds of subs. check for yourself!
mschwimer,we have been very h overtime lately but o you are closing line value has not. this is n overtime a good sign for future plays so please proceed with caution!
mschwimer,im n overtime smart enough to breakdown the complexities of isas as it relates to baseball in a single tweet. if i tried i would be leaving incredibly important information out.
mschwimer,if the eagles use mccoy more in the passing game they will win... in 4 out of the 6 games he has caught less than 4 passes... this is a joke
mschwimer,i guess it is unfair to give a prize to a number follower. so from now on every 5k i get i will randomly pick a follower to win a prize!

RufusPeabody,i dont know what that is but it seems to me that you could have two shots from the same xy coordinates that have very different xg. am i wrong?

jeffma,i give plus expected value my proxy vote.  can i send him  years old you are phone number and he can do the call  and back and forth with you?
jeffma,n overtime being a ucf apologist but i havent heard any of the mainstream media mention that they were missing their starting qb. probably makes a difference in that game
jeffma,better half of   joins the me and the worser half  on  to talk what mistakes were made during the dra free throw  and the true definition of the word moneyball
jeffma,i understand what you are saying but you are more sophisticated than most bettors. if the pick sellers market themselves with the nuance that you are describing god bless them
SportsCheetah,if josh allen throws a pass in the wind in the forest and nobody sees it did josh allen really ever throw a pass at all? something to think about.
SportsCheetah,yeah i meant for game 4. honestly you stopped hitting 0 percent  in like 2016 i just g overtime excited i may n overtime have to sweat a game 5.
SportsCheetah,the funny part is it doesnt matter anyway theres no line since they dont even have a game i was just relaying the news and bummed about over 6 wins.

geocomply knows a ridiculous amount about  years old you are online betting session in nj. dont even bother trying to circumvent it. seriously."
capjack2000,"what some in florida are proposing is that they dont tax the seminoles at all and let small racinos (who are taxed) try to compete with that behemoth.

capjack2000,offshore book yes extremely likely to be cancelled. you could always call and alert them and see if they kick you some freeplay as a thank you. ymmv of course.
capjack2000,this guy is worlds better than their previous ceo. had they followed this approach from the start tan might n overtime be so despised by those who understand sports betting.
capjack2000,i like this approach. however does the bill still require local elections to authorize it? would they really attem point  a patchwork of geolocations assuming some districts o point  out?
capjack2000,n overtime a one. i pitched it to william hill back when they ran parlay-only in delaware. it would work well in a market with a strong local team bias.

dinkinc,thanks jessica .... i am so torn between my love of handicapping and my disgust at the phony efforts to make the game safer.. maybe there is no middle ground...
dinkinc,1-2 fir the  horses. this is going to be the first losing month in quite some time but it is what it is .. no excuses.  did my usual work.
dinkinc,you mean the two guys who were offered a huge contract from wwe and turned it down so they can run a company as they feel wrestling should be presented..

robpizzola,i think a fundamental part of being a wide receiver is being able to receive the ball. could be wrong. seems like a problem for cooper on a regular basis.
robpizzola,believe me they have a million contingency plans. remember the platinum super bowl party raid and how quickly they g overtime a new site up and spinning? wont take long.
robpizzola,well im assuming they didnt take any money back so that they can make a play for a free agent forward but yikes th against the spread a bad return.
robpizzola,think about the scenarios if they dont unload marleau. it absolutely needed to happen. of course there was going to be a cost but this core needs to stay intact.
robpizzola,that goal could n overtime be reviewed because couture was called for a penalty on the ice. we dont know what that call would have been had it been reviewed.

RASPicks,22 days 658 lined games - no market is better than  college basketball  in november.  this is why ras stops  college football  early and doesn't do mlb nba or nfl.
RASPicks,the  percent  of sports services who win long term is very comparable to (if n overtime lower than) the  percent  of the general public that wins long term. #1 percent

VegasRefund,somethings up with gurley. rams second series going to the sideline his ankle g overtime rolled up on. no obvious limp but the body language tells a different story imo.
VegasRefund,if this breaking bad movie has walter white in it... i will start standing in line for tickets the day  it is  announced. even if  it is  two years out.
VegasRefund,better off live-betting this duke/unc game.. duke the heavy public side while they went from -1.5 to +1.5 today. definitely smells.. but then again virginia was fine l assit night.
ProfessorShine,many eagles fans simply parr overtime what they hear on local radio.  fact is pederson still makes correct decisions  his roster from top to bottom play incredibly hard for him.
suuma810,haben aber keinen grund ihn unter wert zu traden. der wert steigt sobald sich bei teams der need erhht oder rosen im camp und in der pre gute leistungen zeigt.
suuma810,"when kirk cousins is the starter his teams are now 3-18 su  5-15-1 against the spread  against playoff teams. this includes lar no chi  ne this year.

next opponent: #seahawks"
suuma810,the correlation between pace of play  offensive scoring is -0.033 (r2=0.001). season-long data from 2011-2017. it doesnt matter how f assit you get to the los you gotta be efficient.
ClevTA,if u dont think jimmy haslam saw the rise and success of analytics with harbaugh and the ravens. this is a copy cat league and i am all for it
ClevTA,what in the world is that call in philly? once goedert crosses the ez its a  touchdown . this isnt in the middle of the field. what a horrible call
ClevTA,its just my model that spits out expected spreads and it has tulane -8. temples offense is 117th in yards per play. but i dont have much else besides that
ClevTA,tos are more random than anything but i wasnt predicting what will happen just that the pit offense has been bad and has solely relied on benefit of the tos
ClevTA,its as if defenders who have also dropped potential ints from baker (1st pass of season v ten for ex) is completely ignored by fans. it can go both ways
ClevTA,always good to see someone move the goal posts to fit their pick. thx for the input no idea why u feel the need to defend whatever pick u took
ClevTA,omg im catching up on todays show and they had duhamel on and replayed the clip for him of ryan hollins saying the robots were racist in transformers. so good
CizzlingSports,"he generally doesnt pick both sides like  but he (clay) does give out different lines and weights on his site tv periscope etc. (but never lists prices lol)

fraud lyfe"
CizzlingSports,seems lyke ppl with + expected value nfl betting information might be too busy on sun mornings to host negative expected value betting shows but  i do n overtime know
CizzlingSports,n overtime me. i showed him how stupid he is on the merits and g overtime the blockity-block because that was just easier for him than actually thinking i guess
spanky,i wish you or anyone else would show videos of this practice taking place.. completely unethical to know what a player wants to bet and then air move on him.
spanky,maybe someone could fill in the fo you are variables of chance each team scores a fig and a  touchdown ... i wanna be convinced im just n overtime lol....
spanky,dont worry greg. these guys mean well. theyve been busting my balls since i came on here. they just hate touts with a passion - albeit sometimes an unhealthy one.
spanky,all depends on why it moved that hard and if it could go to 10.   multiple injuries could cause that.. i definitely will wind up with at le assit +7.5
spanky,"why someone likes a game is what 99.99 percent  of people talk about. 

i feel my expertise lies in the art of betting lines and the timing of that art."
spanky,flying in tomorrow to vegas.  looking forward to chillin with some cool people that i already know and others that ill meet for the first time. gonna be a blast!
spanky,i like the complete book of sports betting by jack moore. i also like conquering risk by feustel and howard.  i still own all my books and never traded them
spanky,growing up i was terrified of king kong bundy.  i remember once at msg he looked down at me and growled and i ran to my mom. rip big man.
spanky,my case was actually ny state and  n overtime one of 25 defendants went to prison.  if youre gonna hate at le assit get  years old you are facts straight.
spanky,time of year when im losing outs faster than i can replenish them.  the ability to get down is the most important factor for success.  winning is the easy part.
PlusEVAnalytics,this may seem like a non-prediction but i think this game lands 20+ away from the spread and/or the total. so jets -3 ravens -37 over 64 or under 24.
PlusEVAnalytics,do you regret the bravado and arrogance you displayed in  years old you are beef with  ? he regrets the method but n overtime the message - tours are scum.
PlusEVAnalytics,this is where  obnoxious as he is nails it. bet into them with a thousand accounts and when they get banned get a thousand more. dont get mad get even.
PlusEVAnalytics,if this is done out of a misguided sense of i g overtime this leadership its bad. if its a matter of i gotta get mine selfishness its really bad.
PlusEVAnalytics,if youre dealing in risk $ (n overtime to-win $) youll be slightly under exposed because a dollar bet at -130 is less exposure than a dollar bet at -106.
PlusEVAnalytics,bad math aside the exposure is still 15m. the difference to him between the assit ros winning and n overtime winning is 15m in cash. the mattress economics are irrelevant.
PlusEVAnalytics,recommending that people hedge  years old you are bets in-play is a great idea if youre getting affiliate commissions. happy fucking birthday wasnt enough now its merry fucking christmas too
PlusEVAnalytics,related: go buy a lottery ticket today because  years old you are chance of winning is 1 in 2! (either you win or you dont) happy probability ignorance day everyone!
PlusEVAnalytics,are political campaign ads really effective? why doesnt one of these guys take their ad budget and feed the homeless instead? wouldnt that generate more buzz for the same spend?
aluckyaday,i've heard it said that the uk gambling commission is a facilitator n overtime a regulator. maybe like the rest of the us industry they are just following europe's lead
aluckyaday,plus 365 tend to restrict you to pennies if you show an inkling of knowing what you are doing. so free throw  books for recreational players sharp books for sharps!
aluckyaday,"i think this says a l overtime about what ""taking back control"" really means. we can screw the environment and nhs so o you are friends can become even richer."
aluckyaday,just shows the world we now live in. 5 people injured in a suspect terrorist knife attack in manchester and its n overtime even the first thing on bbc news.
aluckyaday,for o you are american friends. i've seen very little talk about problem gambling in the american media. is america ready for the consequences that freely available gambling can bring?
aluckyaday,coding is one of those few jobs where  years old you are work can be  years old you are hobby. we are in the same league as professional sports players
aluckyaday,beware the enhanced accumulator. stradivarius (14.25) threat (15.00)  ten sovereigns (15.35) all to win 8/1. same bookmaker's prices on the three 4/913/813/8. a treble would pay 8.95/1. enhanced for who?
aluckyaday,blaming bookmakers for someones addiction is the same as blaming a supermarket for selling alcohol. an easy o point ion but it distracts from the real cause of the addictions.
aluckyaday,you are being too us focused. gambling has been around as long as mankind can count. liquid markets have had plenty of time to develop if they were going to.
aluckyaday,i think they should race it in reverse. see if alla can make up the time on the descent and then if the rest can catch him on the flat!
aluckyaday,i think they should run the stage in reverse. see if alla can get enough back on the descent and then if the rest can catch him on the flat!
aluckyaday,that looks a l overtime bigger than the small chance boris is implying. looks like the markets believe the eu and n overtime him when he says they will negotiate!
aluckyaday,did you look at profit using opening odds rather than closing? that might help to determine if bookmakers are specifically targeting this bias by adjusting their true odds at open?
aluckyaday,maybe fan duel is run by a uk bookmaker that has many years of experience in how to maximize turnover from recreational players and restrict + expected value bettors effectively.
aluckyaday,"my theory is the ""one-off decisions"" are n overtime that one off. we just  daily fantasy sports  have the information required to move them from the random to systematic category."

joeytunes2,introduced me to b overtime betting 10 years ago. even though we hunt for the same outs we remain friends and help each other out. good luck this season bud.
joeyisaks,action network gives terrible betting tips what are they worth? dont think its quality of tips that = how much companies are worth . barstool is a media empire (unfortunately)
joeyisaks,sharp money was def n overtime on seahawks... n overtime sure if you read that on action network or something but only sharp action was when vikings would hit +3.5

nonrandomalpha,why are you so desperate to find isolated incidents to tout this bum? do you care more about the team and winning or just love sick with one individual player?
nonrandomalpha,many of the folks who criticize lebron are simultaneously devout jordan fans but somehow must still be racists because they criticize lebron?  years old you are logic is airtight. thanks.
nonrandomalpha,"how'd we perform during the #nfl week 4 bloodbath? well we demonstrated manager skill + outperformed the market. detailed  #sportfolio performance report drops tonight.

nonrandomalpha,i like these angles and agree the line seems to inflated but cards down top 2 cbs and lions have a beefed up d this year. well probably keep away...
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is a fascinating approach to understanding coaching/scheme.

does scheme uniqueness predict the first quarter  expected points added  better than neutral scri point   expected points added  for the whole game?"
LeeSharpeNFL,if you think wildcard week is boring (i disagree) i  daily fantasy sports  know why you think adding 2 more games that are likely of worse quality would be better.
LeeSharpeNFL,trubisky. nagy has clearly toned down the playbook most of the year because of trubisky being bad. nagy *might also* be bad this year but the problems start at quarterback.
LeeSharpeNFL,"is it because he goes out to the le free throw  and come back in? or are they defining ""in the pocket"" as only within n yards behind the los?"
LeeSharpeNFL,if you look at public snap count data and focus on plays later in the game from the bdb you should be able to control for this effect i suspect.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i want to know who the jags thought was the team was saying ""well they're gonna give foles $80m for 4 years with $45m guarnateed so we gotta beat that."""
LeeSharpeNFL,maybe if people are measuring in a relative rather than absolute sense. how much better is dak vs. average qbs compared to how much better cmc is than other rbs.
whale_capper,having a tough time making any case for phi beside hfa and dl vs sea ol which didn't materialize l assit week as a differentiating factor... what am i missing?
whale_capper,most talented pass rush but they are facing some tougher ols this season and switch from fangio to pagano at dc might see them take a step back in sacks
whale_capper,the rail bias at churchill downs has been a thing going back to calvin borel in like 2010 how would you incorporate it into the handicap for this years running
AndyMSFW,i would think so but it looks likely to be a trip to kc.  it'd be tough for anyone to keep pace with that offense up against the titans secondary.
AndyMSFW,i see a l overtime of people on the tl n overtime happy with their maryland bets.  just remember it could be worse: you could have bet maryland eastern shore
AndyMSFW,working on it!  but really depending on  years old you are numbers any combo of buf no lac and maybe arz if  it is  gonna go back to +2.5 anyways.

AndyMSFW,true once a guy reaches 11000 aces he usually just stops.  plus he has a pretty bad track record here in miami and on american soil in general.  good luck!
AndyMSFW,patri overtime league update: colgate +110 into the final where i'm guessing they'll be a 4 to 5 point favorite.  lehigh couldn't get there today for the easy money final.

JoeyKnish22,"i had missed the good ole days of  best of luck opening first and dropping bangers. 

hopefully next season linde is doing tv with kiv instead of working at circa."
JoeyKnish22,could be nothing. he might have just been guessing but reggie miller just said on the broadc assit he has a gut feeling zion doesnt play at all this year.
JoeyKnish22,circa really changing the game in so many ways. openers yes/no bets and now comped food if you agree to tail my losing mls bets. place is revolutionizing the industry.
JoeyKnish22,agreed its a horrible set up for him. 3 man booth is too much and hes with 2 traditional broadc assit guys. its just an awkward fit n overtime working.
TheKostos,man listen ill just watch old super bowls if i get upset  (on a serious note yes  years old you are team has kicked my teams ass recently for sure)
TheKostos,we give them out all week  you can easily consume the content you want in podc assit form the next day its all s expected points added rated by topic/sport
TheKostos,watching the nfl spin job about the pass interference review rule. al riveron sucks and should be fired and the league office should be embarrassed by this bullshit mockery sham
TheKostos,i want to despise all houston sports teams forever bc of the cheating scumbag assit ros but i love deshaun watson and im super into what the rockets are doing
TheKostos,man the team that scored 17 in that second game in 2007 must have really sucked. and been qbed by a guy who is nowhere near as good as eli.
LockyLockerson,i would never say 0 percent  but  it is  as close to 0 as you can get.  doesn't mean they aren't good oregon-wisconsin will be a really fun rose bowl.
LockyLockerson,full updated thoughts on all of tonight's nba games now up at the patreon page.  i will be in full sweat mode for a large portion of this evening's proceedings.
LockyLockerson,dal-was: really popular home 'dog for a l overtime of people i follow but just nothing here for me.  opened dal -4.5 now dal -5 i made it dal -4.8.
LockyLockerson,oh yeah you're absolutely right i agree on the context but late in the year i think voters will care much less about context and much more about raw numbers.
LockyLockerson,yeah but like if im home im just eating my food here.  dennys is like 3am and im out and its an impulsive bad decision i regret 2 hours later.
LockyLockerson,i haven't broken it down by week of the preseason yet since obviously every preseason week will behave differently (with starters playing varying amounts) but thought that was worth sharing.
LockyLockerson,if i started watching the aaron hernandez netflix series tonight is this something i'm going to have to watch all of as f assit as possible?  i need sleep tonight.

DannyParkins,this sunday night is my l assit national radio show on cbs sports radio. th against the spread bittersweet but heres more on a little professional news definitely worth celebrating:
DannyParkins,i hadn't seen this number until  story today. the bears have to make a decision on mitch trubisky's 5th year o point ion this off-season. the price tag? $24 million.
DannyParkins,right. because they dont have the personnel to do a traditional running game. kc runs to their receivers all the time. guys n overtime blocking and fumbling is the problem.
DannyParkins,i mean he finished 2nd in the mvp is a back to back all star and an elite defensive player; hes awesome. just all or nothing approach at the plate.
DannyParkins,we had been going 24  minutes at that point i g overtime my point in that it was different and we were late to break. i wasnt changing his mind.
DannyParkins,2 llamas 2 beer donkeys 1 absurd violinist lots of great friends and a wedding that will be tough to top and tougher to explain. what a blast. at colorado
DannyParkins,thanks to everyone  for the opportunity that was a blast.  let us  just agree to n overtime be scott in miami and the sports world will be a better place.
chadmillman,project 256 betting every game continued l assit night with under on vikes-skins (nice work on  by  and  more to come this weekend. n overtime afraid of jinxes! follow along.

Gingfacekillah,"cha point er 8 at page 64. i had to bury the download section in the middle of the book to keep it out of amazon's ""look inside"" website feature."
Gingfacekillah,shannon kelly thorp et al. are well worth the time to read up on. i would also suggest the book fortunes formula for bettors looking for informative yet light reading.
Gingfacekillah,hat tip if like me you were sweating zach lavine u21.5  points  and u29.5 points/rebound/assists. lavine played the l assit 4ish minutes at 21  points  and 29 p/r/a. both cash.

Gingfacekillah,for better or worse mysql database design is the next course for my msc - so  it is  happening. any recommendations for better platforms to look at in the future?
Gingfacekillah,th against the spread exactly what im going for. im very excited to be releasing it soon. just finished my msc data science homework for the week back to writing
Gingfacekillah,it will be released in august earlier if i finish it sooner. i'm going to try and release it ahead of schedule just  daily fantasy sports  want to over promise.
Gingfacekillah,currently working on a hre prop model an exact score mlb add-on to my current baseball model and possibly something for  ho you are k total bases props as well.
Gingfacekillah,a l overtime of modelling seems like being part of an f1 pit crew. build it test it crash it upgrade/r expected points added ir max it out again repeat.
Gingfacekillah,best of luck. notice the tiny under value peeking out here. but like i said  years old you are with percent  will be much higher in the blowout/give up situations.
Gingfacekillah,does anyone else like dal +8.5? it seems like a dumb play on the surface but my admittedly imperfect model has a lean on them largely based on expected tov's.
Gingfacekillah,approx 11.2 possessions le free throw  22.4  points  available would forec assit was to hit 21  points . value would depend on the line price. n overtime a great bet.
logan_matthews9,is all linear regression the same? of course not. theres different ways to input different forms of regression different validation techniques.  moneyline has the same variability (if n overtime moreso)
logan_matthews9,it should be safe - it hasnt even been a year le free throw . but the im pleased comment is ridiculous and shows how out of touch ussf is
logan_matthews9,somebody said to go as a failed gi free throw ed child and  years old you are response is - i was suppose to be a l overtime of things
logan_matthews9,hasnt played consistently. he either needs to catch on at bournemouth or move on. dont think hes epl level but that doesnt mean he couldnt have a role with usmnt
PikachuBets,"i'm n overtime rich and even i wouldn't bother being ""creative"" with any bet 4k and even then i'd need the volume to make all the juice eating worth it"
PikachuBets,"angry  touting for $450
angry  shilling for mybookie
angry  asking "" years old you are guy"" to look into a pitching change cancel for you
more generally angry  being retarded"
PikachuBets,looks like the line is now bkn +8 so my play is +8 now. th against the spread how it works right? you always take the better line when offered?
PikachuBets,yes try to be more impatient pls. you g overtime wooshed here bc what you replied to was 100 percent  a sarcastic comment. lmao at a model being just avg/era
PikachuBets,funniest part about his weeklong obsession with oregon is that they made it. pac-12 champs didn't even need 16 ots to get an at-large lol. bill walton legend status lmao
adamchernoff,well i looked like a dumbass talking up the p against the spread for 5 minutes in this segment from friday. other two bets go this a free throw ernoon.
adamchernoff,ha. still laughing about the story you told about nick thinking the photo of knish was knish. great show as usual. enjoy the holiday weekend guys. merry christmas to all.
adamchernoff,it has been a practice squad since week 10! but the giants redskins raiders and bengals do a great job of making a secondary look much better than it is.
adamchernoff,if everyone betting into the pregame market was aware that half of the game would only have 13 points scored do you think that the total would still be 77?
adamchernoff,in my experience my most profitable fantasy football strategy l is to withdraw all of my money from the fantasy website and then deposit it back into my sportsbook accounts.
adamchernoff,"plenty of questions regarding a #copaamerica2019 preview. ill be joining  and  for a livestream breakdown for  on friday morning (est). 

here are some initial thoughts on two opening round matches:"
adamchernoff,yep reds are a weird team at the moment with a weird mindset. with that said...i would n overtime mind if they scored 5 or more runs specifically this evening.
adamchernoff,surprised you did n overtime make the trip to the beach to cover the long awaited return of union magdalena to the top tier in a thrilling clash with jaguares.
Ccon8181,i do.. otherwise i wouldnt put my $ behind it.. hope it doesnt turn out to be like the over in dallas p against the spread a few weeks ago
Ccon8181,haha  i was trying to find the final score and ppl ke point  posting canisis covered but then the real final came through 5 minutes later. hof by 7 covering
Ccon8181,yes and i pay taxes... notice im n overtime showing all wagers on a game just one slip per game. i could be hitting multiple books ;) ... could be
Ccon8181,shit!! flaming over.. under never had a chance looks like a regular season 230-224 game. no defense and if they miss refs will call foul. wrong side onto the next.
Ccon8181,complete bad reads today... just shit. i was heavy heavy on virginia personally at -5.5 and -6. that loss set me back big time. really tough day at the office.
Ccon8181,disclaimer: #ohiostate had no business covering. but nothing is more #ohiostate then coming all the way back down 20+ late 2nd half and blowing the +4.5 cover in ot. classic..
Ccon8181,#cavs up 11 at half should be more) and #pacers -1 2nd half.. you know what to do. hedge time is the right play but im letting by it ride
Ccon8181,i do but he didnt have his team ready today. poor energy and multiple big time special team miscues -his d expected points added rtment. but wvu was even worse
Ccon8181,one l assit thought.. to the ppl saying you just have to laugh about it- im risking 10k+ a game of real $ - i'm n overtime laughing about shit.
Ccon8181,haha naw they were to assit when they were up 10 and gave up an 80 yard drive and 30 yard  touchdown  with 10 secs le free throw  before half.
Ccon8181,i need to go get a cigar to smoke a free throw er that one! n overtime going to be able to sleep now haha.. time to hit the gym
Ccon8181,some of you subscribed to the free picks but were already on the email list. i can't re-add you. check  years old you are spam or junk folder for email
kellyinvegas,you come to vegas to sign up for one of the contests... we put in  years old you are selections during football season. allows out of state people to participate
kellyinvegas,and i had this convo n overtime too long ago. its been almost 5 years. sorry were n overtime allowed to grow learn and evolve. you guys should try it.
ToddFuhrman,"damn impressive victories during that span; i see why youve already purchased  years old you are tickets for miami

good thing pack can continue to prove me wrong all postseason"
ToddFuhrman,you know we also air the games on fox and you already work for fox...so maybe  could make a call and take care of his co-worker for an appearance on
ToddFuhrman,"no surprise here...

as per  biggest liabilities for today will be the packers and jets; new england becomes a real headache if day games go the way of the players"
ToddFuhrman,we've done the grey cup in the p assit with an assist from  but admittedly so my cfl knowledge isn't up to snuff these days so didn't crack the rotation
ToddFuhrman,ryne...you were n overtime mentioned by name but the c against the spread did make the show which is more than we can say for some other big ten teams
ToddFuhrman,perfect microcosm of their entire season was the 7-6 bowl game.  if they have even an average offense this season they're a legit contender to win the whole damn league
ToddFuhrman,a free throw er acquiring zack greinke from the d-backs the  have become heavy favorites in the al and have surpassed the dodgers for world series favorites at some shops
ToddFuhrman,"we go out for  end of season party and here are the drink choices...explains so much

 - mezcal 
 - beer
me - gin and tonic (save the jokes)
 - milk"
ToddFuhrman,im still n overtime sure if the no liquids travel policy is really for o you are safety or just an excuse to charge travelers $37 for every bottle of
ToddFuhrman,ive never seen payne chug a beer or mixed drink; hes the guy sitting on the veranda sipping his cocktail...very little frat boy in him for better or worse ha

ToddFuhrman,im a sucker for a storyline good redem point ion story for war of will just unfortunately feels like any other race without a triple crown contender or super horse
ToddFuhrman,even as a season ticket holder  daily fantasy sports  give up 4 pp goals and  it is  a mo overtime point... daily fantasy sports  get my blood going clay! ha
ToddFuhrman,when it comes to the titans you're 100 percent  correct but when it comes to the early picks odds can tell you an awful l overtime since money speaks volumes
TheCousinSal,i am spending $73+ on aaron jones next year....provided i dont get kicked out of my fantasy league for pointing out how god-awful the team that won the championship was.
TheCousinSal,i promise i asked  a free throw er writing down my guess. i was just verifying for my thursday fox pre-game selection. bottom line is  is a nosy trouble-making snitch.
TheCousinSal,wilson ramoss 25 game hitting streak is the most underrated story in the history of professional sports. dont at me. we mets fans dont have much to hang onto. #lgm
TheCousinSal,probably n overtime a good thing but at this point zack wheeler has a better sh overtime at winning the  ho you are title than the cy young award. #lgm
TheCousinSal,congr against the spread to all of the adoring ny giants fans.  years old you are teams plans to dra free throw  a qb has been pushed to april 2023.
TheCousinSal,ro overtime ro overtime ro overtime for the home team - if they  daily fantasy sports  win  it is  a rarity.  8 in a row in for mlb playoff hosts.
TheCousinSal,one more own goal to end russias run would be hilarious right now...exce point of course for the soon to be widow of the comrade who gave it up. #worldcup2018russia
TheCousinSal,rusty staub would come to the plate wearing a pair of isotoners choke up a mile and then hit it just as far. he was a joy to watch. #riprusty
12Xpert,but human beings appear to have a wonderful tendency to over bet h overtime teams which implies cold teams might offer some value. see for yourself if  that is  true.
12Xpert,so there is the opportunity to twist things this way and that to suit the argument without actually presenting the actual data that we need to talk about this properly.
12Xpert,"rufus on what's wrong with the tipster model. quite a l overtime actually.

 daily fantasy sports  ever assume ""guaranteed"" means guaranteed in the betting industry.  that is  my $0.02's worth."
12Xpert,i  daily fantasy sports  remember any pro-remainers complaining about the nature of the referendum question before june 2016. i suppose they just thought they wouldn't lose so it didn't matter.
12Xpert,brilliant. lake wobegon effect in full effect.. well over 50 percent  of the sample believe they are at le assit average or above average in that sample. a logical impossibility.
JambosPicks,"all o you are recommendations are time-stamped with the market
line available at bookmaker/betcris. we use the bookmaker line at the time of release to grade o you are recommendations."
mschwimer,i said it was unlikely to happen in the short term. but it certainly could. and we wouldnt want to take proactive steps to help that happen by betting ourselves.
mschwimer,i appreciate you listening with an open mind!  please listen at the 29:30 mark of the podc assit for the exact reason we do n overtime post estimates for bankroll.
mschwimer,most importantly. have i answered everyones questions? are their any other outstanding issues on the ts and cs?  please let me know if i missed anything. always want to improve!
mschwimer,wrong again! please read o you are detailed write up. explains perfectly why we guarantee profitability if only up 1 unit a free throw er paying o you are fee.
mschwimer,you do the math. how likely is it for us to be +242 units over 2769 plays if we have no edge? answer is more than 1 in a million.
mschwimer,58 percent  vs. when we put in the plays. when we put them in o you are subscribers get an automatic email so they know the second we release picks.
mschwimer,absolutely.  plus anyone can review o you are picks at anytime. we post all the necessary information so the twitter world can call us out if we make any mistakes!
mschwimer,agreed completely. its an absolute joke. also the fact that the books cant agree on what to do is worse. at le assit  does things the logical and correct way.
RufusPeabody,cooper ruhh. had to rename him because my code for  college football  2h betting ke point  classifying his pass attem points  as rushes during his time at central michigan.
RufusPeabody,i would be inclined to say he has more skill than someone who only bet a million in a year yes. a l overtime less likely he was lucky.
RufusPeabody,"that was actually a legitimate question. if his method is ""amount invested"" how do you treat that situation? 

but if you want to make up my backstory feel free."
RufusPeabody,really happy with the  episode we just recorded. should drop later today. heavy on  college football  discussion only about 3  minutes spent on dumbos and we get a feisty
RufusPeabody,with 1000 plays (the  minutes amount) that means expectation for a coin flipper would be -45 units. so the guarantee still requires someone to believe jambos has some skill
RufusPeabody,on the pga to you are ever? n overtime an easy way to see -- would have to look through a bunch of google sheets with my sim numbers.
jeffma,i appreciate that my 12 year old nephew has learned the trade you 3 terrible players for 1 really good player trick... but you get 3 players cc:/ #fantasylife
jeffma,n overtime an ignorant question at all. just based on numbers. its probably one of the hardest things to figure out in sports analytics. how to weigh recent performance
jeffma,depends what  years old you are goal is... if you want to lock in a small victory bet a couple hundred on p against the spread moneyline this week
jeffma,really? they had 47 seconds and 3 to's at their own 20... trying to score a  field goal  is n overtime dumb... throwing a bad pass into coverage is...
jeffma,i'm more interested in  years old you are conviction than  years old you are risk aversion based on limited sample size. 1-10 how confident r u in these numbers?
SportsCheetah,improm point u dinner on me tonight at pizzeria mozza ~6:30 for anybody in the los angeles area that wants to sweat usc-iowa points from o you are phones.
SportsCheetah,happy to do that can give o you are sides to rufus or something just  daily fantasy sports  want to publicly put all of them out there for now.
SportsCheetah,bingo  mid-firing this to the corner for an open 3 he sees kp cutting to the hoop and somehow lets off the juice with perfect touch for the lob.
SportsCheetah,you want to lay -3.5 with me? this is the first time all year that i've actually bet against utah so i'm happy to go h2h in this one.
SportsCheetah,took a sh overtime on kings +5.5 +137 in-game because if i learned anything about luke walton  it is  that he will draw up the absolute worst play here.
SportsCheetah,first coaches challenge of the year is on a player elbowing josh hart in the face (and hart went straight up). good luck toronto and enjoy the commercials everybody!
capjack2000,first you need to identify the key numbers. those numbers vary in relation to the spread and total imo.  college basketball  is a very varied sport across all conferences.
capjack2000,dink is all class. _all class_. dink could have named names and thrown entire books under the bus for all the world to see. he took the high road.
capjack2000,nvs se point  handle might beat njs by 9-figures. looking back it should have been obvious when neither rebuck or christie tipped their hand at g2e wrt the numbers.
capjack2000,"example: heres swish analytics (they make prop lines) looking for someone with a bachelors in stem sql experience and knowledge of betting markets. 

willing to pay $50k...in san francisco!"
capjack2000,n overtime surprised to see this coming. every interview i hear with a certain colossus founder mentions their intellectual property when it comes to the idea of cash out.
capjack2000,i think 888 has the potential to change. theyre going to kick out kambi eventually and move linesmaking in-house. then well see how deeply the well has been poisoned.
capjack2000,they have n overtime launched yet. you can sign up for updates at  but just to warn you i signed up long ago and there hasnt been any updates.
capjack2000,8 percent  vig on an in-game bet isn't too egregious imo.  it is  like a 2-way line of -119/-119....which certainly isn't good but n overtime absolutely horrible for in-game.
capjack2000,the latter. on some exchanges the takeout is 1 percent . theres no edge to be had because the big players dominate the markets via h free throw .
dinkinc,nice thoughts jake but most people suck and the president of the unites states says global warming is a hoax and 48 percent  of the country votes for him
dinkinc,keep  years old you are unit variance small.  dont be afraid to n overtime bet pregame and look for a better in game bet .. especially with college games
dinkinc,it took them 25 minutes to decide and now the suspension makes the foul look flagrant. also it occurred in the stretch and involved the leaders.  worst job possible
dinkinc,others have that same opinion too rita .... i  daily fantasy sports  really see it as i have never seen a horse dq'ed from directly behind the fouled horse
dinkinc,it is  fine to be a small better... i rarely bet so i  daily fantasy sports  pay for info since i  daily fantasy sports  have time to process it
robpizzola,he turned the ball over 2x per game this season and i somehow still cashed the season win total over. honestly one of the better bets ive ever made.
robpizzola,ive seen a half dozen that bad this season where they stuck with the call on the field. there is no point in even allowing these to be reviewed.
robpizzola,"1. im n overtime a liberal
2. mayor of toronto used to be leader of the conservative party 
3. premier of ontario is a conservative
4. youre an idiot"
robpizzola,always wondered why they le free throw  the valonqhar prophecy out of the show and i have to assume its because they dont have jamie or tyrion killing cersei.
robpizzola,wouldn't really be able to break anything down. the reality is that i run a bunch of numbers through a simulator for march madness and call it a day.
RASPicks,can't speak to the programming. haven't tuned in enough. but  it is  highly unlikely that the typical listener has any clue if the hosts are winning bettors or not.
RASPicks,it is rare for a play to move that far if it does other groups are in agreement and you  daily fantasy sports  want any part of other side.
RASPicks,i  daily fantasy sports  think you are bad & congr against the spread on success.  it is an industry wide thing to inflate units.  even dr. bob does it.
VegasRefund,should be interesting to see how o free throw en line moves are just fake steam baiting people into chasing thinking a player is out (when they actually arent).
ProfessorShine,so enbiid had to just take that sh overtime even of forced once he gets ball on wing and simmons can try to box out.  what transpired what chaos.
suuma810,wie kommst du zu dem take dass er kein 'spielverstndnis' hat?  hat bspw. erst jngst in seiner analyse herausgearbeitet wie gut er das spiel versteht und gegnerische coverages liest.
suuma810,i didnt say one word about the chiefs offense n overtime being able to score. in fact i believe they will because they also have a very good matchup.
suuma810,with all cornerbacks sidelined the strength of the broncos was their front seven. come out in spread force a light box and take the best matchup - game iced.
suuma810,teams shouldn't pass the ball on every play. they should do what's most efficient as much as they can. that also means running the ball when  it is  +ev.
suuma810,give me sean lee as a dc a guy like lincoln riley as the oc and a smart hc who gives them the full responsibility to run their units.
suuma810,context matters. there are two games with nick foles and without alshon jeffery included in the data. with an improving carson wentz the eagles have +0.3 since week 3.
suuma810,re joe buck: with the legalization of gambling a l overtime of misinformed people in the media and on sports platforms will talk about #betting this season. be aware!
ClevTA,this gm only means something to kc if they assume ne loses to miami at home next week right? maybe they lay off the gas? probably n overtime but
ClevTA,that would be ballsy to take the 1 l team that lost to the other 1 l team for the conference championship. i dont know how that works logically
ClevTA,only way to get in is if multiple teams are 9-7 including browns and bc theyd be 9-4 in conference theyd have a great sh overtime bc of tiebreakers
ClevTA,so funny u say this i was in a group text today and i asked if osu would reach -70 if they played akron at home. -42 first half?
ClevTA,no way man. worst case moore has to go length of the field for a  touchdown . this isnt just to kick a  field goal . apples to oranges
ClevTA,my conversion rate on saying thanks for keeping a door open is 100 percent . u have to be completely oblivious or an asshole to n overtime say anything
ClevTA,but like i said i dont want to be anywhere near that huge line move so i am avoiding the side tonight. may look under 47 -120 if anything
ClevTA,"so tomlin is throwing a challenge flag so he can have 2nd and 10
instead of 1st and 20. huh n overtime sure the payoff is all that great"
CizzlingSports,"and # worst of all time   crying abt the ending of ari but they're n overtime the ""betting public"" nope no way these guy are the legit troo shraps"
CizzlingSports,but what are the odds the guarantee will be paid a free throw er vesting? for spanks odds are good. for the random suckers  i do n overtime know
CizzlingSports,$23m in funding and they only have 50 17 week subs? what do you think the long-play is here?  it is  certainly n overtime selling winning subscri point ions.
CizzlingSports,remember when he sold picks at pregame? here's some fantastic sworn testimony in the pregame v. john karalis lawsuit a free throw er he le free throw  pregame :
CizzlingSports,"lol every time this delusional low-iq gets smoked he claims ""well the public [must have] won"" as if he's just so shrap and contrarian

# worst of all time"
CizzlingSports,"petersen is right there w/hetfield and mustaine as far as riff masters go.

def no disrespect to exodus or overkill and if we're going further back mercyful fate also."
spanky,i dont think there is a one shoe fits all method. the only thing i do believe is if you beat the closing line significantly you will make money.
spanky,"acce point ing a favor from someone gives them a false sense of possible future reciprocation. 

this is human interaction 101.  

best you strictly stick to the analytics ."
spanky,the results of at le assit 1000 non-prop plays - and payment of the guarantee if applicable - will do all the talking on december 31st.  nothing else matters...
spanky,"lets n overtime get too crazy. 

m was taking 40k cf sides on tuesday 830am for saturday games.  

there will never be anything like that in vegas ever again."
spanky,im the exact opposite.  i love the challenge.  i love solving problems.  i love creating things.  i suck at art.  n overtime expected points added d++ is my canvas
spanky,"i did too... joe lupo said in   article that he welcomes sharps.  



sucks to see this go down like this. i thought they were gonna be a game changer..."
spanky,"good stuff.  

i woulda le free throw  the ability to live on a low salary part. then again you g overtime hired so  what the fuck  do i know."
spanky,im n overtime allowed to list the dressmakers (due to spanky name bias) but feel free to check out the videos on my twitter media for more info. #beabookmakernotadressmaker
spanky,happy valentines's day twitter heads.   daily fantasy sports  forget to tell  years old you are first ever valentine how much you love her -  years old you are mother.
spanky,unfortunately standard practice.  many bookmakers both domestic and offshore use confirmation delays as a way to use sharp money to adjust their lines without even writing a bet... #beabookmakernotadressmaker
spanky,i just checked out out .  i know seal tiger and rooster personally for years and guarantee you the ones on his website are n overtime the real guys.
spanky,if you are betting for fun then knock yourself out. my sentiment is based on making a living exclusively betting sports. for me fun is the enemy of discipline.
spanky,you my friend are a very warm and pleasant person.   i enjoyed the ch against the spread we had.   hopefully next time im in town we can have dinner.
spanky,uses their customers to adjust their lines with the spin out.. when mike c ran the joint he wasnt afraid to book a bet.   place fell off big time
DocBettor,different sets of rules on various live betting outs. seems like only bottom right might no action a live team total but unclear. hopefully this red sox game resumes.
PlusEVAnalytics,true but id take the variance in exchange for the pool full of square money which is what this seems to be relative to the other contests out there.
PlusEVAnalytics,poker room just reopened a free throw er over a year closed. ive never seen a room full of poker players where everyone is in such a good mood.
PlusEVAnalytics,growth is an addiction th against the spread eventually going to destroy us. i cringe every time i hear the word (which is very very o free throw en).
PlusEVAnalytics,the priors are selected judgementally. the best thing to do is select a few different sets of priors and calculate a posterior from each to get a reasonable range.
PlusEVAnalytics,when i smoke my recreational cannabis i dont do it with any expectation of any health benefit. i think recreational gamblers still have some expectation or hope of winning...
PlusEVAnalytics,no. next season as in 2020 if 2019 results are good. if 2019 results are bad we forget this conversation ever happened. th against the spread how this works.
PlusEVAnalytics,is this ever cowardly. i guess never again means never again will it happen to us. you mfers on the other hand are on  years old you are own.
PlusEVAnalytics,long sh overtime but if anyone wants to golf on friday at  im booked as a single at 10:30 come join me (or show up and kneecap me whatev)
PlusEVAnalytics,per this chain of logic it would be sacrilegious to punish a woman for having an abortion because god made her do it and youd be disrespecting gods will?
PlusEVAnalytics,this should be called probabilistic the free throw  - it has a large impact in extremely rare situations such that its easily to be blind to it a priori.
aluckyaday,daily fantasy sports  like mince pies. sacrilege i know. but the whole conce point  of gambling clashes with the christian ethic. too much hypocrisy in this campaign for me.
aluckyaday,closely followed by getting cross validation and testing correct. the  moneyline algorithm in the middle is n overtime so relevant. remember regression is just another machine learning algorithm .
aluckyaday,its funny. he does n overtime even realise the record he is boasting about is n overtime that great. 1 in 74 monkeys picking at random would beat it.
aluckyaday,and we finally have a winner. n overtime going to get my 1 in a million event n overtime today anyway. next runner may be the start of it!
aluckyaday,"i guess it depends where in the settlement code palp checks are done. it would n overtime surprise me though if the code was 

if returns  0 then checkpalps"
aluckyaday,the issue is all streaming is subject to a delay. as you scale up the delay increases. facetiming to a few is very different to streaming live to millions.
aluckyaday,harder or easier for pros to get bets down since the change? do american pros tend to bet with traditional american sportsbooks in vegas or was/is it mainly offshore?
theFirmAISports,"picks with probability of success:

joeytunes2,its beating a dead horse with these books. they just dont want to book. they want to turn it into casino games. were they hold edges on everyone period.
joeyisaks,well th against the spread even worse the teams that have value teasing today are lions texans falcons .. just google wong teasers and dont do any diff kind
joeyisaks,theres many theories that suggest dating sites base  years old you are matches/ their algorithms to get you dates but n overtime relationships so u stay a paying member
joeyisaks,impressive to go from a sensical rant to begging for accounts. i wish i had the balls to beg random twitter strangers for accojnts but n overtime there yet
joeyisaks,if this game was the final scene of a football movie i touchdown  seem too fake . a qb just came in that has feeling only in one foot
EdMillerPoker,"people misunderstand the difference between lifespan and healthspan.

lifespan means living long enough to see everyone you care about die.

healthspan means remaining fit enough to dig their graves."
EdMillerPoker,"add onto that compliance in a zillion different jurisdictions ma/legacy operations to update and so on.

how you want it to work is just very hard to actually realize."
EdMillerPoker,yeah this is a big problem imo with the current live products. the reason they take it down is because they can't make the lines in the 4th quarter
EdMillerPoker,lol this is my kneejerk also to all these folks who have life all figured out and want to tell you what theyre doing right and youre doing wrong
EdMillerPoker,the mistakes are very large in size at the moment and you can catch them just thru comparison. agree that the modeling is tricky esp for football and baseball.
EdMillerPoker,"i always appreciate anyone who takes the time to legit review my books on amazon whether they liked them or not...

having said that the feedback is sometimes... interesting..."
EdMillerPoker,obv. a self-published book is the highest form of human expression due to the direct connection with  years old you are audience and the high margins and infinite scale
EdMillerPoker,what the fuck  its still on there and yet n overtime only did i see  years old you are tweet but twitter saw fit to notify me of it
EdMillerPoker,operators know the market pricing isn't good enough to offer it full-on to customers so they deal it very defensively--low limits delays lots of bet rejections etc. for example...
EdMillerPoker,well imo they would and should do most of it in house but a few key bits they would be wise to get by acquiring specialized 3rd party vendors
GolcondaFund,"i do n overtime care  years old you are political opinions.

from an honest handicapper's perspective if you trust trump during a time like this can i 'borrow' 100k?"
GolcondaFund,"imagine if ab just sucked it up and played for the raiders. may have made playoffs 40 million and on his way to a sunset career in vegas.
#raiders"
GolcondaFund,somehow playing in that division and getting the dolphins and jets cowboys g overtime worse since l assit year. dear god get rid of jason garrett 5 years ago.
GolcondaFund,missed this! but was on both...sadly this season's continued fade of balt is looking dumber by the minute. too well coached players too bought in to fade so vehemently.
GolcondaFund,i switched from iphone to note 5 can i get a free upgrade since i was sharp enough to be ahead of the curve? asking for a...well me. ;)
GolcondaFund,actually would be most successful assigning a digit to each player rather than a name. #37853 retired. ah and #37584 replaces him. moderate downgrade market overreacts buy buy buy.
GolcondaFund,"jackson...one trick pony
agholor......one year wonder
alshon injury prone...
previous results is n overtime predictive of future success. 
loving the eagles hype this year though. good time to sell."
nonrandomalpha,th against the spread like saying wait til we discover cds or dvds or newspapers. in a digital world we prefer the medium that doesnt exist in physical form.
nonrandomalpha,why many so-called sharp sports bettors are wrong about the #browns.  bet this team over 9 wins at +105 or better. 1 percent  long term position to yield 105bps.
nonrandomalpha,would love to hear  years old you are take on o you are approach to 'touting': building model portfolios across 3 different risk appetites which includes baked-in bankroll management...
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  think 1 year is an awful sample to train the model on but analyses can just look at 2012 forward if  that is  the concern.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm missing the second half of this game to go to an event with my partner and of all games to miss i may have picked a good one.
LeeSharpeNFL,"going into sunday night football here is my model's bye probabilities for the nfc:

no: 67 percent 
sea: 55 percent 
sf: 44 percent 
gb: 29 percent 
min: 6 percent"
LeeSharpeNFL,doesn't apply only to careers but agree with the overall sentiment. i've found i'm more likely to regret n overtime having done something than i am having done something.
LeeSharpeNFL,how many coaches would have the conviction to keep going for it on 4th down when they are n overtime working out? kyle shanahan and john harbaugh are great.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm n overtime sure exactly what you/they mean but from the sounds of it it doesn't sound like it does a very good job of well moving the sticks.
LeeSharpeNFL,this was counter-intuitive to me but according to my model the outcome of  sunday night football  has very little effect on whether the seahawks get the bye or not.
LeeSharpeNFL,"colts now tied with the texans at 6-4 and lead the afc south by winning the first game between them as the tiebreaker.

the second game is thursday night."
LeeSharpeNFL,the season version takes a long time. if you check my pinned tweet i have code for scraping a single game by id that may work better for you.
whale_capper,oh for sure i'm just joking calling back to yesterday when fox tortured some of us who needed to see cut drama unfold live but were fed gm instead
whale_capper,also hoping por makes adjustments to take away the orebs and we know neither team likes to run sprinkle a little fatigue and elevation and  it is  a beauty
whale_capper,fair point to qualify i see them hitting the 4-seed and i dont expect them to be able to win b2b road games to make the sb this year
AndyMSFW,seems a fitting adjective... i finished it in the oven and made too much glaze so i put layers on early and o free throw en.  many many layers.
AndyMSFW,even if they fall short the fact that the raiders are still in the playoff hunt and have outlasted pre-season darlings like lac cle  chi is pretty fun. #blackhole4ever
AndyMSFW,i still  daily fantasy sports  know what happened there.  either that kid from memphis transferred to jackson state today or a couple of portland's players are lost at sea...
AndyMSFW,be touchdown si and 5dimes are the only ones i know of.  that said 5dimes shades some lines to keep you from using certain + expected value teaser strategies.
AndyMSFW,"already posted a couple including a total and a teaser for week 1.  you can follow me on the app my username is just ""andy"" pretty easy to find."
AndyMSFW,he's a good putter i guess i'm banking on it n overtime regressing too much while the other pieces of his game catch up a bit over the weekend.
AndyMSFW,"kuuuuuuchhh
yeah no one likes him but if i took outrights on the nicest guys on to you are i'd just have a bunch of losing tom hoge tickets."
AndyMSFW,"as we talked about on the tuesday  i've sprankled some small bets on women's world cup futures:
usa +300 (0.6x)
germany +605 (0.4x)
dutch +1400 (0.25x)
aussies +1800 (0.25x)"
AndyMSFW,wrote down my thoughts about how the conference tourney project went how to make it better in 2020 and what i'll be up to for the next few weeks:
JoeyKnish22,the bovada live betting so free throw ware taking $25-$50 max on live nba totals while at the same time/same game taking $500-$750 on the side is....odd i guess.
JoeyKnish22,i thought harbaugh was personally some disagreed. i dont see mcdermott winning unless he be against the spread the p against the spread next week and wins the division.
JoeyKnish22,do you have a screenshot? i know a l overtime of ppl that had a burrow bet there (including myself) and they were all graded a winner no issues.
JoeyKnish22,"if you havent lost enough money betting canadian soccer with me this year. 

i took canada +0.5 in the nations league tonight vs the usmnt and sprinkled the ml."
JoeyKnish22,i feel like i would need to mix 3 red bulls with some crystal meth to get to this level for 7 minutes. the #kostoscoaster is a wild ride.
JoeyKnish22,you know tickets are in high demand when you replace half the lower bowl of all the premium se against the spread with an em point y grass hill.
JoeyKnish22,if they were im sure  would have me on pirate masc overtime futures and hed get knocked the fuck out first round by like the stupid stanford pine tree.
JoeyKnish22,i couldnt have been more wrong on the hockenson pick. n overtime trying to overreact to one game. but hes probably like the 8th best te in the league.
JoeyKnish22,if hes truly a regular/main fixture in starting 11 in an attacking position (assuming this is the case especially cause of what they paid for him) over. easy over.
JoeyKnish22,g overtime a peep of the new  ui from buddy north of the border looks fresh af. much needed improvement to the interface. hopefully rolls out smooth/functions well .
JoeyKnish22,algeria gonna win this game with one sh overtime attem point  that deflected 60 feet in the air hit the roof and went in as the goalie never moved.
JoeyKnish22,if you look close enough you can see the ball hit my wallet when it drops in the net and what little money was le free throw  is gone.
TheKostos,"""shallow"" has to be the  karaoke song right now. unreal duet and  it is  easy for both guy and girl to sing and  it is  a dope ass song"
TheKostos,awesome  hitting  years old you are inboxes soon.  and i chopped up the nfl card cfp bowl games and a little nba.  and  joined. lots of laughs. great shit.
TheKostos,"as we stand on the precipice of a week 11 nfl sunday i nick kostos am wishing you:

minimal sweats

winning bets

and the absolute very best of luck."
TheKostos,breaking: boom boom has informed me that the 1 (nadal) at the rebel at oaklawn tomorrow is a play. grunt like youre rafa when you place the bet.  #boomboom
TheKostos,"1-1 tonight with hornets +10 cashing and rockets +1 being one of the worst bets i've placed in oh a few days or so.

have sixers +5.5 pending. #nbanick"
TheKostos,"#nbanick's pick tonight:

hornets +1.5

and i've g overtime another and  it is   best bet of the night.

he'll give it in the 6pm ho you are tonight  with"
TheKostos,i just saw that big ben throwing video good god when was the l assit time that dude hit a treadmill or did some cardio???? he's fucking huge lol
TheKostos,very cool words from svp about o you are guy  who has been crushing since we started ybyb and is very much worth a follow if you aren't already
TheKostos,god please let it come to light that those cheating scumbag assit ros were really wearing devices inside their jerseys that would buzz. please. i dont ask for much.
TheKostos,a free throw er eating peaquods i rescind my comment that chicago deep dish pizza is trash. n overtime as good as ny of course but very very good.
TheKostos,i think  it is  more likely we'll need rozelle and george young to come back to life and mimic what happened in the early 80s before parcells. fun times!
LockyLockerson,very busy night in the nba most of the league in action.  my a free throw ernoon updated thoughts on all the games now up at the patreon page!
LockyLockerson,the best part is im pushing this narrative despite the fact i think georgia be against the spread lsu which makes this entire exercise pointless.  just stirring the pot!
LockyLockerson,kinda boring nba day so posted the a free throw ernoon thoughts a little early on patreon.  can update if some kind of crazy unexpected player news occurs later.
LockyLockerson,nba overnight projections and analysis for wednesday now up at patreon.  college was all over the place but my nba bets went 2-0 tonight!  wuv you bulls and nuggets.
LockyLockerson,two teams were playing a true road game saturday a free throw er 5(!) consecutive home games: wisconsin and missouri. they were both 3+ touchdown favorites and lost outright.
LockyLockerson,"i think there's a little uncertainty with how michigan will play tempo-wise even though  it is  looked a little ""same-old"" at times.  total will be very low though yes."
LockyLockerson,oh youre good i really may have been off by one but fortunately for us the totals are always in such a tight range it doesnt matter most weeks
LockyLockerson,the good news is you can now get him on many platforms without danny.  one of the truly great break-ups in history for the benefit of us the listener.
LockyLockerson,"n overtime to wreck the ""inside info"" narrative here but i bet the limit on ny at -130 l assit night and i have absolutely no inside information whatsoever."
LockyLockerson,"college basketball and nba overnight projections up over at patreon...but most importantly...

nhl first-period betting season returns tomorrow!  spreadsheet will be up mid-day.  what a time to be alive."
EliHershkovich,"despite 64 percent  of the bets on the warriors (via  sharp money's shi free throw ed ra point ors -1.5 to -2.

DannyParkins,had him. started him. in an absolute barn burner against a guy who has cmc-sanders-mixon all playing. i also have zeke. a matchup worthy of the playoff semis. #youcare
DannyParkins,"wait... i missed this postgame. really?! then how do you n overtime kneel towards his preferred hash? or obviously run it towards his preferred hash?! 

this keeps getting worse."
DannyParkins,nagy was the bigger problem in the 1st half. mitch was a disaster in the 2nd half and continues to be the far bigger problem overall. what a disaster.
DannyParkins,still rolling talking all the games but my man  was offended he hadnt been on my gambling show yet so hes joining the party at 10:30 am et... gambling!
DannyParkins,its within the realm of possibility that the bears are the best team in the nfl and its always possible the quarterback of the leagues best team wins mvp.
DannyParkins,i am willing to exclusively report that sweeping the cardinals is way better than getting swe point  by the cardinals as a #cubs fan.  daily fantasy sports  at me.
DannyParkins,when the broadc assits talks about hopefully this stops the chatter that the warriors are better without kevin durant i wonder who theyre talking about. no one believes this.
DannyParkins,come on out tonight and ill buy ya a beer and we can discuss how much of a monster i am for bringing a sign to a baseball game
DannyParkins,one of the best pieces of sportswriting i've ever read is wright thompson on ichiro. carve out some time today if you want a greater understanding of the legend.
chadmillman,"we do as much ""teach-them-how-to-fish"" betting content as possible. but on sunday morning what's  years old you are request? ""just tell me who the f percent $ to bet!"""
chadmillman,a special day in which we are making all of o you are content free. in honor of pat mahomes i'd make this offer with ketchup if i could.

chadmillman,tb buf mia pit: short home dogs (tb opened as dog closed as small fave). public anti all 4; all won. scenario o free throw  discussed w/scooch on pod
Gingfacekillah,definitely the writing style is....er...strained. i didn't use anything in the book for horse racing but found transferable applications for some of the excel based ideas to other sports.
Gingfacekillah,i didn't think the season was going to be like this but i agree with you. this is the easier portion of the schedule. i think we've seen enough.
Gingfacekillah,my understanding isnt that strong but i thought that was the whole point of data partitioning with a train and test set: to avoid overfitting and data mining error.
Gingfacekillah,thank you for this.  it is  been a pet theory of mine that exploitable inefficiencies might exist at the game level even if the the aggregate is highly efficient.
PikachuBets,"""get closing line value they said"" they said

"" that is  the key to winning"" they said

PikachuBets,lmao wow this guy really wrote this and thought i touchdown  be a great idea to make it well-known that the market regularly fades his groups shitty fucking plays

adamchernoff,rams handicap for  monday night football  was published on the thursday morning episode of the show. no market rundown so its an 11 minute look at the game below:
adamchernoff,slow and subtle. use them to answer a question and based st against the spread around that question.  daily fantasy sports  try to cover all categories in one ranking.
adamchernoff,yep. looked like culver gathered to go up for a block too. jerome completely sucked him in on the sell. hope all is good  years old you are way.
adamchernoff,"big matchup in #ligabancomermx  tonight as leaders  host  

my weekly preview for  breaks down the betting market for you and looks at the potential for an upset. 

read below"
adamchernoff,"entering the halfway point of the #ligabancomermx  schedule  are atop the table. is there position warranted or are  being undervalued?

my latest for  looks at the big matchup tomorrow"
adamchernoff,no disagreements there. but as someone that works and lives in the industry it drives me insane that this is the bar that has been set. its a joke.
adamchernoff,"thanks michael appreciate that. thanks for taking the time to read. 

youre right on that! shame they conceded the late  field goal  try instead of pushing for a win."
Ccon8181,"back to work.. ill get this out now as line is coming down in some spots

#tcu +2.5 negative expected value 

#bayvstcu # college football  # college football picks"
Ccon8181,0 awareness... that was done of the stupidest shit ive seen. up there with creighton throwing the ball outta bounds up 3 with .5 seconds le free throw .
Ccon8181,big time n overtime even close. best home court record coming off an overtime loss to a team off a 7 game series no rest and they played down/quit
Ccon8181,one l assit time back to the #nevspit game. i can go back 7-19 years. ive never had a 2 point  conversion go my way. its unreal.0-15 and counting
Ccon8181,so if the cops show up at  years old you are house and tell you to leave bc the price increased and the developer wants it back you leave?
Ccon8181,anyone that sells a 3 percent  or greater edge in preseason nfl is delusional. let us  clean house this year and promote those that do it the right way
kellyinvegas,at this point yes. again these were picked weeks in advance. th against the spread the issues with betting early....firings suspensions etc can all effect the line and motivation.
kellyinvegas,i made kstate a 3 point dog. th against the spread what they opened at circa. so i stayed away. thought about betting them at 5.5 but just couldnt.
kellyinvegas,if you want to make $ just bet against  in the first half. its nuts how much they dont care until the l assit 5  minutes of the game.
kellyinvegas,really  can tell you th against the spread n overtime the truth. and having minty help with the proxy service has what to do with wager talk? im confused.
ToddFuhrman,there isn't a more punitive or game altering penalty in any sport than issuing a pk in soccer when  it is  n overtime a clear and obvious scoring chance
ToddFuhrman,years old you are boss is a smart man (although i see no correlation either) but id be happy to send him my resume for additional part time work
ToddFuhrman,"rare massive pros vs joes divide on thursday night football

little to say handicap much different taking denver +3 (-120) compared to where the market opened on the dog..."
ToddFuhrman,thanks man and for as much as we give  a hard time for me personally n overtime having a dog in the fight hopefully the raps pull it off
ToddFuhrman,im watching these games in jersey and have zero clue how people can watch anything on the west co assit and get to work on time the next morning
ToddFuhrman,all about the build but no doubt a challenge to recreate a new rivalry on the same level of bobby and chuck a free throw er they joined forces
ToddFuhrman,ha all about the grind...have to work twice as hard this time of year to keep up with the  college basketball  diehards in order to find a few w's
ToddFuhrman,mkes two of us...think its stay away territory or maybe take a sh overtime on a few bombers since i believe were going to see a few big wrecks
TheCousinSal,wow - i dont know how any official let alone one assigned to a game of this magnitude misses a pass interference call like that.  # college football playoff
TheCousinSal,why why why would freddie kitchens (hue part 2) think he would win a pass interference/pick play challenge against belicheat? irony such as that doesnt exist in the nfl.
TheCousinSal,sure weve all used a fake penis to pass a drug test before participating in the olympics but  experience with this tactic is pretty special. (interview begins at 1:00:35)
TheCousinSal,another bad beat for me on  with my fuhrman/lopez under best bet.  wins the week again betting twelve dollars on soccer games no one gives a crap about. #howlonguntilfootballseason
TheCousinSal,if youre in fort worth come say hi to me and the degenerate trifecta at the   if youre out of town - come visit anyway. flights are really cheap.
TheCousinSal,this is going to be tough to pull off roger. you should probably  hire the guy who hid the ray rice tapes from you to enforce these caveats. #phony
TheCousinSal,my lock of the ncaa round of 64 my pick to win it all ...and a terrible dick vitale impression all in one 2 minute 13 second video! #gambling
TheCousinSal,we took a vote to see if the gang wanted to bet on english premier darts and only i was in favor so  will return on monday. stay safe!
12Xpert,a drink is a drink regardless of whether a billionaire or a minimum wagerer drinks it. a 1 percent  stake is n overtime the same for these two people.
12Xpert,remind me: how many matches had it been since #arsenal lost at home a free throw er leading at half time? illustrates  the scale of the problem facing #arteta
12Xpert,that is true but on average i suspect you have + expected value otherwise these so free throw  books wouldn't be offering such loss leaders to attract new customers.
12Xpert,if  years old you are expected long term yield is +10 percent  this is what things look like. still a 1 in 7 chance of having made a loss.
12Xpert,and we hold referendums for such things here like changing the voting system. by default eu treaty changes are of constitutional importance so nations should hold referendums on them.
12Xpert,ok to my knowledge i never published the file of match results on the website. perhaps you are confusing it with the wisdom of crowds results which is available.
12Xpert,google are good at search algorithms i'm guessing n overtime so much at beating a betting market. i imagine that like for fivethirtyeight these things are just page filler.
12Xpert,i think they are fair when  years old you are traders wont reveal to restricted customers why they have been restricted and wont reveal whether that is company policy.

RufusPeabody,yep though its debatable that with the new xp distance and more 2- point  attem points  whether those are worth it. id have to look at my chart
RufusPeabody,btw another example of how the ravens are a smart organization they have a backup qb in rg3 with a similar (but inferior) skill set to their starter.
RufusPeabody,you bet a team -3 -105 (w/ -115 comeback) at a market-making book. that game closes -3 -110/-110 at the same book. would you consider this positive clv?
RufusPeabody,. hands a backpack full of $150000 in cash to a reporter. what could possibly go wrong?  fantastic article by  shedding light on the new sports betting landscape.
RufusPeabody,do i think having 300 entries instead of 150 in a 100k entry contest provides a *massive* advantage? no. but obviously i do get why people are upset.
jeffma,we have talked about bankroll management and kelly but can talk about it more if you think guys think  it is  a worthwhile conversation... maybe even this week
SportsCheetah,kentucky +250 probably the nuts here a free throw er vt had 3 chances to end it a free throw er getting gi free throw s and whiffed.
SportsCheetah,i mean i have nothing to say if you think theyre a legitimate contender at this point and dont need to do anything different to try and improve.
SportsCheetah,probably n overtime anymore at that price was 50/1 range earlier on in the year. i bet most improved player at 25/1 so rooting that one home hopefully.
SportsCheetah,kcp just made fo you are straight midrange jumpers as many makes as he had total in his first three games. he's g overtime o you are backs.
SportsCheetah,oh wow haha that was just the game i remember having to pull up on my phone to watch the ending  that is  pretty funny. degenerates everywhere unite.
capjack2000,by explain i mean that you have a paycheck from  years old you are s-corp which helps get loans and verify income. those situations are always a pain.
capjack2000,"where the income is made. technically you would need to file a state tax income return for each of those states. 

(n overtime a cpa)
(but i'm right)"
capjack2000,really guys my golf game is pretty bad unless there are windmills involved. besides i suspect mr. peabody is hard at work in the laboratory until late january.
capjack2000,they dont have an obligation to facilitate no more than board cleaners have an obligation to n overtime bet into arbitrage situations they encounter. its just market efficiency.
capjack2000,"this is the best thing youll read today. tremendously well-written profile of  and the new world of legal sports betting. 

congratulations  on a landmark article for this industry."
capjack2000,tilman fertitta owner of golden nugget owns the houston rockets. nv allows him to book all but hou games while nj doesn't permit any nba at his book.
capjack2000,"a shared uber with a mother  daughter who talked about how they were worried they couldn't make ends meet....

...as they all shared a ride to a casino."
capjack2000,shouldn't affect  years old you are ability to cash out.  that is n overtime a geo-restricted action. you can do  years old you are account banking from anywhere.
capjack2000,much more devastating in a locals market like pennsylvania where $200m is lost each month in machines (they  daily fantasy sports  break it down to sl overtime denominations).
dinkinc,so much for the raiders have to win their l assit game ever blah blah blah.... crap teams can lose to anyone...be a gambler ...n overtime a shrink
dinkinc,you tweeted about bringing a new friend to her first show at bar as it also was  years old you are first show... did she like it ?
dinkinc,o you are president is so dumb...... how dumb is he ?...... he brought a gun to the golf course because he wanted to sho overtime a birdie
dinkinc,a first in my 40+ year betting career ... i have action on martinique.... n overtime too many ufirsts for me... go martin  daily fantasy sports  be ique
dinkinc,he can name about 500 pay per heads and tell you who they copy. he could care less about watching a game.  he does occasionally check for scores
dinkinc,jesus alan you are fighting with someone who has the same opinions you do and when someone [me] pointed this out you  went out and made it worse
dinkinc,i was hoping for a peaceful week but ill take it one day at a time.  good luck with  years old you are new career path.  very noble.
robpizzola,i dont know what vic fangio did with the vic fangio that was kicking moronic field goals l assit week but we need more of this vic fangio.
robpizzola,n overtime really tbh. i love hammett as much as anyone else but his chops are much worse. cant even play the real solo to blackened live anymore.
RASPicks,there is no doubt that a betting partner model is far superior to selling picks but to say it holds the high moral ground i can't get behind.
RASPicks,since 2012 +1.05 units on fcs plays and +37.5 units on non-fcs plays.  also you have o point ion of o point ing out of any play type.
RASPicks,47 lined college basketball games friday.  391 over next 14 days.  it is like cramming 8  college football  saturday's in to a two week span. #whywestop college football

ProfessorShine,wg and spoint are much better books than anything stateside right now but both sportsbook directors admit they look to large offshores to be aligned with the market.
ProfessorShine,darren also has to weigh clicks which leads to potential followers\subscribers.  im at a loss how journalist can also be a salesman. seems like a conflict of interest.
ProfessorShine,id like to think a radio person can be interesting without being totally fluff narrative.  but theres a market for marshall apparently.  he has gold sheets to sell
suuma810,and the reason they increased their rushing rate was because they were winning more games than during weeks 1-9  they were a pass heavy team early in games.
suuma810,kyle shanahan bombed the saints le free throw  and right on the first drive and now he runs on 2nd  14. its the stuff that drives me crazy.
suuma810,i'm n overtime saying they are world-beaters. but they were an 8-8 team are better on paper this year and won't face andrew luck (0-2 l assit year).
suuma810,betting markets are attacking under 10.5 wins for the #chiefs. i agree: they need to overcome offensive regression with a not-so-much improved defense. check out my team preview:
suuma810,the #jets are giving antonio brown money to an off-ball lb who isn't known for elite coverage ability. and matt paradis is still a free agent. just wow.
suuma810,lets go: welche oliner kmen an 3 fr die jets infrage? der einzige der mir bis jetzt o free throw  vor die augen gefallen ist - jonah williams.
suuma810,the number we are allowed to see is the spread and it moved from -5 to -6 and then -6.5 yesterday with more chicago money hitting the market.
suuma810,counter iv: eagles lost su vs boys who were coming off a short week and have barely beaten the giants and the redskins with mccoy/sanchez in the meantime.
suuma810,"i think we should move on from ""defense wins championships"". you won't win a playoff game against the chiefs by playing good defense. their offense dictates the game."
ClevTA,years old you are i told u sos are at an all time high this weekend. are u doing this in the middle of backstreet boys karaoke again?
ClevTA,no chance?? n overtime likely is a better term but n overtime no chance. they are already sitting at 4 so they apparently havent been dinged that much
ClevTA,some hal free throw ime reading. nfl against the spread  picks. at this point my thursday night picks are probably the only ones worth paying attention to apparently
ClevTA,if u can find anthony miller first  touchdown  14-1 in the early gm th against the spread a decent one if u want a fun prop before turkey
ClevTA,yup. i was on eagles that game too. allen being mobile too i think helps with a windy game so hes n overtime stuck throwing in the pocket.
ClevTA,remember the name? u are like 3  years too late. hey  we were putting bam in o you are  daily fantasy sports  lineups in 2017 i believe lol
ClevTA,having fun buddy. i recall an ambush of u  my tweets about the browns a few weeks ago so i will have my eye on u dont worry
ClevTA,bills g overtime the ball right back a free throw er the 4th down missed. does  years old you are calculator say going for it wasnt worth it?
ClevTA,imagine looking at the preseason vegas win totals and deciding that ever putting those two teams on primetime this year was smart. i  daily fantasy sports  get it
ClevTA,new mexico might be the bad beat of the year if they score v hawaii here. trying to score 28  points  in the final 7m of the game
ClevTA,agreed. also bc their young guys are unselfish and play defense which is a rare combo. pelicans and pacers will be two of my fav league pass teams
ClevTA,wh against the spread worse is i could understand somewhat of using more 11 if u have huggins but without him why are u forcing someone like ratley?
ClevTA,u ready for the full t f monken experience tonight? hopefully we wont see a single pass attem point  under 20 yards or a run on first down
CizzlingSports,"seems like # worst of all time  was gonna try to add a free with on uf to his  college football  record lol

 i do n overtime know"
CizzlingSports,"lol good point - no picks yet this week

getting slaughtered to the tune of -40 units l assit 3 seasons might have something to do with this?"
CizzlingSports,"i do n overtime know  maybe the point is that  and  are flexing over a ""blood bank guarantee"" play only available in pa/nj which had a micro limit."
CizzlingSports,unfortunately it seems like a free throw er 2 years of making the picks public he might be keeping 2019 behind a paywall to avoid monitoring or tracking
CizzlingSports,lmao # worst of all time   blocking out risk amounts in march like he didn't already show in november that he bets $10 whole dollars on these futures
spanky,"thanks! i really enjoyed the question/answer format.  ill post a similar thread before future  tapings.

im having a good time doing it.

thanks to you and everyones support!"
spanky,we are at a point where the market liquidity is n overtime high enough to satisfy o you are appetite so we are usually just max betting everything...
spanky,why would i do that. so people can like me more and i can get more followers?  im n overtime seeking anyones approval.  i bet. i dont sell.
spanky,i dont sell. i extract money from bookmakers n overtime my fellow bettors. without betting partners id be out of business. very few bookmakers worldwide book me directly
spanky,"if its 100 for him it will eventually be 100 for me.... 

taking a 100 max on a college football total earns them the title of dressmaker 

#beabookmakernotadressmaker"
spanky,i agree on a practical level but this would make for very boring radio that would get old a free throw er one episode.   does his thing well.
spanky,i was given 2500 on  college basketball  sides and 1300 on  college basketball  totals.... 300/game is n overtime worth my time to stand there and bet all day
spanky,perfect resizing assume games dont run concurrently.... thanks for  years old you are input.  youre a sharp cat. if  you are ever in ny/nj area hit me up...
spanky,there are still a handful of joints that make me call in. one joint in particular has had the same clerks since i stared about 20 years ago.
spanky,that is  a great question for the touts to answer.  my guess would be a benefit from the economies of scale with added income without much more work.
DocBettor,wow why didnt anyone tell me about this sooner? i just lost $6k at the tables between l assit night and this morning there goes my tuition money
DocBettor,i card count almost exclusively in brick and mortar casinos. i was just pointing out that there are + expected value opportunities online too though they're extremely rare.
PlusEVAnalytics,only somewhat related to  years old you are question but is it generally a fixed conversion between spread and ml? do all nba +7s get the same ml?
PlusEVAnalytics,leafs playing on black friday in buffalo was an a+ scheduling move. half of my friends are cross border shopping today (so yeah like 2 out of 4!)

PlusEVAnalytics,the city you currently live in is gridlocked due to a snow storm. th against the spread a pretty cruel thing to wish for the people you love.
PlusEVAnalytics,i just checked their faq and true to his word there is a letter from capital one dated nov 6 2019. so credit where credit is due  .
PlusEVAnalytics,"dad look around. do you notice that rainbow flag everywhere?  years old you are shirt says youre a proud gay american

PlusEVAnalytics,lets define as something th against the spread n overtime priced into the futures markets. nebulous definition i know but th against the spread how life is sometimes...
PlusEVAnalytics,hey i dont love magic the gathering either but lets n overtime throw slurs around seth is a nice guy and he doesnt deserve that kind of treatment
PlusEVAnalytics,how long have you been buying from whom for how much and what is  years old you are betting record? only if you are willing to share. thanks!
PlusEVAnalytics,yes the lines are super sharp now. derivative markets (props halves etc) are the best opportunity for people who dont want to devote their entire lives to this.
PlusEVAnalytics,youre missing the point. let x be some data element or combination of data elements. i find a predictive relationship between x and over/under. you wont see it.
PlusEVAnalytics,what are these  daily fantasy sports  sites supposed to do make you sign an nda when you submit  years old you are lineups? the whole thing is absurd.
aluckyaday,where are you getting the raw data from? how are you reversing any bias correction the polling companies have already done before applying  years old you are own?
aluckyaday,2. the cost of sharp information has gone up. why would sharps bet with you at -110 in a regulated market when they can bet at -105 elsewhere?
aluckyaday,2-2 need to have a word with the computer never back the giants! season now 10-5-1 (started week 2) mean revision kicking in now only 66 percent .
aluckyaday,what do the bookies know? cut aus a free throw er the performance now pushing them out 11/1 with lads. very suspicious do they have a vote mole?
joeytunes2,"some 7 year old at my sons wrestling. said ""eagles 27-23""  ""i said  years old you are dead on the total"". do you have a fan duel acct?"
joeytunes2,ed did you get my application for overnight janitor? lmk i'm n overtime gonna steal all  years old you are info at 3am for 6 dollars and hr.
joeytunes2,u kidding me  they cut to harper live and n overtime judge.  they act like this guy is babe ruth. lol so free throw  ground out to first.
joeytunes2,dude i was at his craps table when i was like 23. i was hammered. saying whoaaaa! a free throw er every toss. he couldn't stomach me. haha
joeytunes2,nothing special just a opinion. i figured gordon would play. it moved pretty well when he was out 2 days ago. and there a different team without him.
joeyisaks,if you want to go the route of protecting problem gambling than i think locals do the best job of this def n overtime legal on this one
joeyisaks,wow monte carlo wont refund my ticketz  to tournament even to a usa patron like me who canceled entire trip to europe. red card for monte carlo tournament?
joeyisaks,socialism doesnt work and never has worked.. i wish the le free throw  didnt go so extreme and we could just go with bloomberg biden or mayor pete
joeyisaks,tom you hit it on the head with this one... also saying no service provides + expected value picks is just being ignorant of the competition out there
joeyisaks,do students who paid their own way or had family save up for years and work multiple jobs to send their kid to college get a refund too?
joeyisaks,loved those mariners teams so much but he was never even one of their best two hitters so to me its hard for him to be a hof
EdMillerPoker,theres a sub-genre of careers in having bad opinions loudly that are targeted to an audience th against the spread sick of the more mainstream bad opinions loudly
EdMillerPoker,"select all the accounts that will never tweet anything of interest to you.

ok. shirtless dude. hammer and sickle. shirtless dude. shirtless dude. that nun symbol. shirtless dude."
EdMillerPoker,because nevada is a small market and was the only game in town. we started o you are business essentially the day the supreme court decision was announced.
EdMillerPoker,oh i see. in general i recommend if you can tolerate the risk to just bet the bad side of scalps to the extent you can identify them.
EdMillerPoker,"the reason for the relatively low in-play betting volumes in the us can be explained 80 percent  by the ""so i rarely try anymore"" quote from that thread"
EdMillerPoker,for a number of reasons im ske point ical that micromarket in-play o point ions like the one you described will ever be much more than a novelty.
EdMillerPoker,hmm im n overtime sure.  for what  it is  worth  all that material and much more is being published as a book in the next month or two.
EdMillerPoker,obv im not. but spend 9 figures on branding and it gets you market share out of the gate esp when you're ready to launch first as well
nonrandomalpha,you dont know what happened? nagy has let him run...opening up everything else. playing 3 of the most recently challenged ds have also helped. n overtime rocket science.
nonrandomalpha,as mentioned i do like the upside of jjaw but  it is  still highly speculative. implying he's already a slamdunk bonafide nfl starter is n overtime intellectually honest.
LeeSharpeNFL,no if they were the correlation wouldn't be this strong. pff grades do a good job of isolating player components  expected points added  is fundamentally a team stat.
LeeSharpeNFL,the former dominantly though n overtime saying  it is  the only thing. i think the other two are false though i haven't looked into the middle one specifically.
LeeSharpeNFL,i can only annotate so many plays on my win probability charts this game is trying to see how many plays the code will be forced to omit.
LeeSharpeNFL,mia offers him two first round picks and he says no even though his desired pick will still be there with the 4th overall pick he'll now have.
LeeSharpeNFL,wow  has a prop bet up for who will be the cowboys head coach for week 1 in 2020 and kellen moore isn't even an o point ion.
LeeSharpeNFL,"it would be ""funny"" if there were more coaches assigned to stopping their bosses from making bad decisions in this area than to studying actually making good ones."
whale_capper,nfl playoff picture framing... pr expected points added re yourself for a shocking heel turn in the nfc while we continue to see purple in the afc enjoy!
whale_capper,definitely as we talked about the median misfit on closing win totals is 2 games more than half of these will be off by greater than 2 games
whale_capper,this seems like an attem point  to save face but regardless at this point if youre still a knicks fan you have no one to blame but yourself
whale_capper,they are spending the better part of a week on the road and there is a pretty significant difference in facilities available to them here vs at home
AndyMSFW,let us  n overtime let the fact that the browns are absolutely going to be good distract us from the fact that the redskins might be abysmal. #wasvscle
AndyMSFW,this is troubling and i especially agree with that l assit point but i also  daily fantasy sports  really have faith in a regulatory agency to be proactive.
JoeyKnish22,huh. th against the spread funny. seen a l overtime of twitter pickzzz cappers on houston within the l assit ho you are or so. what a coincidence.
JoeyKnish22,"max told some of us he won this pool a few years back.  and i went back and audited the standings back to 2012. 

he never won. #delusional"
JoeyKnish22,nah. wont be as much hedge room as you think numbers have adjusted down and i doubt either team is live game 1 of the playoff as is.
JoeyKnish22,"lost in the shuffle of all l assit nights browns/steelers fight drama was the most important aspect...

(was a great night all around for ravens division futures )"
JoeyKnish22,probably the whitest comment youll see on this app today. also has a farm animal avatar. guy is probably eating mayonnaise out of the jar watching this game.
JoeyKnish22,i hear you. was n overtime an easy job. but he made a tough situation its a disastrous one. the next guy is walking into a dumpster fire.
JoeyKnish22,right!?!? roughly 40 games youve only challenged 11 times?? and lost them all?? the odds of that streak over that amount of games has to be assit ronomical
JoeyKnish22,lmao im pretty surprised too. i might try like a 1.1 or that smart speed to remove long pauses but i never see myself as a 1.5-2x guy.
JoeyKnish22,used to work in hr-recruiting right out of college. hundreds of interviews still have  points d from all the the dumb shit and awkward situations i sat through.
TheKostos,as long as cooper kupp doesn't go crazy tonight i'm fine with whatever happens. have a massive buy-in season-long playoff matchup that will basically be decided by kupp
TheKostos,gase showed what a bad coach he is yesterday with the inability to adjust and score points a free throw er hal free throw ime. pathetic. guy stinks
TheKostos,maybe a crazy comment but i think the oilers would have given the skins a game. would have beaten buffalo if n overtime for mini collapse at denver
TheKostos,will al riveron come out of his cave to give an explanation for raheem mostert's clear and obvious first down that the officials ruled short of the marker?
TheKostos,nba and  college basketball  picks for tonight coming in the first ho you are plus lots of great kc/ten and gb/sf discussion  college football  futures mlb win totals
LockyLockerson,full projections for the nba and college basketball up on patreon for a busy friday!  come hang and look at spreadsheets.   it is  n overtime dorky i promise.
LockyLockerson,also happy to report i'll be betting a 14-point home 'dog to win on the field saturday.   that is  always turned out well 100 percent  of the time.
LockyLockerson,lakers-warriors is the only late-start game and lebron is out.  this is the perfect night to finally start the new season of narcos: mexico when i get home.
LockyLockerson,the best part is i have no idea what she wolf sounds like at the start so it took me like 15 seconds to know if i won
LockyLockerson,could sell me on chiefs favored at under a field goal just because maybe people want to bet on them more.  also depends on next week's games obviously.
LockyLockerson,he was on 60 minutes l assit season.  we know him.  and notoriety generally comes with postseason success so once he has that this will be settled no?
EliHershkovich,on the under. nebraska well-rested and should look to run but it has zero matchup advantages vs. iu  can't see its lack of size hanging on the glass.
EliHershkovich,"doubt turgeon will do it but if i'm maryland put wiggins on howard from the jump and make him uncomfortable.

Gingfacekillah,almost too broad to answer. it really depends on the nature of the prop. should have a few ideas for you in ssme2 when it comes out :)
Gingfacekillah,has some of the best information available on testing betting records for statistical significance on his website.  it is  well worth reading as much as you can there.
Gingfacekillah,i usually wait until week 4 to start getting serious about the nfl. n overtime my strong suit. here's how the team pointspread ratings are looking so far:
Gingfacekillah,honestly i still like the over. this should be a tight game with tor leading and det hustling to keep up and try and squeak out the win.
Gingfacekillah,feature selection with rfe. difficult to break 64-68 percent  with standard st against the spread or basic differential features. the search for more robust features continues this week.

adamchernoff,"i think you meant the game but the kc team total is n overtime a stretch at 49 against the titans. 

i am being sarcastic...but n overtime really."
adamchernoff,i would say the way that the line moved (was bal -1 and closed bal -4 on the road) the ravens g overtime an enormous amount of respect.
adamchernoff,n overtime betting either way just trying to offer some value on what is continuing to be a more and more common way to handicap second half wagers.

kellyinvegas,the caribbean side buddy. its on the e assit co assit of the country. ive never been to the e assit co assit of cr. only the west.

kellyinvegas,i get this question a lot.  puts his out for free on his  page  has an amazing numbers mag he puts out  for a website i really like
kellyinvegas,i only bet 2- team 6- point teasers. nothing about those is worth it. you for it to make sense you need to be teasing through key numbers.
kellyinvegas,i lean iowa. i made the game iowa -4. i like minnesota a lot. but they may be a little overvalued a free throw er l assit weekend.

TheCousinSal,i know theres still another quarter remaining but the cowboys really dont have a realistic chance to win this game. (attem point ing the patented  reverse jinx here)
TheCousinSal,its hard to believe that this next statement is accurate a free throw er the patriots game but...that may have been san darnolds worst pick of the season.
TheCousinSal,and he will further prove this a free throw er leading the colts to victory in sb 54. cmon  - ditch the headset and lets get to work!

12Xpert,no idea how you calculate edge here. as far as i'm concerned they are the same thing. match 1 gives 16.67 percent  match 2 gives 25 percent .
12Xpert,sorry i  daily fantasy sports  yet but i can check this. presumably you want to see how the bigger (more liquid) leagues compare to the smaller ones right?
12Xpert,you can get them from oddsportal. you could also see if indatabetcom have them (for a small fee). they do cover other sports n overtime sure about nfl.

mschwimer,steve duncker was the chairman of nyra and personally did several deals with betfair. but its clear you didnt do  years old you are research on those names.

RufusPeabody,daily fantasy sports  forget the pillars of jambos: transparency and integrity. there has literally never been anyone in the history of transparency that is more transparent than
RufusPeabody,wait maybe i'm n overtime understanding you properly. i  daily fantasy sports  sell picks. i  daily fantasy sports  sell anything. just want to make that perfectly clear.
RufusPeabody,i have a 50 percent  +/- 0 percent  prior for flipping a coin. so no matter what results i see ill still believe its truly 50 percent
RufusPeabody,+0.5 f5 and  moneyline f5 on the same game? at this point just freaking release plays with different unit sizes since  that is  what you're doing anyway
RufusPeabody,correct me if im wrong but havent teams been using analytics for some time now? they just prefer to keep their findings to themselves. competitive edge yknow?
RufusPeabody,more involved but ideally you want to simulate accounting for dynamic uncertainty  wont affect mean number of wins but necessary for properly modeling variance of the distribution
RufusPeabody,if youve g overtime time this is the story of the worst video game of all time! (disclosure: my super talented sister  hosts and produces the podcast)
RufusPeabody,my point exactly. and what o free throw en ends up happening if theyre really good is the syndicates approach the handicapper about working with them exclusively.
RufusPeabody,"you see people all the time saying money management had held them back from becoming a winning bettor. so i meant ""holding back"" from being a winner."
RufusPeabody,luckily my bottom line isnt influenced by  years old you are opinion. ive always taken going bust to mean losing it all. its why i bet conservatively.
RufusPeabody,so what you're saying is they're comingling their bankroll with their subscri point ion fees. if they actually tracked their bets they'd have a pretty clear idea.
RufusPeabody,i am using an analogy to make a broader point.  years old you are comment is inane and doesn't address the point i'm making in this thread.
RufusPeabody,you're right. you'll never be able to solve this issue but if you can put some safeguards in place and help some people  that is  worth something.
RufusPeabody,based on what they did a free throw er the sbnc i doubt it. they didn't give me anything besides a 'we're sorry for the regrettable experience'
RufusPeabody,once again if you want to be transparent release the results of the 12-person survey. prove my theory that there were only 12 people who responded wrong!
jeffma,th against the spread fine. but my point is that it is still n overtime a best bet for him so why tweet out the trends unless...

SportsCheetah,im shocked the lakers late-game 30-fo overtime 3 offense didnt work without ad around to grab orebs and block shots at the rim on the defensive side.

capjack2000,interestingly out of those companies you just mentioned none have shown a net profit in any us state yet. gvc currently losing $50m per month in nj.
capjack2000,th against the spread 20 percent  higher than some other us operators i know. i will say that pb actually trades the other is just following orders.
capjack2000,that is  why i'm glad the nj books are offering it. lowers the chance of being smacked in the head by at le assit 41 percent .
capjack2000,they never even tried the vegas mgm app outside of nv. previous to this platform it was the stadium technology version of playmgm. it was highly capable.
capjack2000,no need to drop entire bankrolls unless that gig you have pays far less than it should. here's the response when trying to bet into those lines:
capjack2000,only if  years old you are credit card company permits the transaction. unfortunately all the major us credit card banks do not. ymmv with lesser known cards.
capjack2000,well they've tried to enter the uk multiple times and aborted each attem point . i've always been curious as well. obviously there is a counter-force there.
capjack2000,hmm...could this signal william hill getting into the online casino space in nj? theyve previously resisted affiliate marketing because their margins were too low to support it.
capjack2000,"7 days from now there is bettable nfl action. so where are the new operators in nj that were due to launch this summer?
bet365?
betworks?
kindred?"
capjack2000,the geographic footprint of caesars and eldorado make a merger viable. very little overlap in their jurisdictions. that said eldorado will definitely want to trim some properties.
capjack2000,th against the spread true. if anything hold percent  will increase as the acquisition costs begin to subside. paddy indicated that in their quarterly earning as well.
capjack2000,to celebrate sports betting independence day i sat down with whale and andy and talked about where weve been and where were headed in the legalized markets.
capjack2000,"dont forget the two technical fouls!

its like that scene in the natural when gus guesses how much money is in roy hobbs pocket...dont forget the silver."
capjack2000,recent reports have wynn drastically reducing comps and comp rates. so  daily fantasy sports  believe this is all out of charity. they're just finding the money elsewhere.
capjack2000,playing 1h derivatives for nba teams down 2-0 in a series appears to be an angle the market has adjusted for. i think that angle is dead.
capjack2000,interesting thread but  years old you are premise is flawed if based on this . some forms of business are predatory. bookmaking can be touting definitely is.
capjack2000,one l assit update. all games are now listed at  i do like that -105 on nationally broadc assit games. hope they hold that for the playoffs.
capjack2000,once youtube starts to monetize ad revenue for gambling content in the us the way they do in europe shell have the l assit laugh on us.
dinkinc,i have a college basketball model based on you... first step is to make sure i never heard of any players...done.... second step is now under consideration
dinkinc,i think bookmakers would like to put an end to exhibition football more than anyone else .. i am sure some of my friends are killing it
dinkinc,i just have to find a way to keep the charity alive .. message me  years old you are phone number.  n overtime sure i have it
robpizzola,its almost as if one of these teams has russell wilson and the other doesnt. the seahawks win in spite of carroll n overtime because of him.
robpizzola,those interce point ions hes talking about led to a ton of heartbreak for me over the years but my god do i ever respect this man.
robpizzola,naturally a free throw er a bunch of successful passes in a row they run carlos hyde up the middle for zero yards on first down... again.
robpizzola,i think its pretty common for media to make excuses for young quarterbacks. i dont think it has anything to do with the color of his skin.
robpizzola,"i always love looking back on early season nfl spreads just to see how out to lunch we were.

san francisco pk at cincinnati in week 2"
robpizzola,can be a good deal for both teams which i think it is. love that dubas was able to get colorado to retain half of barries salary.
robpizzola,for those who wanna rip toronto for being classless the crowd is giving kd a standing ovation and chanting k.d. as he leaves the court right now.
RASPicks,"btw if something as basic as a ""fade the public"" strategy ever presented true quantifiable edges to bettors the market would have adjusted for it by now."
RASPicks,"clearly o you are service isn't for everyone but if +307 units means ""lost tons of money"" to you then i'm guessing you have some other issues."
RASPicks,only buy points when its the right thing to do on its own such as on/off 3 or 7 for 10 cents but few offer that anymore.
RASPicks,i was talking about the total.  down from 56 to 54/54.5.  no opinion on side.  maybe would take a sh overtime at az if a 6.5 showed.
RASPicks,o you are  college football  totals are 22-8 73.3 percent  y touchdown .  you can always easily find pick archives/records on o you are website at .co/hbwajbre

ProfessorShine,their goal is get as much cash as possible in any way possible.  espn endorsing this guy tells you what an irresponsible money grab this actually is.
ProfessorShine,amazed so many dont know ms hotty threesome before her showtime days.  shes made fun of fat girls and dead pro bettors but joeys n overtime nice?
ProfessorShine,i dont know where alex mather grew up in philly but no one i knew gave a shit about the inquirer sports section.  it was always dn.
ProfessorShine,i think ras is suggesting free pick givers may have an agenda. some offer free picks in goal of getting h overtime get a following then charge.
ProfessorShine,of course crawford\khan would end in a lousy way.  crawford was about a 90 percent  fav to win.  these are n overtime supposed to be competitive fights.
ProfessorShine,when assit ros sucked a few  years back they rolled into anaheim  swe point  i think as ridiculous dogs. be careful trying to crunch balt all year
ProfessorShine,the old garden st park location had always been mentioned as a future betting site. the fact it is held up is disappointing but n overtime surprising
suuma810,i honestly  daily fantasy sports  look at them and  daily fantasy sports  know which are the most 'reliable'. therefore i cann overtime give you good answer sorry!
suuma810,bettors love the buffalo #bills regular season win total to go over. i'm n overtime drinking the kool-aid. my team preview is ready for all 2019 members:
suuma810,and the #bucs dra free throw ed a nose tackle at 12 because their ex-dc thought that stopping the run is the number one priority in 2018.
suuma810,if you like matchups: chandler jones  markus golden against the rookie tackle tandem kolton miller  brandon parker this week. another rough week for derek carr. #cardinals #raiders
suuma810,the #jaguars dra free throw ed a rb 4th overall and today they benched blake bortles while getting beat by a qb they passed on for fournette.
suuma810,lowvig has already released a line for the #chiefs / #rams game in week eleven. la is favored by -3 at -121 with a total of 59.5.
suuma810,"the #bengals are now -1 -105 favorites at  

were bet up to +3.5 early august and came down to +3 late august / early se point ember."
suuma810,the #saints just traded for their brees successor and suddenly have a quality starter as their backup for two years - if they offer him an extension.
ClevTA,well then philly is awful im sure u will have  years old you are life savings on seattle bc its impossible for philly to win. good luck
ClevTA,its some of the best bettors in the world who use models and refuse to think its possible to actually handicap motivation so they essentially ignore it
ClevTA,this is what it feels like when navy runs for 7 yards a pop and having zero sh overtime to ever slow the o point ion down
ClevTA,sure but sf d is much much better than seattle and is top 3 in pressure rate so they can withstand a few runs compared to seattle
ClevTA,what game are u watching? shouldve been picked off on first drive then throws across the field on a 2 yard crossing route to landry. its awful
ClevTA,i tend to agree with the allen comment. going from noodlearm cam to a qb who can potentially get it downfield cant possibly be such a downgrade
ClevTA,carolina was definitely a consideration bc i dont think allen is that bad. i am concerned about that defense and short being doubtful. it just missed tho
ClevTA,perfectly smart move by freddie there trying to draw them off. u have zero downside all upside. 95 percent  of nfl coaches dont even think of that

spanky,"you g overtime it pal.  contrary to what the queens da has said ive never booked before. i could only imagine how difficult it must be.  

respect"
spanky,im citing case law and  years old you are citing sports illustrated. that being said we both can agree bettors are exem point  from violating any law.
spanky,what is the difference whether player a plays the patriots or player b does....  the money of one isint any greener that the money of the other....
spanky,actually wynn comes up first a lot. of course once  hangs their numbers up wynn takes theirs down in a panic to reopen them to the  number.
spanky,n overtime having a limits sheet is ridiculous. its equivalent to sitting at a table game in a casino without a sign of  minutes and max bet.
spanky,odds of hitting mega millions: 259 million to 1...current payout is 900 million for a $2 ticket or 450 million to 1.. are we in positive ev???
spanky,in my opinion the only way they pay the bet off is if theyre forced. i dont think they will go for an unexpected 80k marketing expense.
DocBettor,"challenge was right 
i was in just as much disbelief watching the 56 percent  3 point shooting *increase* right a free throw er i made the bet"
DocBettor,obviously kidding i love watching games. but this live bet view is the best i've seen for a consolidated overall summary with in-play / in-game wagering lines.
DocBettor,how can i go back to watching games when all broadc assits (even on regular old tv) are slower than this youwager live betting summary view #gamblingtwitter
DocBettor,"live bet on the dodgers to score one more run in this game vs the giants (aka team total over 3.5) -120

#sportsbetting #gamblingtwitter #dodgers #sfvslad #lableedsblue"
DocBettor,hey  curious why you dont recommend varied bet sizes? with different edges even a simple small vs big bet system would be better positive expected value right?
PlusEVAnalytics,oh yeah i believe growth is a major contributing factor but how to solve it without resorting to something extreme like communism? be against the spread me.
PlusEVAnalytics,what the fuck  so if i take bets in the back room of my pool hall but the pool hall is my core business its all good?
PlusEVAnalytics,theyve been awful all year but yeah as a 13.5 point dog to one of the best teams in the league that will be the true test...
PlusEVAnalytics,i think if you assumed 29 of them were independent and the 30th was completely dependent that wouldnt be perfect but it should be in the ballpark.
PlusEVAnalytics,the polar ice caps are melting and also  years old you are face is on fire. which one should you spend  years old you are energy on?
PlusEVAnalytics,gotta prorate the subscri point ion fee and the rebate then less than 2/17 of it has been realized. if were gonna get weird lets get weird.
PlusEVAnalytics,it might n overtime be super important in terms of bet sizing but its important in terms of understanding the performance of  years old you are model.
PlusEVAnalytics,unless kawhi is hurt did we really learn all that much new information about these teams l assit night that we didnt already know from 90+ games?
PlusEVAnalytics,til at a french craps table n overtime only is 11  years old as always but 10 is bonbon - i guess because dix sounds like six?
PlusEVAnalytics,maybe  can chime in with his data on pregame picks (bad models if there ever were)? any idea how those picks would have done with vig removed?
PlusEVAnalytics,you and me both. i had to settle for the spanish 21 fiesta in tijuana. won the gomez cup and g overtime a huge bottle of tequila!
PlusEVAnalytics,contagion is sufficient but n overtime necessary for epistemic uncertainty. im more scared of assit eroids and nuclear holocausts even though they kill fewer people than bathtubs.
PlusEVAnalytics,did everyone with a fever go to the hospital when hospitals were overcrowded and there was a pandemic fear in the air? how can we know this?
aluckyaday,any information on how he is planning on solving the 2 big issues with exchanges? liquidity and the fact that recreational punters  daily fantasy sports  like/understand them?
aluckyaday,personally i would recommend  's follow up sharps and squares book. one the same theme but covers more topics than the first one. better still buy both
aluckyaday,never used them before just signed up this weekend for the free breeders cup bets! would have thought they would let you bet pools even if restricted.
aluckyaday,i presume you are going to sue the originator for damage to  years old you are reputation then? if n overtime it makes you a laughing stock.
aluckyaday,plus if the are that special they will become one of those making the 6/7 figure bets in asia that are causing the overnight line to move!
aluckyaday,once you have switched to basic it only seems to show that one but if you click on view details there is a link to change plan.
aluckyaday,n overtime around in the morning so turning back time and putting the selection up the night before. bettor prices than quoted are available but without bog.
aluckyaday,do the uci have any facilities at the finish? the ladies working on the race should form a queue outside them. i'll leave the rest to you....
aluckyaday,"i've used it quite a l overtime already. americans have a l overtime of catching up to do on way the rest of the world does ""bookmaking""!"
aluckyaday,obviously! and you account profile will be updated accordingly. to be honest backing an obvious rick is n overtime going to do you much good long term
aluckyaday,downhill finish in to bardet's birthplace on bastille day.g overtime to have him on my list as i'd never forgive myself if he could pull it off!
aluckyaday,my inplay strategy of being able to quickly identify dqs riders is over. going to be much easier to recognise boh riders for the next year though!
aluckyaday,isn't -8.3 percent  an interesting number though what is the sample size? what is the likelihood of that happening by chance when the margin should be 2.5ish?
joeytunes2,yea did you think they know how to book?  it is  easy to weed out guys with a opinion and keep losers.  that is  n overtime booking.
joeyisaks,was there l assit night too too bad we didnt run into each other z! its great - think its on netflix can just watch there too
joeyisaks,its a weak division. can upgrade catcher mid season if needed and no reason to over pay harper or machado when next year can spend more freely
joeyisaks,ugh th against the spread the absolute worst! especially when shes saying obv first date things !!! then whole bar knows  you are on a first date
EdMillerPoker,yes if the descri point ion on amazon appeals to you then you should get it. if you arent interested in game theory stuff then maybe not.
EdMillerPoker,a well put together in-game menu consistently offering germane occasionally novel bets with ~4 percent ish hold on everything zero delays and bet rejections and reasonable limits.
EdMillerPoker,yeah we g overtime my son a switch for christmas and i messed around with the new smash game. its good wish i had more free time.
EdMillerPoker,bitching about songbirds in spring is a core twitter use case and is also just about all you need to know about how things work around here
EdMillerPoker,judging by my timeline today we gonna have a l overtime of bros betting shitty models this year like fangraphs is a secret only they know about
EdMillerPoker,this fee stuff all still feels like flailing but the more i think about this stuff the more leverage i think the leagues will have long term

nonrandomalpha,"as always o you are detailed  #sportfolio weekly performance report post-nfl week 3 will drop tonight. 

here is a sneak peek...nfl core strategy v. relevant competitors season-to-date."
nonrandomalpha,you can find comfort in distraction and other teams failures but th against the spread n overtime the uf way. worry about o you are own house.
LeeSharpeNFL,i do think no is better than sf just the fact that no didn't get a bye hurts them and that they'd have to play at sf.
LeeSharpeNFL,the 2019 nfl season but every team won exactly half of their one score games (with a tie if they had an odd number of such games).
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  happening because  it is  taking my preseason expectations into account n overtime just the result of the week 1 game (though did they lose those!)
LeeSharpeNFL,and on top of this... there is also the fact that the implausibility of his claim significantly increases the likelihood that he isn't speaking in good faith.
LeeSharpeNFL,the part where he attributes jackson's success to the opponent's inability to see him rather than jackson's talent as would have been done with a white player.
LeeSharpeNFL,bills use l assit timeout with a stopped clock at 10 seconds le free throw  on their own 45. much harder to get a field goal. awful.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""you g overtime  years old you are football tweets in my politics tweets!"" 

""no you g overtime  years old you are politics tweets in my football tweets!"""
LeeSharpeNFL,oh nice! i went there many times back when i was in illinois and know a l overtime of that team.  it is  a well run show!
LeeSharpeNFL,love that nagy went for it on 4th there and trubisky's decision was somewhat aggressive but i  daily fantasy sports  hate it. the pass was also good.
whale_capper,"1. track all  years old you are plays

whale_capper,3 touchdown s and 3 xps probably... in seriousness i have them as an above average offense and give them some advantages due to their travel decisions
whale_capper,the deep dive listeners impressed the hell out of me today... most requests i've ever gotten post- podcast and  it is  for the z-score calc article :
AndyMSFW,if you bet the under in the hawaii/mormons game  daily fantasy sports  bother getting out of bed tomorrow cause santa is skipping  years old you are house.
AndyMSFW,drops  years old you are break even percentage on single legs by 1.66 percent  for sure might be worth looking into expanding  years old you are teasing.
AndyMSFW,i like watching and occasionally punting on it but it might be the hardest damn market in the world to beat.  i stick to turkish super lig.
AndyMSFW,that side of the family is directly descended from catherine the great.  so i guess you could say that we have horses in o you are blood.
AndyMSFW,"switching up my 3-ball approach a bit hopefully to some success.

armo you are over blixt/cink +175
hossler over varner/lee +200
horschel over watson/matsuyama +200"
AndyMSFW,finau and molinari have been nice moving day stories but imagine walking up to the teebox tomorrow and seeing this animal staring back at you. #goodeffingluck #themasters
AndyMSFW,depends on the weather i suppose but i think they way the fellas have played the 3s the p assit decade it should be closer to -200.

JoeyKnish22,youll be paying for it this weekend when i start screaming at the counter and recording a spanky video because you didnt give me enough drink tickets.
JoeyKnish22,n overtime sure how this helps you or what to bet here. but i wont be eating there again for awhile  for what  it is  worth .
JoeyKnish22,took me 12 weeks of serving mahomes kool-aid to fend off the nfl media brees apologist campaign. im primed and ready for a full season burrow sauce.
JoeyKnish22,lmaoo i heard a free throw er orgeron gets fired this year when they go 5-7 lsu alums want to try and hire harbaugh away from michigan
TheKostos,there's no way a stat correction would be six points right? i won one matchup by 5 and sat the bills defense to prevent a doomsday result
TheKostos,so much good shit coming up tonight with great guests and review of the weekend + previewing bowl games and nfl week 15/ monday night football  tonight
TheKostos,is that gonna be it for lamar and ingram? i need that to be it for lamar and ingram. my 90 point lead is now 4 lol
TheKostos,rivers is shot.  it is  over. just hand it off to gordon and ekeler and get out of mexico with a win. this is n overtime difficult
TheKostos,just want to make sure no one has forgotten the houston  are cheating scumbags and should have to forfeit the 2017 world series. thank you for reading
TheKostos,seems like you should reflect on  years old you are life decision to follow me on twitter. have a great rest of  years old you are sunday

TheKostos,man i'd be down for the breds myself but i'm a 10.5 in 350s. dope pair you should be able to get a nice price for them
LockyLockerson,my absolute favorite thing: in a tie game l assit possession a player waiting to the l assit second and choosing to sho overtime a 3.  incredible.
LockyLockerson,was snowed in but that didnt stop myself and nick from having some great discussion and some great guests on.  and my daughter is a gambling savant.
LockyLockerson,for my own stuff? yes.  for twitter picks? no.  guess would be like 49-50 percent  but i mean that is really ballparking it.  error +/- 5 percent
LockyLockerson,anything else? go to brad and gary? go to the hal free throw ime studio th against the spread already set up for updates of other games?
LockyLockerson,"no i'm saying none of them really matter to this game specifically.  so in a way yes they are on the same level as ""n overtime mattering"""
LockyLockerson,home from an a free throw ernoon/night out somehow cyhawk isnt over and apparently franks g overtime some kind of gruesome injury.  seems like a busy saturday.
LockyLockerson,believe me i  daily fantasy sports  think about 90 percent  of these guys can win but have to go thru the motions in an unbiased way lol
LockyLockerson,what ended up happening with people who bet on that atrocity in canada l assit night?  did sites refund anything as no action? did everything pay out?
LockyLockerson,in the cfp era 4 teams have had a win total that closed 11 or 11.5. those teams won 11 11 12 and 12 regular-season games respectively.
LockyLockerson,when i went to college near a sheetz they carried this stuff called gallikers that was straight crack.  addictive and totally bad for you.  best chocolate milk.
LockyLockerson,i could also argue he had the mvp of the league on the team but then its a chicken/egg thing with whether the offense unlocked him etc.
EliHershkovich,"always a bl assit co-hosting with    college football  #bestbets oregon-washington/michigan-psu  lots of nfl betting breakdown.

DannyParkins,stephen a asked dabo if he was worried clemson could miss the playoff if they go undefeated?!?! theres a zero point zero percent chance that would happen.
DannyParkins,my mentions are a dumpster fire so to just make things cleaner i'll remind everyone i said deshaun watson should've been the first overall pick in 2017.
chadmillman,somehow since i posted this story two days ago the money has come in against my new favorite team (and its n overtime the browns!) no respect.

chadmillman,we can agree there is only one question that matters in  monday night football . will fitzmagic continue to be the gqbwel (greatest qb who ever lived)?
chadmillman,rally a free throw er nfl nuttiness w/full nba slate. this betting/ daily fantasy sports  preview is like the greasy fries a free throw er a hangover.

Gingfacekillah,experimental and still tweaking probabilities but there appears to be value. take the positive expected value calcs with a grain of salt until i dial them in.
logan_matthews9,i dont think the argument is a particularly useful exercise as the jags dont give foles $80m over fo you are years with a first round qb
logan_matthews9,to somewhat play devils advocate here - assuming we get france durkin isnt the holding mid you want and mendez is a luxury player we cant afford
logan_matthews9,gsw missed a three with 18 seconds le free throw ... and no knicks crashed the boards so they put it back uncontested. tough one to watch

12Xpert,"their piece simply says ""secret report"". so this is just journalism n overtime science. there's a difference (and also why journalists do journalism and scientists do science)."
12Xpert,"any peer-reviewed journal papers supporting that viewpoint?

leisure punters are the bread and butter of this bookmaking model. if they didn't have them there'd be no market."
12Xpert,because i've only included the period where the league is played over 38 games. the first two were 42 games and they won the second of those.
12Xpert,if #albertosalazar is guilty of doping violations but none of his athletes have been convicted of doping violations what does that say about the drug testing regime?
12Xpert,th against the spread n overtime something ive ever argued for nor would i. there was a referendum. parliament voted in large numbers to respect the result.
12Xpert,i also make this little visual calculator available on  my website to help you see expected ranges of randomness about any skill you might think you have.
12Xpert,"weekend extra leagues fixtures available: 
argentina superleague has have almost no bookmakers pricing their opening round fixtures so will add later as and when more are published."
12Xpert,this is precisely it. which is why women's tennis and athletics is virtually on a level playing field with men's in terms of building narratives and stories.
12Xpert,the number of no-show sharps like you will be but a tiny proportion of the number of no-show squares. survivorship bias is much stronger in that direction.

capjack2000,i appreciate the honest reply. thanks. i will say the parlay boosts  are solid gains for the player. look forward to seeing the expanded prop markets.
capjack2000,did you actually place the bet? given their approval process i doubt that wager was acce point ed. if it was it should go as written.

dinkinc,loved.... no way he plays another game this season and maybe more... smart people snap too.... you are really ridiculous and blinded by some team loyalty

robpizzola,sf was only lower entering yesterday due to injuries. they would be higher when healthy. a free throw er yesterday's games ne has dropped to #5.
robpizzola,you consider yourself a good person nick? i only ask because youve been wishing athletes and their families a terrible christmas for a few weeks now.
robpizzola,i should note that i actually typed in babcock for this tweet (i dont want to disrespect the man publicly) but phone auto-corrected to babcuck lol
robpizzola,really selfish move of me to give out candy to kids. should just turn the lights off and head out to catch a flick next year.
robpizzola,question isn't whether or n overtime  it is  industry standard. i think we need to get away from what's considered industry standard if i'm being honest.
robpizzola,i for one am extremely excited for all of the could alabama beat the miami dolphins? content that is headed o you are way this season.

VegasRefund,every time i try to become interested in the world cup im reminded by how pathetic it is that the usa is n overtime a participant.
VegasRefund,"total was at 136.. steamed down to 127.. then leading up to game time was steamed back up to about 133.

game ended with 128 points"
VegasRefund,before you run to play the colts.. lets n overtime forget that peterman was playing the chargers on the road when he threw the 5 ints...
ProfessorShine,the conflict is that if chad is going to market tan as a way to make rec bettors better  maybe add a disclaimer to this info
ProfessorShine,units breakdown is silly also.         if it were legal id book you in a quick minute just for the lol.    but keep up those great writeups.
ProfessorShine,as soon as i saw my nba plays on some betting board i figured i should stop posting.  only fly under the radar for so long.
suuma810,dazu kommt dass die bengals z you are pause schon eine siegwahrscheinlichkeit von 89 percent  hatten. 17 runs finde ich in dem spiel eher zu viel.
suuma810,ich vermisse bootlegs/rollouts mit tieferen shots. wre fr murray doch o point imal. weg von der ol me ho you are big play opportunity sonst laufen.
suuma810,i think the rosen trade was a great one. he costs nothing and has high upside. and they acquired a 2020 second rounder in the process.
suuma810,fair enough aber dann htte es fr diese saison der tag getan. dann htte man entweder dieses oder nchstes ja ho you are ersatz finden knnen.
suuma810,aren't the final fo you are playoff teams and their respective passing offenses / play-calling tendencies enough reason for every team to want a 'pass-first' approach?
suuma810,cowboys on the red zone possession: run-first team and on 1st  goal - when they also could burn the clock - they decide to pass twice.
suuma810,agree but that would put stress on every ol. the p against the spread line is improved from l assit year with the upgrade at lt.
ClevTA,right its that you think gb is better n overtime what the market thinks which is what the -3 reflects. th against the spread the point
ClevTA,i thought with all the guys who could be used bc of week 17 chaos that ownership wasnt a concern. so many cheap backups were available.
ClevTA,young kid under contract. u take a sh overtime to see if hes legit with tons of playing time. clarkson is a nothing as an expiring
ClevTA,yeah i mean who wouldnt want food that tastes really really good cool atmosphere with h overtime girls walking around when they are in vegas! lol
ClevTA,i took -2. even if driskel does play his legs are his biggest asset so a bad hammy on a short week is a huge problem.
ClevTA,titans will be climbing even more this week. just waiting for the first tannehill mvp talk from one of the awful espn or fox morning shows
ClevTA,0  touchdown  3 int and 6.2 yards per attem point  in 4 preseason gms this season. i think we'll see 50 carries from lindsey and freeman
ClevTA,lol brandon allen. dont mess with m fi'in fangio. browns were +1 as of this morning. i would guess browns are -4/5 but a pure guess
ClevTA,its so hard bc williams is coming back. mccoy wouldve had a great matchup otherwise. go jones just bc his volume is guaranteed without j williams
ClevTA,ive posted this all summer props now here. ill still post against the spread  picks free on sunday mornings but the props are in this package
ClevTA,i heard dan starting to say happy birthday and thought torey was going to get her due then it turned out it was for beyonc instead
CizzlingSports,are u guys  aware that  years old you are response to the  article uses different fonts in places which commonly discloses careful edits to original language
CizzlingSports,"mid-sized car payment"" play.

""take  years old you are wife to a nice meal"" play.

this is  self-anointed ""go-to gambooling guy""

CizzlingSports,this is both preposterous and incredible from  but  daily fantasy sports  let it distract from the fact that  also did a fantastic job covering the merits.

spanky,im having a good time doing these podcasts.  i hope they are as fun for you to listen to as they are for me to record....
spanky,lol please dont call me. i have no time to talk with a scam artist.  keep selling  years old you are snake oil to the degenerates.
spanky,"i dont really need models (recipes).  winning is trivial at this point for us.

i just need outs (ingredients). getting down is always the biggest challenge."
spanky,for years we would have an office outing on all star tuesday. one of the best team building activities we ever did was with  highly recommend!
spanky,hey  i used to watch you on proline with jim feist on saturday mornings when i was a kid... you keep going like the energizer bunny.
spanky,since im asked this on a daily basis i figured id make this list. here are the reasons why i dont tout (in no particular order)
DocBettor,#nba live bet: los angeles lakers  moneyline -233 vs the pj tucker-at-the-5 houston rockets is a gi free throw  unless it loses of course #houvslal #lakeshow
DocBettor,haha all i said was  is n overtime clueless and that twitter has a bookmarking feature so you could use that for bookmarks if you want
DocBettor,"im rolling with toronto points of highest scorer - +110 vs milwaukee points of highest scorer.

for reference kawhis over/under is 30 and giannis is 27."
PlusEVAnalytics,th against the spread n overtime true. its confusing because the construction of the problem is unusual - its rejecting the deal that is the gamble.
PlusEVAnalytics,speaking of growth im starting a new business teaching email scammers proper english spelling grammar and syntax. promising a 10 percent  yoy increase in converted marks.
PlusEVAnalytics,the guitar effect in the intro was n overtime developed from theory it was discovered by accident while messing around. this is what #antifragile sounds like.
PlusEVAnalytics,does that account for the loss of value from pushing  years old you are portfolio out of step with the one used to evaluate the guarantee?
PlusEVAnalytics,as dumb as martingale is generally its extra dumb at blackjack. 32 units on the table and get dealt 88 then 8 then 8 then 3....
PlusEVAnalytics,how do i get one of those deals like they have in spy movies where if im dead by wednesday someone is directed to release it
PlusEVAnalytics,cc  who apparently enjoys meta-things. when poker players talk about developing a read on their opponents habits by observing their play they are mentally creating meta-distributions.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah i find it hard to buy that. if you can predict future line movement that accurately you should be making bets n overtime taking them.
PlusEVAnalytics,to summarize closing line value implies + expected value but lack of closing line value doesnt necessarily imply lack of +ev. i can get with that.
PlusEVAnalytics,would kernel colo you are on peaches and cream corn follow a mixed bernoulli-beta distribution? or have i just spend too much time on tennis lately?
PlusEVAnalytics,if kd is far enough away that he gets ruled out 30+ hours before game time are we really that confident hes coming back at all?
PlusEVAnalytics,i dont think so...that implies (total a bet / total b bet) is independent of m. really that ratio should approach 0 as m approaches infinity.
PlusEVAnalytics,to extend that logic - there is an infinite supply of possible variables to be tested. therefore one can never prove that a market is efficient.
PlusEVAnalytics,the conce point  of efficiency is probabilistic in nature. if kc wins by 20 that doesnt necessarily invalidate the efficiency of a line of kc -1.5.
aluckyaday,will the 9.5 percent  hold scare a few in vegas. maybe there is something in this so free throw  book model a free throw er all
aluckyaday,do you think leaving the eu with strengthen the union? personally i believe that if we leave it will be the end of it. ironic really!
aluckyaday,i guess it also depends how biased the public money is. is it big enough in one direction to offset the sharp money on the other.
aluckyaday,ok i'll continue to try and educate you. how do you set you stake at the moment? do you use a bank? do you use kelly?
aluckyaday,i've found a nice way to learn about overfitting. try to create a machine learning model from data that is n overtime in any way predictive
theFirmAISports,its interesting to note that teams between +2.5  -2.5 have the largest error with this type of modeling even tho there is a substantial sample size
theFirmAISports,"taking down the mlb postseason ball! excellent investigative reporting  killin it! this type of call out using deep dive analysis brings joy to my heart!

joeytunes2,i had al overtime of tricks pulled on me in my days. like different line sets for different players. erasing bets that won or were winning.
joeyisaks,ya as soon as sports are announced back itll feel like a sense of normalcy and financial markets should start to rebound same time .... maybe
joeyisaks,ok wow th against the spread the motivation i need i think il keep you posted on the results send you a video of my progress
joeyisaks,they dont need the best players to switch from pph to legal  / theyre banking on converting fans into new gamblers and sucking their money dry
joeyisaks,nfl season is fun. already lost 3 accounts and games havent started yet  pph agents really scared of beating a line by 1  point  these days
joeyisaks,this is the worst dra free throw  class in years/ ever .. he coulda lost a leg l assit night and would still be top 15
joeyisaks,reminder to everyone joey will be headlining guest tonight on a 15 year olds podcast. gotta start somewhere! any questions you want answered insert in reply
joeyisaks,yankees to me all l assit year was never gonna beat red sox.. now i think yankees are by far 1 assit ros 2 sox 3
EdMillerPoker,"this is a new poker-based esport designed by someones whose game design thoughts about online poker and gaming i have long admired.

definitely worth a look."
EdMillerPoker,there are some good betting spots in-play for preseason nfl games. check out o you are opinions live tonight and compare it to what's out there.
EdMillerPoker,quote  is a . its the primary way to signal boost on the platform. dont quote  garbage just to argue with it or dunk on it.
EdMillerPoker,every blue check with 100k followers now dunking on the guy just to make sure theres no sports fan in america who doesnt know his name
EdMillerPoker,yes the key is the conversion between the bets at the different point spreads. you need a model of some sort to convert between the two.
EdMillerPoker,"first visit to las vegas 20 years ago fell in love with how anyone can make it here with their brain and some hustle.

still true."
EdMillerPoker,there always seems to be plenty of money in convincing smart people to give you money on the promise that you will correct/exploit said inefficiency however
EdMillerPoker,but what you're seeing are many people who  daily fantasy sports  actually win getting limited and banned as well  it is  n overtime o point imal
EdMillerPoker,game design principles apply to all this stuff. industry already 9 figures deep shoveling money into products that ignore game design and they just can't quit.
EdMillerPoker,should be a requirement of any journo planning a breathy piece about the limitless potential of machine learning to first have to compile tensorflow from source
GolcondaFund,"lol boy toy? 

so prefer 3rd grade school yard ad hominem vs sophisticated money making?

alright seabiscuit.

GolcondaFund,"sunday night immediate recap and  years old you are first look at next week's nfl lines.

GolcondaFund,how is dealing with family/hurricane a free throw ermath going to affect players coaches tw? texans g overtime toasted. jags next? even to open + bortles..
GolcondaFund,such interesting game of momentum switches. mich looked like better coached team bigger o-line. gators gi free throw ed points. st against the spread out window...?
nonrandomalpha,crush possibly the worst team the nfl has ever seen then squeak by arguably the second worst team - nice. looking promising.  next stop afc championship.
LeeSharpeNFL,the chiefs at a high wp run less than other teams at that wp yes? i suspect this would account for much of the top gap.
LeeSharpeNFL,i'm kind of upset adam gase managed to be good enough to make my nyj under 7 wins +120 only push instead of being a win.
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  follow basketball either but i'll give them credit they understand 3  2. football is still trying to learn 7  3 + 3.
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is exactly how i felt about the 2018 bears.

the difference is you have more reasons to be o point imistic next year at least!"
LeeSharpeNFL,"here is  paper from the previous big data bowl on classifying route trees.

next week he will be starting a new job with the cleveland browns."
LeeSharpeNFL,i think you're probably right but i think the panthers would be dumb to do so (and this gurley contract is good evidence as to why).
LeeSharpeNFL,"bears 2020 opponents:

det x2 gb x2  minutes x2
atl car no tb
hou ind jax ten
lar
either nyg or was likely whoever wins tomorrow"
LeeSharpeNFL,also as someone with add exercise can be challenging i need to do this from time to time. people are super judgmental for no real reason.
LeeSharpeNFL,"nfl/nbc decline to flex chiefs/bears out of sunday night football for week 16.

one more chance for trubisky to have a terrible game on national tv."
LeeSharpeNFL,thanks! if you're interested the r code for creating them is here including determining which plays to label how to label them and the whole display:
LeeSharpeNFL,agreed but that would move it at best to neutral in my mind.  point about the the model handling angular data better makes sense to me.
LeeSharpeNFL,as much as i want bad things to happen to the green bay packers' record this seems like a bad plan for the niners to me.
LeeSharpeNFL,wow tanking would be a l overtime more prominent if the first team could just take play action and nobody else was allowed to run it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"top futures lines according to my model:

hou to win afc south -160
dal to win nfc e assit +105
sea to win nfc west +175"
LeeSharpeNFL,i've bet on the titans this year and i've bet against the titans this year and i feel like i'm still always on the wrong side.
whale_capper,i think tomorrow we're doing a video to break down the draw i'll tweet the link if you want to watch live and ask questions etc
whale_capper,deep dive into nfl analytics with  we discuss the data driven revolution and + expected value football in a fascinating ho you are long conversation. enjoy!

whale_capper,fair point im cool on the #4 pick and high on how important playoff experience is and th against the spread coloring my perce point ion
whale_capper,1st round of the group stage for the women's world cup is in the books... check out this very nice thread for a summary including xgs:
whale_capper,back of the envelope math... dubs up 3-2 with kd have an 83 percent  chance to advance... dubs up 3-2 no kd ~58 percent  to advance
AndyMSFW,"hump day six pack for me
   notes:
1. is delaware state the new pepperdine?
2. two of these are conference matchups!
3. i bet a favorite"
AndyMSFW,i changed the column headings to clear things up.  that is the price (in decimal) for the point spread i bet earlier to help me compare.
AndyMSFW,if anything you should be able to throw a flag on duck for that pass.   that is  how you get  years old you are guys killed.
AndyMSFW,didn't add anything to this yet looks like just the 5 plays for today. played some baltimore -3 -118 at lowvig for tomorrow just now though.
AndyMSFW,unless this means i have to pay back the book on my 12/1 stros ticket from that season then i  daily fantasy sports  really care.  #takeitbackbyanymeansapparently
AndyMSFW,if this defense is n overtime as good as previously thought i guess i'd be very concerned about only scoring 3 points at home vs them.
AndyMSFW,all my teams are doing very bad tonight which is just never fun.  i guess i'll take some solace in umbc + whoever wins the nec.
AndyMSFW,"l assit one i swear

JoeyKnish22,have a  college football  team total i really like this week will discuss with nick and joe call it the knishwich lock of the week .
JoeyKnish22,yeah i took a little bit. was hoping it would reopen +7 a free throw er pack primetime with over dallas but never g overtime there.
JoeyKnish22,if you see a mexican guy named shayne selling churros outside of wrigley and he gives you an nfl bet tip take the other side large.
JoeyKnish22,that fuck be against the spread me on h overtime dogs now shaving 40c off my golf tails. no wonder i hate going to the doctor.
TheKostos,i couldn't believe mullen kicked. so dumb. he made a two-score game a two-score game when 3 yards ends the game. but i appreciate it nonetheless
TheKostos,would have been better to fire both but ill take it! and also someone send the giants o you are venmo info for the lost bet
TheKostos,that field goal was so pathetic. making a two-score game a two-score game. lol. when ohio state gets the ball to start the second half!!! atrocious
TheKostos,dallas 100 percent  kicks here if maher makes the first two kicks. now they have to go for it and wont get it. rip the over
TheKostos,i bet yale +5 and they just sent it to  overtime on a late three. 100 percent  n overtime covering and i'm going to be apoplectic
TheKostos,people should be even more pissed at carroll and schotty today. imagine having a game plan so bad that you lost to this shitbag packers team
TheKostos,the ultimate gamblers lament is winning  years old you are vikings against the spread  wager but being pissed you didnt have the stones to go ml
LockyLockerson,very busy saturday of college basketball tomorrow.  full projections up at the patreon page which have been doing very well as the season has gone along!
LockyLockerson,i made a small bet on nebraska today and th against the spread it.  youre n overtime missing much but ill have some stuff for tomorrow.
LockyLockerson,hope you had some sandwiches or something delicious is the most awkward comment of the day in a day of hearings generally filled with awkwardness lol
LockyLockerson,"the ""carmelo is a complete disaster"" angle eluded me in the game and  that is  entirely my fault.  was staring all of us in the face."

LockyLockerson,i was 11 when they made the finals still remember where i was when nick anderson missed the free throws.  the brain is weird like that.
LockyLockerson,you think  years old you are night is going off the rails and then the reliable juggernaut that is the new york knicks bring you back

DannyParkins,pat mahomes insane highlight  touchdown  leads into a pat mahomes commercial on the nfl's premier broadc assit of the week. he's the face of the league.
DannyParkins,in fairness one of those int was l assit pass heave at end of the half but travis etienne definitely had the better heisman campaign game
DannyParkins,cant ask for a much better start to the #cubs season. if everyone overreacts to opening day this is the type of game you wanna have.
DannyParkins,go check out my guys  while i get a free throw er this moscow mule at an undisclosed alternate location and sweat this cincy -3.5 cover
DannyParkins,i am not. boarding a flight home a free throw er celebrating my anniversary in sedona. ill be back on  tomorrow with  filling in for mac.

chadmillman,the number of family members who have called me to talk about the weather makes me realize weather is a story everyone relates to. especially bettors.
chadmillman,hearing that  bought the flosports app to watch his liberty bet is the best example of why you have to listen/read/watch him. or pray for him.
chadmillman,turns out we  daily fantasy sports  need to play the next nfl season.  has already figured which 11 teams are the likely super bowl 54 winners.
chadmillman,hoping the fact we made everything  free today will put us all in a better place as we get over  college football  reg season being over.
chadmillman,have been testing these contests in beta the p assit week. so much fun answer the questions track results in o you are leaderboard super cool.

Gingfacekillah,step 2: you can now see the updated team elo ratings as well as expected point differentials and win percentages in the current elo ratings sheet.
Gingfacekillah,i expected a better defensive effort from was than this. unless we see bookers minutes clipped from a runaway game either way this is looking ugly.
Gingfacekillah,with no kevin durant tonight i'm forecasting hou having no problem taking care of this spread against gsw. also have a slight lean on the over.
Gingfacekillah,"off on the total but det puts the hurt on chi with a 23 point margin of victory.
forecasted: det -19.55 210.41
result: det -23 239."
Gingfacekillah,the pmv2 test continues: den at gsw:  looks like den and slight lean on the over. had to fix a calculation error from the original post.
Gingfacekillah,close loss on this one. adams had 11 a free throw er 2 q's. missed 3  free throw a's. finishes with 13  points  in 36 minutes.

logan_matthews9,as im currently and likely only temporarily tied for 1st i think the strategy remains taking value in the stale lines. pretty easy with todays game
logan_matthews9,zion roy +500 seems too high. ja definitely the front runner but i think 4 great months of zion wins over 6 decent months of ja
logan_matthews9,yeah but i dont think you are making the point you think you are... youre just describing variance which wasnt the point of the initial piece
PikachuBets,please address how you are claiming a full unit $300 record when you release  college basketball  extra games totals when bm/cris limits are still $250. frauds.
PikachuBets,"if someone sells mlb/nfl packages for $500 and actually bets those shitty plays at any meaningful level  that is  exactly what going ""full retard"" looks like"
PikachuBets,none of these assholes ever bet anything. you can dm them all day asking to book them and these pieces of chicken shit would never bite
PikachuBets,n overtime sure what youre bragging about. +400 on 14 percent  probability is still a terrible horrible bet. think you need to review math as well
PikachuBets,"is any of this english? besides where he admits to ripping off plays from ""smart people"" bc otherwise he wouldn't be able to bet anymore lol"

Ccon8181,detroit has been poor 1st half all year and  daily fantasy sports  like seattle with a lead. defense is n overtime the same as previous years
Ccon8181,haha 9-10 month of november-10 percent  only a degenerate gambler like yourself would lose his entire bankroll going 9-10. look long term +43 percent  y touchdown
Ccon8181,flew back to sd wednesday evening for thanksgiving i'll be back in vegas in 1 ho you are to get back to work. on the grind.
Ccon8181,can honestly say i can't remember having a 2 point  conversion go in my favor (for spread) ever. #steelers -3 this is going to be brutal
Ccon8181,instead of being down 8 at half #bills down 14. gonna need every point to cover this.  that is  n overtime going to get it done.
Ccon8181,"weekly recap: contrarian investments llc has big week like o you are fb page:

ToddFuhrman,won't argue that if those are the teams we see in the title game (and we most likely will) can see market opening right around pk
ToddFuhrman,lemon has to be the roster of 2 star recruits; n overtime sure its beating a power 5 opponent even in a 3rd tier bowl game
ToddFuhrman,going to be disappointed if kawhi heads back to toronto because fading the lakers all next season wont be as profitable as it could have been
ToddFuhrman,this is somehow an ejection in the biggest game of the series; if this took place in the superdome it would have been a no call
ToddFuhrman,going to be a l overtime of hoops fans on the e assit co assit waking up tomorrow wondering what the hell they missed tonight #lacvsgsw
ToddFuhrman,the fact that you were able to cash the  overtime bet in order for me to win my future was a small price to pay...nice hit
ToddFuhrman,the leagues are apparently of the mind set the best way to handle certain situations regarding sports gambling is to pretend they  daily fantasy sports  exist
TheCousinSal,"164 million for durant? hell they couldve signed me with two working legs for 100 million.

TheCousinSal,pete alonsos power is starting to become unfair. its only a matter of time before mlb forces him to use a wiffle ball bat. #letsgomets #polarpower
TheCousinSal,remember the days when the only leaks the raiders had to worry about were the ones al davis took in his parachute pants while napping? sad.
TheCousinSal,if theres a line on a big e assit team n overtime making it to the first weekend of the tournament im jumping on it. #bigyeastinfection

TheCousinSal,hilarious how excited the cowboys just g overtime a free throw er downing a punt inside the 5 with 15 seconds le free throw . dopes.
TheCousinSal,congrats! cant wait to see where they place you for the 2 years and 11 months a free throw er o you are show is cancelled.
TheCousinSal,we are watching two of the 5 or 6 worst teams in the league. a back door push would be totally fitting. # sunday night football
TheCousinSal,god bless this magnificent country. and while youre at it god...bless joey chestnut with the power to eat under 70.5 h overtime dogs today. #happyfourth #gambling
TheCousinSal,n overtime to pile on but this is pathetic. the ball goes like 3 feet. check out my profile pic. that is how its done sister!
TheCousinSal,another complicated thought - good things seem to happen when you make  years old you are free throws and layups. more hard-hitting analysis to follow. #finalfour
TheCousinSal,my best bet for tonight's michigan/texas am game has somehow come to life in animated video form. what a wild world we live in! #gambling #ncaatournament
TheCousinSal,funny to see guys signing autographs and eating popcorn on the bench a few minutes ago now diving for loose balls and screaming at refs. #allstargame
TheCousinSal,i feel like just by virtue of their routines that there are chargers cheerleaders who can kick better than what theyre currently putting out there. #lacvsoak
TheCousinSal,im n overtime as sure that nate sudfeld can bring the eagles a super bowl championship as i was when i woke up this morning. #cowboysvseagles
TheCousinSal,you cant blame the chargers defender for trying the scoop and score.  beating the browns by less than double digits is devastating to a teams psyche.
TheCousinSal,wow - that 3rd and 1 hand off call from shotgun to  years old you are rb with no momentum is a bad one urban meyer.
TheCousinSal,i can't believe  it is  been 2 years. i miss this guy so much. today  let us  all kick ass  chew bubble gum in his honor
TheCousinSal,so if the le free throw  cheek is down it counts as the entire rectum? i feel like a complete ass for never knowing this.  #balvsten
12Xpert,if there was anyway to measure this distribution of skill it would probably conform to a very strong power law something like this but much steeper.
12Xpert,and number of d expected points added rtures. does include some very short tenures (as little as one day) which arguably should n overtime be included.
12Xpert,i'll post it again. average odds 3.43. 10180 bets. expected -2.81 percent . chance of profit 3.32 percent . you really think i'm going too far?
12Xpert,it might be that the atp/way is efficient and is doubted by inefficient challengers and futures data. but i didnt drill down into the data here.
12Xpert,he might well although i suspect ego defence is a strong emotion and he'll o point  to rationalise it rather than admit it was a mistake.
12Xpert,makes perfect sense to me. marxism isnt popular with uk citizens. it never has been. the guardian is also pro remain and corbyn is pro brexit.
12Xpert,this little calculator can help you learn more about what range of possible performances you might reasonably expect. its probably much larger than you ever imagined.
JambosPicks,"for some reason o you are daily recap for 9/24/19 g overtime deleted so posting it again:

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,"this nolan arenado solo sh overtime made #rockies-#cardinals a 7-3 game meaning the over 9.5 is a winner weather permitting.

JambosPicks,well the under 6 (f5) is a winner but the #braves can't mount a comeback (yet) and trail the #dodgers 3-1 a free throw er 5.
mschwimer,haha. its a great platform. marc cuban stan druckenmiller and other bigtime people in finance are on it. i highly recommend if you enjoy finance content.
mschwimer,i am more than happy to set up a conference call to discuss if you are interested.  i think it will be enlightening.  but maybe not.
mschwimer,n overtime true. up +175 units vs. bookmaker. go to cumulative record. scroll to bottom. click the see record vs. bookmaker and close to see everything.
mschwimer,o you are history of over 2700 plays that are free and available to everyone doesnt count? even though o you are record significant better? ok
mschwimer,im n overtime sure similar is gonna cut it... i think i am just gonna have to say goodbye to curry food as a whole now.
mschwimer,if i do i do. if i dont i dont... i really dont think about it... all i can control is each individual pitch i make
RufusPeabody,closing line value is n overtime about how o free throw en the line moves  years old you are way magnitude is so so important.
RufusPeabody,you could fake it till you make it. the lines between charm vision bullsh*t and fraud have become so narrow as to be one line.
RufusPeabody,i was gonna say putting is the x-factor. chez and keego both n overtime great putters but when the putter is working they are dangerous
RufusPeabody,excited to have  and  on  this week to discuss their forthcoming book the logic of sports betting!  podcast should drop in the next few days.
RufusPeabody,um no it wasn't. it was a response to someone repying to samkon. ras quote retweeted it. it had literally nothing to do with ras.
RufusPeabody,it is  more of a pr issue than an actual issue. how do they make it right from a pr standpoint is the real question.
jeffma,jason witten just said these days in contr assit to deshaun watson and dak... does he realize that was literally less than 3 years ago
jeffma,yes. i would take the simplest solution which is a reputable book like westgate or cg offering a two sided market on gs to win
jeffma,1st world problem of the day: headed to a's/sox tonight but want to watch w's game also. anywhere in/near coliseum that will have w's game?
jeffma,immaterial. like talib diving to pick off geno smith to end the game but instead of staying down he gets up and scores a  touchdown
SportsCheetah,i already told you i was one of 2 +$ on best bets when they switched to espn2. feel free to prove me wrong there.
SportsCheetah,he was just running with the ball down the court a free throw er they g overtime the rebound it wasn'ta set play or anything
SportsCheetah,th against the spread how good graham has been. the hornets are still 4-2 over that stretch and won the 4 outright as an underdog.
SportsCheetah,yeah think he knows was just referring to daily wager today when i said i had it circled as a wait and play on 2h.
SportsCheetah,ulm going to miss a bowl thanks to missed p against the spread against fsu and just now against ull as massive underdogs in each.
SportsCheetah,did i tell you about the time i walked by a roulette table at bovada in vegas and saw........... 158 reds hit in a row?
SportsCheetah,man that late hit from troy at kelly bryants leg was pretty dirty. he probably wont be returning for anyone looking at betting the 2h.
capjack2000,"the ""oh what might have been"" award:
this entry had 12 picks remaining and only needed a very achievable 7-5 to finish in the money."
capjack2000,knicks start the 3q on a 15-0 run and the commentators are beside themselves. they keep checking the live line (which is close to pk).
capjack2000,this would be correct if the plugin utilized location services on  years old you are pc or phone.  that is  n overtime solely the case.
capjack2000,"pinnacle drop-down pricing is another example to know whether you're making a good bet buying numbers.

capjack2000,"more like one of those plants where they burn trash into steam.

capjack2000,nfl sides folks. if youre a bookmaker afraid to take more than one dollar on an nfl side you are in the wrong business bud.
capjack2000,"thanks im aware of the difference. 

the joke was the look on his face at having someone open up a briefcase with $3.5m in cash."
capjack2000,if  years old you are lines are off market for a half-ho you are you deserve to get destroyed. get better so free throw ware.
capjack2000,i haven't had any issues with their app so far. however i prefer to use the web-client on my pc when i do my betting.
capjack2000,"thescore app...

capjack2000,btw it was so good that i went and bought a print copy for my library despite having read the kindle version. it arrived today.
capjack2000,funny you bring that up.  (which operates ) is the only affiliate in nj that has been licensed to receive a share of players losses.
capjack2000,looks like the new  has a twitter feed right up on the odds board. if only  was around to see this... rip mayor of #gamblingtwitter
capjack2000,this is the first case that im aware of someone being removed from the involuntary exclusion list in pa. a list with over 1500 names.
capjack2000,i didnt nearly have the week you had but i did pick the 3 point  contest winner. probably playing the same pointsbet promo you were.
dinkinc,which is exactly what goes on today... people found it offensive if you kneeled during another simple song...president called them sob's and no one blinked
dinkinc,do you break it down before it goes in the box? i never have seen a colorless one. n overtime sure i could do one.
dinkinc,i know but sooner or later a horse will break down in a big race and the business will go on damage control once again.
dinkinc,being good at  years old you are cra free throw .  kind of actors in a fake movie. exce point  they do nothing athletic ..
dinkinc,there are going to be an awful l overtime of runs scored in baseball today...  perfect situations but  it is  mostly in the lines...tough racket
robpizzola,a free throw er watching all the star wars movies again i can definitively say that spaceballs is the best movie in the entire series.
robpizzola,you should think that way because there is an incredible amount of random variance when we are only looking at a 16 game sample size.
robpizzola,i cant wait for roger goodell to announce that myles garrett is getting suspended for the first quarter of next weeks game against the dolphins.
robpizzola,forg overtime about that. i have so much disdain for boston sports that i cann overtime bring myself to cheer for them in any capacity.
robpizzola,i dont think they have any regrets. bishop was arguably the best goalie in hockey this season but vasy is 24-years-old and already up there.
robpizzola,just in general but admittedly its largely because of the gambling aspect and n overtime wanting to be glued to a computer again all summer.

RASPicks,i'm n overtime calling you e-mailing you going on  years old you are forum doing  years old you are podc assit or giving you outs.
RASPicks,we have a user guide that addresses some of these issues.  we  daily fantasy sports  endorse specific books but you will need more than bovada.

VegasRefund,if  years old you are team needs a qb this offseason would you prefer them to sign a top fa or dra free throw  one?
ProfessorShine,overall i dont want to see top 2 teams have to play an extra game.   this current invitational format via committee is shit on rye.
ProfessorShine,beer in a cup.  also was some dumbass rule no gambling could exist within like 30yards of casino entrance. cant make this dumb shit up
ProfessorShine,ive made dozens of posts before legalization that nj needed sportsbooks to increase buzz\traffic.  latest numbers that  can provide show all casino revenue is up.
ProfessorShine,2:57 simmons give ball up at key goes down low ball goes to right wing to embiid simmons doesnt even try to post.   embiid stuck.
ProfessorShine,people forget 2016 virg made it to elite 8 and were up solidly vs orange.   they literally stopped playing hard and thought game was over.
ProfessorShine,but chase....according to action network sportsinsights etc one needs a solid w-l record to point that out. where is  years old you are w-l record??
suuma810,ok but my question is: is that a recognition thing play-call thing or aren't they allowed to adjust their route against this kind of coverage?
suuma810,"mike tomlin is looking to go 7-3 with mason rudolph  duck hodges as his starters.

i didnt expect that a free throw er week two."
suuma810,"should have stated that i was referring to the ""sound play on all three levels"" part. obviously they have guys with talent speed and athleticism."
suuma810,the los angeles #rams will find themselves in the toughest situation since sean mcvay arrived. read about it in my team preview exclusively for members:
suuma810,would like to see that. dunno if he can be a head coach in the nfl but would love to see him running an offense.
suuma810,the #chiefs offense is at 40.8 percent  dvoa.  that is  only 2.7 percent  lower than the 2007 #patriots. kc's pass dvoa is 7 percent  higher.
suuma810,the #packers were very fortunate to come up with a win here. kyle shanahan owned them for the most part with cj beathard at qb.
suuma810,"#patriots points against since 2010:

se point ember: 22.4 (22-9 su  18-13 against the spread )
october: 18.9 (29-6 su  22-12 against the spread )"
suuma810,no. prime example from l assit year: marshon lattimor and ken crawley were ruled out vs lar line didn't move during the first 12ish hours.
suuma810,it is  only week 2 - still enough time to sign up at  to get detailed analysis  picks throughout the nfl season! get on board
ClevTA,when u have the man responsible for his hire still in the building proving what a mistake and disaster it was alignment isnt always there
ClevTA,recruiting? th against the spread n overtime why hes been successful trust me. he also was ol coach with the giants. he has nfl experience
ClevTA,the only time the steelers have moved the ball is throwing deep so they come out with a brilliant run run to start a drive
ClevTA,this indicates that they wouldve gone for two if they had a chance to win the gm at the end. its essentially the same thing
ClevTA,dont worry im positive the 2 missed p against the spread from tampa wont come back to haunt them at all. n overtime one bit
ClevTA,but when u include  years old you are preseason picks you are at le assit .500. please step aside and learn from the very best
ClevTA,since 1980 home favorites in non div gms on  thursday night football  are 14-14-4 in weeks 1-6 but 32-15-3 a free throw er week 6
ClevTA,i said a top o point ion n overtime the top o point ion. also looking ahead is almost as important than the current week
CizzlingSports,yeah i'm with you re: the wording of the first page. just showing that mike mike has claimed that more than that was actually done.
CizzlingSports,ok but it might have an effect on whether a sub actually wins or loses his/her own bets so  it is  n overtime wholly inconsequential

CizzlingSports,it is  bad that they were in there in the first place and inflated a record you cited to facilitate selling $3000 subscti point ions
CizzlingSports,"he's atrocious; has convincingly lost all 3 years he's sold picks.

and  that is  with using low-limit early week  college football  lines (sun night/mon lines)"
CizzlingSports,n overtime sure other than that these two going a free throw er each other is always entertaining like little kids arguing over who's dumber

ProfessorShine,if i were bungles this weekend id blitz as much as physically possible in as many disguised ways as possible. make it fun guys.
ProfessorShine,being ske point ical of salesman in a industry rife with fraud is somehow a negative?  any business should welcome this kind of scrutiny.
ProfessorShine,blocked me for being critical of bretts must follow sports gambling list that included rj.  seems theyd prefer i n overtime read their articles.
ProfessorShine,it was a muggy tues forec assit with possible rain in the area. a 20 percent  drop is n overtime uncommon in that situation.
ProfessorShine,im implying it is easier to beat sports vs. nfl sides yes.  i do agree there are other challenges to the those other sports
ProfessorShine,true on feet pics n overtime the female boundaries thing.  kelly took her cues from fuhrman who has a career pretending to be sharp
ProfessorShine,this fucking caveat em point or principle should absolutely n overtime apply.  but yeah youre probably right; im the dick for pointing it out.
ProfessorShine,any sports betting show should feature a sportsbook manager.  one from offshore  one from lv and maybe detail why offshore books arent really illegal.
ProfessorShine,funny cbs showed auburn winning conference in 85. that team had a nice run in that years tournament. lost in sw 16 to unc

suuma810,can anyone tell me why the steelers punt the ball with 18 seconds le free throw  on the play clock? the clock was running.
suuma810,"is brian schottenheimer calling plays for texas?

swing pass on 2nd  14
run on 2nd  15
run on 2nd  10
run on 2nd  8"
suuma810,"the #vikings finally have a run game but kirk cousins ranks dead-l assit in qbr a free throw er week two.

makes you think.."
suuma810,highly recommend this podc assit with  they touch on on some fundamental sports betting thought processes. the part about measuring success was really good.
suuma810,the #vikings now have the highest implied win total within the nfc north but they are still 3rd to win the division. odds from
suuma810,for what  it is  worth : l assit year's normalized pinnacle win totals from 08/20 had a sum of 260.7. the under was 17-15.
suuma810,wenn er sich querstellt sitzt er doch eher auf der bank als anders. warum sollten die cards das mitmachen und ihn unter wert traden?
suuma810,the browns offense has been good under new oc freddie kitchens but they played three weak defenses. interesting how they approach the texans defense.
suuma810,the #49ers are on pace for a -34 turnover margin on the season. the 2017 #browns were at -29. should see some regression soon.
ClevTA,damn. the ravens are now #1 in both offensive dvoa rushing and passing. can't recall that happening this late in a season before. impressive
ClevTA,welp i hit the same teaser an ho you are ago. also indy/zona. watt strip sack to win by 10 on the way lol
ClevTA,my model has this boise game total at 71 so lots of value. guess u never know how hawaii performs away from the island
ClevTA,thanks to everyone who gave me mlb advice. i hit n against the spread -1.5 +256. i'll have to roll that over for gm7
ClevTA,th against the spread my guess and then if true is success rate more predictive than  expected points added  since turnovers  rz efficiency regress?
ClevTA,i agree. i wasnt saying the lakers wouldnt be very good just that l assit night on its own the clipps shouldve been favored
ClevTA,tremendous. hey  now i officially know im wrong for saying they shouldve gone for 2. u and stugotz on the same side is formidable
ClevTA,yeah they were #1 in the nfl in success rate with 12 under freddie. if higgins doesnt play they def do more 2 te

spanky,absolutely not. the bookmakers that attem point  to use my felony as an excuse n overtime to book me simply cant handle the action.
spanky,so theyll make sure theyll get it right for 63 games but n overtime worry about the thousands of games played prior... makes sense
spanky,yes you are correct. syracuse has it correct in their website. however ncaa needs to change it on their website. any help is appreciated
spanky,my limits this morning at  nfl 40k/10k cf 20k/6k nba 10k/4k cb 6k/2k....    my limits now nfl 5k/2k cf 2k/1k nba 500/300 cb 500/300

DocBettor,okay i moved the line from -195 to -270 on the one offshore i have offering it but think  it is  still worth it
PlusEVAnalytics,youre very good at what you do and youre obnoxious as fuck. i cant see how any sane person disputes either of these things.
PlusEVAnalytics,for win/place/show bets the winnings are expressed per $2 bet. they get rounded - always down never up - to the nearest 20 cents.
PlusEVAnalytics,for the 3 days between the time his models get good and the time everyone copies them hes gonna have the l assit laugh
PlusEVAnalytics,hedging is a great way to reduce risk. you know wh against the spread an even better way to reduce risk? n overtime betting.
PlusEVAnalytics,gruden deserves this for that 4th  1 punt. idiotic on a good day but trading possession for field position against kc is doubly idiotic.
PlusEVAnalytics,wh against the spread he gonna say though? were n overtime going to run that much again it was a one sh overtime deal?
PlusEVAnalytics,if you can hit 58 percent  vs closing lines the supercontest is a very poor use of  years old you are time and resources.
PlusEVAnalytics,i havent listened to this ep yet but this doesnt seem like that difficult a question? the binomial distribution should get you close enough...
PlusEVAnalytics,ive been in a similar situation. selling picks is n overtime the answer. take on partners work for syndicates etc. but dont sell picks.
PlusEVAnalytics,"hey guys what if we take sports betting and remove all the aspects that make sports betting attractive to people?
yeah lets do it!"
PlusEVAnalytics,yes. its actually a famous case in canadian tax law. gambling winnings are n overtime taxable unless you are in the business of gambling.
PlusEVAnalytics,theyd have to be advanced enough to spy on us but n overtime advanced enough to n overtime get caught. p small window there
PlusEVAnalytics,poisson model of  free throw /2p/3p at each players historical average distribution scaled to a median of 30.5 for steph and 8.5 for seth
PlusEVAnalytics,velocity and acceleration n overtime in any of the data sets ive ever seen. youd have to extrapolate from the split times (good luck)
PlusEVAnalytics,20 of my 21 bets so far have been unders. either my model is miscalibrated or the market is. id put it at 50-50.
PlusEVAnalytics,wow who could have ever predicted that this would be the consequence of raising the minimum wage by 20 percent ? oh yeah everyone.
aluckyaday,i thought it was the other way round. the one released on tv and reinforced by farage was wrong. the private ones were correct.
aluckyaday,when it comes to sports betting i would say the opposite is true! to create liquidity you need to increase the number of losers.
aluckyaday,i was going to say restrict who you follow until i looked at  years old you are profile! i thought i was being selective!
aluckyaday,secretly hoping it continues now. want to get that figure to a 1 in a million event a couple more days should do it!
aluckyaday,unless of course you try and use this knowledge and only bet kambi when they are better then pinnacle. quick way to stake reductions.
aluckyaday,from who? boris? the labor party activist? or both? this is what uk politics has become. a battle of fake news. its very sad
aluckyaday,they will take more than $33 on it just n overtime from bettors they think will n overtime be profitable for them long term.
aluckyaday,n overtime convinced. maybe if they made it look more like a sports book without the lay price. like smarkets is trying to do.
aluckyaday,if you change something a free throw er 1 result then i would have though changing a free throw er 20 was a given.
aluckyaday,better than expected results or is everyone just so excited because they are going to be able to watch love island twice a year!
aluckyaday,just shows what the conservative party has become if they really believe bumbling boris is the best o point ion to lead the country!
aluckyaday,if you send them a data protection request or whatever it is called now you can usually find the exact reason for being restricted/closed
joeytunes2,clemson plus 6 for  years old you are lungs. everyone keeps doubting. i have them a pk. already took a bad number at  4.5
joeytunes2,"i use to have guys.""use"" theres still a 2 well respected guys in the industry that does his own stuff. moves there own lines."

joeyisaks,i dont have any followers haha can  pick ask yours how long i have at betonline til they stop letting me bet their openers
EdMillerPoker,yeah i dislike that marketing. some of it is ok i think but that parlay patz stuff was really across the line for me.
EdMillerPoker,whether someone is a winning sports bettor or n overtime is entirely a function of how strong the trading is on the other side
EdMillerPoker,like i think huds in poker were waaaaay more questionable when they first came out than what you're describing for  daily fantasy sports .
EdMillerPoker,daily fantasy sports  gaf what yall do and i doubt rufus does either. he and i just  daily fantasy sports  want that imported here.
EdMillerPoker,sports betting is a game. entertainment is the only purpose. the people who build the best most fun most customer-experience focused games will win.
EdMillerPoker,its funny how disru point er has become a positive word. breaking shit is easy. its the rebuilding part th against the spread hard.
EdMillerPoker,"step 1. hire a l overtime of expensive engineering talent with little or no sports or gambling experience.

step 2. ...

step 3. profit."
EdMillerPoker,if you make ppl login to unsub  years old you are email list you are a bad person and you should be feel bad
EdMillerPoker,fair enough. glad you liked the book overall. thanks man for reading it and putting so much thought into  years old you are feedback.
EdMillerPoker,thanks for taking a sh overtime on it everyone.  it is  a good read and i'm proud of it. hope y'all like it too.
EdMillerPoker,amazon has different preorder rules for kindle vs paperback. trying to get paperback preorder up asap. n overtime sure what eta is on it.
EdMillerPoker,i more or less just described poker and i think the fact that it adheres to these principles is what's made it so enduring
EdMillerPoker,so many people who work in and around gambling dont actually seem to be interested in the game stuff. dont understand this at all.
EdMillerPoker,this is gonna happen for sure. also an indirect reason operators should be planning with a symbiotic relationship with the leagues in mind imo.
EdMillerPoker,if you aren't downloading and printing out random shit from the internet to sell for six figs at art auctions are you even trying?
nonrandomalpha,lol did you delete  years old you are tweet touting the saints? th against the spread n overtime how this works yung billy walters
nonrandomalpha,many people complain about a generation they are n overtime a member of; get over it. all generations have their pros and cons. period.
nonrandomalpha,#fitzmagic would make wk1 +4.5 look a l overtime more attractive and the #ravens on the road as heavy chalk a non-starter for me...
LeeSharpeNFL,"real talk though i've disliked how broad the ""no_play"" label in nflscrapr is so glad i have at le assit begun to address this."
LeeSharpeNFL,as in if you kneel in the very back of the end zone. if you run it out you have to run those yards.
LeeSharpeNFL,"me: maybe this will be a normal seahawks game  it is  starting to look like one.

seahawks: ha ha ha ha you doubt us"
LeeSharpeNFL,nagy has n overtime done well on scri point ed plays so far this year but they're looking a l overtime better this game.
LeeSharpeNFL,it might be even worse: mitch trubisky and david blough the latter of which i'm n overtime sure i had heard of before today.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i will take it!

unfortunately i was 4 years old n overtime watching football so i still haven't experienced a championship n overtime really."
whale_capper,yeah im looking at a current kc number that is 5  points  higher than when mahomes returned and theyre still ~3  points  behind bal
whale_capper,i  daily fantasy sports  entirely understand prop limits but they may have un-circled one at customer request and now everyone has access to it
whale_capper,he didnt look like he was moving especially well of course neither did klay but who knows with the games spaced out so far
whale_capper,deep dive into positive expected value with  to explore some fascinating topics like finding an edge efficiency of markets and originating in-play angles enjoy!
whale_capper,close game favors an under plus getting a pretty long tail of bucks blowout which would turn the 4q into a 40 point stinker
AndyMSFW,obviously n overtime this late on a saturday!  le free throw  a message with the recruiter hopefully figure out where basic is on monday.
AndyMSFW,honestly  that is  just a genius move to use jamies' willingness to throw the ball to a defender on that play call to vea.
AndyMSFW,i think there's an easy joke in there about kentucky-folk n overtime having to worry about their teeth getting knocked out during the game.
AndyMSFW,"wr trade rumors update:
we're over here fumbling like an 8th grader at his first make-out party and this mfer is playing 8-d chess"
AndyMSFW,"forg overtime to actually do a st jude recap.  it was meh.

AndyMSFW,tough call with some of these that might get a bit juicy but you can always flat bet them instead of laying extra dough.
AndyMSFW,"pebble beach three ball

AndyMSFW,no model plays today i'll check into tomorrow's stuff in a bit.  double check  years old you are brackets and good luck today! #marchmadness
JoeyKnish22,you should worry about getting the bo overtime from the bowl pool for calling it the wrong name before worrying about a middle here.
JoeyKnish22,"payout structure as follows:

JoeyKnish22,every thanksgiving table in america is going to have at le assit one relative with a cowboys/saints teaser. if n overtime the entire family.
JoeyKnish22,i like the full game better tbh hopefully miami puts in the white kids when its 38-0 4q and we get a  touchdown .
JoeyKnish22,im n overtime sure those curtains go well with the beige couch if this hits would consider swapping those out for something more neutral.
JoeyKnish22,"*pretends to be shocked*

JoeyKnish22,i just need them to turn off the juice to the damn website. maybe rename it. idc. company can still exist. website gotta go.

JoeyKnish22,i went to bed at hal free throw ime. and he threw for 400 yards and lead an all timer in the 2h lmao
JoeyKnish22,i think in the end theyd just force barcelona to pay more money instead of forcing him back to atltico. would be my guess.
JoeyKnish22,lol yup id say l assit years colts sauce was mostly (maybe completely) financially driven. po you are one out for 25/1 division futures.
TheKostos,that is so bad from olave. ohio state really had no business losing this game. so many dumbass errors from both coaches and players
TheKostos,out of all the possible ways to lose in week 16 i didnt expect both watson and winston busting to be one of them
TheKostos,consider my (minor/early) opposition here an attem point  at balancing the force as the universe is n overtime pleased that pizzonish have joined forces
TheKostos,good news i played brissett in the milly. bad news i played him with campbell and doyle and some dude named johnson just scored
TheKostos,few things in football are more awesome than belichick holding court with the defense a free throw er they g overtime their asses kicked
TheKostos,the nfl sides variance has been ludicrous this season. id kill for a 3-2 week lol. i cant deal with 5-0 followed by 0-5
TheKostos,i am no longer sure ill be betting on alabama in the iron bowl. i will be taking no questions at this time. tysm
TheKostos,if bucs/falcons goes under because of this slapdick matt gay i'm gonna do absolutely nothing but get really mad on twitter d overtime com

LockyLockerson,if youre looking for nba link its now in my profile.  doubt anyones buying the college football guide much anymore since its halloween lol.
LockyLockerson,on the show friday i think  was trying really hard n overtime to say you are an idi overtime for betting on this team
LockyLockerson,this seems like a really good college basketball season for me to take off.  scandals on the horizon everywhere.  see ya in march sport!
LockyLockerson,all of those things are part of the reason i have n overtime really formed an opinion of them. all kinds of dicey areas.
LockyLockerson,also the number of people hoping sterling brown comes in to play like 2 minutes tonight so they cash their unders must be staggering.
LockyLockerson,i think its possible and em point y arenas are more likely.  no indications this is slowing or even staying the same.  only escalating.
LockyLockerson,"today's daily bump!

Ccon8181,he is running through the conference. even with langford out which i thought would be an issue they are n overtime keeping games close.
Ccon8181,probably came back a little strong. difference of opinion. either way the vikes won and more importantly covered. gl the rest of the way.

12Xpert,at the scale of everything by definition there must be full efficiency because the probability of something happening is 1 and something always happens.
12Xpert,that is  interesting. in which case that would be an argument for using different xg algorithms depending who's taking a sh overtime wouldn't it?
12Xpert,rightly or wrongly we appear to be returning to a world where it is assumed you are n overtime to be trusted with yourself.
12Xpert,theres little point in holding a referendum if parliament will never agree to one of the outcomes. democracy is more than just parliamentary law.
12Xpert,888 ladbrokes coral are two examples that spring to mind or large fines. sporting index have just had an ad banned by the asa.
12Xpert,life is full of risk and uncertainty. anything that equips us with tools better able to handle those things is surely a positive force.

RufusPeabody,new   podcast where  and i discuss nfl week 17 and how its a different animal. we also go over next mondays bowl games.
RufusPeabody,if the redskins had dra free throw ed lamar jackson he would probably be a bust. th against the spread the redskin way.
RufusPeabody,re-read the wording of my original tweet. british open is considered a european to you are event ( that is  the primary tour).
RufusPeabody,finau won in puerto rico. it may n overtime have been a strong field but it was a pga to you are event.
RufusPeabody,...yet people continually make inferences based off of small/non-random samples. understanding randomness is perhaps the most important skill to being a winning bettor.
RufusPeabody,people who are allowed to fire big like this are most assuredly *not* sharps. they are rich businessmen who give big casino action.
jeffma,really wasnt a dig at o you are audience. it was meant to be self deprecating humor about how inaccessible that segment was
jeffma,we try to redefine the word upset and discuss  wardrobe choices for burning man on the latest episode of  even a shoutout to
jeffma,that is  fair. i did appreciate that he played a slightly better set of rotations l assit night. but still too much waiters
jeffma,agreed. the decisions are bad but more troublesome is the explanation of the decisions both before and a free throw er the fact.
jeffma,can someone explain to me why coaching decisions in football should change depending on whether you are at home or on the road?
SportsCheetah,bahahahahaha i was having lunch with my kids just hadn't seen his tweet for awhile. i had to double-take the 0 likes though.
SportsCheetah,n overtime sure i actually bet against them with uw but fortunately have stayed away in other games... they've been on a roll.
SportsCheetah,they were via drop down to play an alt line but initial bets were at ohio st -9.5 -204 and nw -7 -146
SportsCheetah,i watch too many honestly cant recall. remember thinking it was interesting that they jumped it at mid court. may have been clippers-warriors.
SportsCheetah,i decided uga has just been pr expected points added ring for bama every week and showing up on saturdays to run scrimmages.

capjack2000,stadium already has a partner in unibet i believe. iirc wind creek has paid the license fee so they plan to offer it.
capjack2000,even the public companies mash together numbers and blend over 3 months. ive attem point ed a foia request. it has been denied.
capjack2000,the mattress mack inside story episode of gambling with an edge is really interesting. there's a part 2 that will drop later tonight.

capjack2000,don best is so messed up. they have 10-0 as the score of a mlb game in the top of the 1st. pathetic.
capjack2000,if youre betting standard straight bets and totals youll have no problem. if youre playing derivatives or props youre going to get limited.
capjack2000,"the trend of nj sportsbooks getting extremely picky continues.

capjack2000,i  daily fantasy sports  know. i wish they'd say. there could be many different valid and invalid reasons why they would prohibit it.
capjack2000,funny how these techniques are only used on withdrawals. their kyc duty only seems to kick in when they need to pay winners.
capjack2000,i noticed  now allows you to view lines and odds without logging in. good move. overdue but at le assit  it is  done.
capjack2000,"i think it was called ""dream season"" or something close to that. i've never found video of it either (but haven't really looked)."
capjack2000,ill be happy to no longer have to explain why sugarhouse online casino is in nj and the physical casino is in pa.
capjack2000,good question as to whether  years old you are limits carry over from nj despite never having played there? seems like unfair profiling.

robpizzola,thanks knish. means a l overtime coming from a guy that sees all the angles but doesnt have the balls to play them.
robpizzola,finally g overtime to eat at alo in toronto tonight. hands down the best dining experience i have ever had. would highly recommend.
robpizzola,find me a sp overtime where i can parlay redskins exactly 0 points with raiders exactly 0 points and i might bet it.
robpizzola,you should really be mad at the people who watch similar shows to you that decided they were going to watch the i-land!

robpizzola,watching you try to talk yourself into this being ok is some of the best comedy ive seen on here in a while.
robpizzola,daily fantasy sports  really have one if i'm being honest. go-to album for me right now is phanerozoic i: palaeozoic by the ocean.
RASPicks,so  evaluated everything you were doing and agreed this was the best path to take with  years old you are information? truly epic.
RASPicks,2) the average ras subscriber consistently gets within a point of the release line.  doing that has won at 56.6 percent  l/6 years.
RASPicks,none of the records in this tweet include  college football  extra plays.  we haven't even won on those the p assit 3 years.
RASPicks,as i responded to another follower it is as simple has having iowa rated higher than tennessee by a margin higher than spread.
RASPicks,i'd love to falsely accuse you or a pregame pro of taking a lucrative private deal but no one would ever believe it.
RASPicks,we have to make split second decisions and it wasn't as clear cut as you are suggesting.  pinn  bo technically we're at 10.5.
RASPicks,the closing line on any sort of consistent basis.  the goal is to always beat the close n overtime play against it. (2/2)
RASPicks,with all of the various start times it would hard to be consistent with anything manual.  much better to have automation for it.
RASPicks,has n overtime giving a warning before each play made it easier or harder to get release numbers on wnba plays?  discuss:  .co/o2bwg6c

suuma810,how is that a touchdown? his fo overtime hits the ground a free throw er the knee was already down out of bounds.
suuma810,cant give a mathematical estimate but i think about n overtime more than 10 percent . kc likely two games ahead  getting healthy.
suuma810,imagine having tyler lockett josh gordon  dk metcalf but a coaching staff that wants to take the ball out of russell wilsons hands.
suuma810,but they gotta feed melvin gordon for -0.60  expected points added  per rush (30+ runs dead-l assit by a mile) on the ground.
suuma810,"if i convinced you  you want to get on board sign up here: 

if you have any questions feel free to dm me!"

suuma810,cool interview with  introducing the new  app that merges sports betting  social media. implementation of closing line value is also in their plans.
suuma810,if you have some time to kill go read 1400 words about the consensus worst team in football - my miami #dolphins preview:

deshaun watson  friends have some hurdles to overcome this year.."
suuma810,exactly! if you bet the dog on the  moneyline its a loss. on the spread its a push. difference between pushing and losing.
suuma810,winston ist drei jahre lter und die bucs picken an 5. abgesehen davon ist und bleibt der dra free throw  weitestgehend ein dartspiel.
suuma810,wollte bpa mit need verbinden. besonders ab 6/7 aufwrts wurde es fr mich tricky. htte auch noch andere in die top-10 nehmen knnen.
suuma810,the #seahawks seem to be well-pr expected points added red when playing the #raiders at wembley tomorrow. read my write-up on the game:
suuma810,rush dvoa vs top. rush dvoa only explains 3 percent  of the variance in top. rush efficiency has almost no impact on top.
suuma810,agree. when the score was 17-3 it could have been 17-17 though. turnovers made the difference obviously. sf also killed themselves with drops.

spanky,disagree. they did a whole marketing campaign on how they will take everyone on and they are n overtime the typical recreational bookmaker.
spanky,the crazy language of the wire act is it states business of betting which later had to be clarified (citations above)  as bookmaking.
spanky,"huge difference. 

with touting the pick seller will make money regardless of results. 

with betting partnerships both parties will lose and win together."
spanky,with the experience you have rex im n overtime surprised at all you would land at a solid sp overtime like  congratulations brother.

PlusEVAnalytics,yes. so we have a choice we can reflect that uncertainty in o you are decisions or we can pretend it doesnt exist.
PlusEVAnalytics,implies something close to pk for game 7 doesnt it? that momentum / team of destiny narrative getting a l overtime of run...
PlusEVAnalytics,recency bias and loss aversion...compare the mood today to what it would have been if theyd lost game 4 and won game 5.
PlusEVAnalytics,of course the kid probably meant im n overtime a boy im a big man but people hear what they want to hear
PlusEVAnalytics,for what  it is  worth  i had a tiny edge on the dallas under and nothing else when i checked l assit night

aluckyaday,recreational betting is n overtime supposed to be appetizing to professional bettors. neither the state or the recreational bookmakers want or need them.
aluckyaday,i think he needs to rethink his wording in this one hopefully what he said is actually is n overtime what he meant!
aluckyaday,funny how people are biased against shorter prices. guess its because you are more likely to be profitable by chance at larger prices.
aluckyaday,many recreational sport players have expectation or hope of winning but if they play badly they have very little chance of doing so.....
aluckyaday,you do know that the answer to a twitter poll no matter what the actual question is will be the most popular guy
aluckyaday,shows like this are aimed at the recreational bettor who are betting for entertainment n overtime profit. their utility is different to yours
aluckyaday,the only value in sharps is to give you the number but you can buy that in cheaper. or just look at pinney
aluckyaday,probably because with gambling there is an easy target. these days we would struggle without shops but could probably get by without bookmakers.
aluckyaday,sorry prices have changed before i could get the bet up. will update the site now but now shorter than i would like
aluckyaday,i believe 20 wins against the spread  in a row is about a 1 in a million event! seems pretty significant to me.
aluckyaday,look at the work of  . his books are great but a l overtime of his work is also  available online here  and
aluckyaday,actually so free throw  books are quite important as they are how pinnacle gets access to the recreational money that feeds everyone else.

joeytunes2,we always would watch the fights. how much better was hockey. of all the changes to sports. nhl became the worse. then nfl.
joeytunes2,allt of teams should but  that is  why i bet them all playoffs. if i cant get a ring i'll buy a rolex.
joeytunes2,"this is n overtime a business where you rob people of thousands. (says the bookie) hahah ....and this isnt bovada. ""crying right now"""
joeytunes2,only g overtime 1 acct today. so i can't give free winners.. someone step up # feed me  #square #sharp #jus touchdown oit
joeyisaks,if this is  years old you are worst day  you are lucky i feel like i have 0-7 or worse every few days
joeyisaks,look at their schedule next season... n overtime worth throwing a first year coach into that just let helton suck one more year
joeyisaks,heres to hoping cody gets names mvp today. good luck cody. was 34-1.  pic n overtime posted is trevor bauer cy young bet
joeyisaks,fair enough - hes said jambo is an acronym for 6 people who make models... but why dont they bet these plays then?
joeyisaks,because you cant gamble from stadiums but can from couch with 10 games on. and going to a game takes up all day
joeyisaks,smart by new jersey to slide this in so they can book the election which would be more bet on than super bowl
EdMillerPoker,this feels a bit idealistic to me but broadly i agree. lowering barriers to entry seems the most concrete way to improve things.
EdMillerPoker,could do the same for baseball also now that i think about it. would be a fun thing to roll out in april.
EdMillerPoker,shout out to all the podc assit producers out there who cant be bothered when the hosts say can you edit this out?
EdMillerPoker,lg xp make  percent  this season is within half a percent of my preseason projection.  field goal  make  percent  is right there too.
EdMillerPoker,every single person (bettor/book/exec/etc) i've come across has huge gaps in their understanding of the sports betting industry. less talking more listening imo.
EdMillerPoker,there's some steps in there between collect underpants and profit but basically yeah. feel like there's a l overtime of evidence for it.
EdMillerPoker,just received a 10 percent  off coupon as my compensation in a class action settlement. apparently getting sued is a marketing opportunity now.
EdMillerPoker,there are two kinds of people in the world people who liked bernies rent control tweet ironically and people who liked it unironically
EdMillerPoker,i think mit has sent me more emails in the p assit two weeks than they had in the 20 years before that
EdMillerPoker,"we have the saints covering the pregame line -6.5 about 11.1 percent  from here.

and then we have 3 different totals as well."
EdMillerPoker,"i mean  that is  the idea but nowadays i see the breaking part celebrated as ""disru point ing"" before anything has been built"
EdMillerPoker,dont know but dont really care. highly biased sample there bc those who are affected just quit on the product bc it sucks.
EdMillerPoker,think it also matters a l overtime whether game is in primarily tourist or primarily locals market low vs high table  minutes etc
EdMillerPoker,absurdity is my favorite humanity and dunning-kruger is one of my favorite absurdities. so by all means carry on nutrition experts. carry on.
EdMillerPoker,til everyone on twitter is an expert in corporate structures operating sports leagues and sports gambling ip. honestly im just here to learn.
EdMillerPoker,yall take this into the ring will be my first ever ppv buy. u might be able to negotiate 1/500th of the purse.

LeeSharpeNFL,"""what team won by a l overtime with little offensive performance?"" is a good way to describe a l overtime of bears wins."
LeeSharpeNFL,qb wins is a dumb stat but eli retiring with as many wins as  losses is still in play and this amuses me.

LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  think  it is  insane to retain him but i would let him go. i expect him to be retained.

Gingfacekillah,you can definitely experiment with that - for example using the gssd model and replacing actual results with yards for/against ypp xg etc.
Gingfacekillah,good point. largely a game of good decisions. it doesnt take too many bad decisions to erase a significant amount of excellent work.
Gingfacekillah,sure you can. however if you have a xg model you might want to consider combining both in some kind of an ensemble
Gingfacekillah,thanks for  years old you are purchase! please let me know what you think. any questions or issues fire me a dm :)
Gingfacekillah,this test is for a player prop model that forec assits mean points scored for over under wagers. i was leaning towards mae.

12Xpert,error bars are almost always missing and where present are massively underestimated. we  daily fantasy sports  know what we  daily fantasy sports  know.
12Xpert,so that graph gradient should be 1 if closing prices are efficient. if it is less than 1 this implies they are not.
12Xpert,e1 e2 e3 ec and f2's next round playing monday/tuesday added. the remainder of midweek fixtures will be available usual time tuesday morning.

#falcons: 
#ravens: 
#panthers: 
#browns:"
suuma810,flacco szn?! the denver #broncos should be an improved team in 2019 but their ceiling is vastly limited. here's my team preview:
suuma810,the #cowboys offense finished 23rd in weighed dvoa. with travis frederick coming back and an innovative oc they should improve in 2019.
suuma810,i see people complaining about flags but the eagles were outgained by 245 yards in regulation. game shouldnt have went to ot.
ClevTA,philly opened -3 in some places but th against the spread a bad line. i have them -1/1.5 based on my rating
ClevTA,young was an inch away from a strip or sack at le assit 7-8 times. he was great but lawrence releases fast
ClevTA,since week 8 the packers (last) and vikings (31st) are the two worst run defenses based on success rate in the nfl
ClevTA,tried to tell u deez. u dont try and sign an xfl qb 3 days before a gm without there being trouble
ClevTA,any qb who can make ppl beg for flacco sounds bad.  it is  a battle between joe and lewerke for  right now
ClevTA,back to winning ways on  thursday night football . hopefully i dont have to back this crappy skins team again this year
ClevTA,when two role players hit 9-11 from 3 th against the spread n overtime close to sustainable no matter what lebron does
ClevTA,that arizona final score was misleading 2 missed  field goal s + a flukey tipped pick 6. wasnt a bad handicap tbh
ClevTA,59 percent  6.6 ypa 4  touchdown  4 int if u feel like excluding the bears game. those are still very poor numbers
ClevTA,yikes i would've advised to avoid him in the first 5 rounds. pick up higgins if available and if n overtime renfrow

PlusEVAnalytics,better than 50 percent  against the stale contest line exactly 50 percent  against the live line is my working assum point ion.
PlusEVAnalytics,the chart doesnt say theyre illegal. the chart says its a bad idea for someone to pay for picks. and it is.
PlusEVAnalytics,this is an abuse of the parimutuel system and its only standard because nobody has figured out what a crock it is.

aluckyaday,only effects people who bet in those 10 minutes but still they should n overtime be able to get away with it.
aluckyaday,so how long a period? how many wins in that period? what kind of return? just a gut feeling? or something measurable?
aluckyaday,what about the west co assit would then n overtime still be in bed? or do they n overtime count as americans
aluckyaday,i think the 20 wins in a row was just used to show how it works rather than something that normally happens.
aluckyaday,my impression of betfred is they tend to offer more value at the big meetings i.e. when the publicity is the greatest!
aluckyaday,that issue is addressed at the european council stage where votes are based on population sizes in the majority of policy areas.
aluckyaday,surely at some point in the next 3 weeks he has to screw up somewhere? it is boris a free throw erall

nonrandomalpha,is it just me or have all the smug defiant post-dolphins game lamar jackson bulls gone eerily silent the l assit month?
nonrandomalpha,that is  2-3 teams so consistent statements.  for what  it is  worth  i think seattle is overrated and misses playoffs. 7-8 wins.
nonrandomalpha,how about they couldnt stop chunk run plays even when they were specifically playing the run? nah? n overtime a material observation?
nonrandomalpha,true - but my point was that you can provide good content and at the same time n overtime provide good picks.
nonrandomalpha,"multi-sport total return fund:

LeeSharpeNFL,yeah you use the aes() wrapper around aesthetics where you're using that column in the main data frame attached to the plot!
LeeSharpeNFL,daily fantasy sports  understand how vikings only g overtime a field goal with all that momentum a free throw er the turnover.
LeeSharpeNFL,isn't this data available from nflscrapr? n overtime doing anything here that isn't public afaict (nothing wrong with using proprietary data though).
LeeSharpeNFL,"there is no consensus definition for ""properly"" this is part of why  it is  bad to make it able to be challenged."
LeeSharpeNFL,"sorry. we tried but o you are team is too bad.

 it is  on you to stop the packers now. good luck."
LeeSharpeNFL,"err i meant two years from two years ago (e.g. now).

though i expect rodgers will still be playing in 2 years."
LeeSharpeNFL,i would doink anyone on the heard who tried to double up on this and bring up bad  field goal  memories :(
LeeSharpeNFL,"you could artificially fix this by adding in some ""distance"" between l assit year and this year but.... how much and why?"
LeeSharpeNFL,rudolph the red nosed reindeer the  story which teaches the valuable lesson that differences will be mocked unless they can be exploited.
LeeSharpeNFL,i  daily fantasy sports  care about winning now. at this point  it is  about figuring out what moves to make this offseason.
LeeSharpeNFL,lafle you are may be better tan mccarthy but if the packers were looking for a game management savior he isn't it.
LeeSharpeNFL,"good thread!

also if you're interested in series conversion rate see my pinned tweet for code that adds series conversion data to"
LeeSharpeNFL,"this is an incredible statistic.

12Xpert,similarly for problem gambling correlating with vip/high roller status. i suspect however  that is  n overtime what the  has bothered to do.

12Xpert,yeah that is quite interesting. although i know n overtime to be fooled by variance even over samples as big as 10000.
12Xpert,remember in the long run if the market is right (trolls: enter stage le free throw  ) scores should regress to zero.
12Xpert,really fabulous debate about gambling. always pays to be able to refer to evidence based research when making moral judgements about it.

dinkinc,feel bad for the lions. totally beat by two horrible calls and a no call.  review everything or nothing at all
dinkinc,gave stale line and  years old you are to blame... you give touts a bad name... best for new jersey bettors
dinkinc,the yankees can dress their aa team and they will win every game...they have an interseting problem when everyone gets healthy

dinkinc,it is  fine....  it is  just a paul heyman thing..he is putting an original ecw flavor on raw... will be interesting
dinkinc,me too.... if i thought about it he had to have quads...i  daily fantasy sports  take enough time at the table
dinkinc,the punishment should be the same as if she did it to children at a sle expected points added way camp
dinkinc,somehow ended up at the drinkers hall of fame with  and his buds.  ordered a sprite and they kicked me out
dinkinc,1`-0 mlb.....     1-0 nhl   .... 4 consec but still reluctant to make baseball bets..... likely burnout but will get through it
robpizzola,did you only catch housley in the latter part of his career? this is an embarrassing tweet. you should delete it.
robpizzola,just looked at my edges for bowl games this year and i might just sleep through the entire bowl season fml
robpizzola,permanently. bookie is going to shatter my knee caps with a crow bar when i can't pay for this vikings loss.
robpizzola,yeah. youre going up against a team th against the spread punted one time in a month lol... have some balls.
robpizzola,i dont discriminate against gender. just feel like its the high school guys that are usually trying to game the system.
robpizzola,how can you say a team is awful on the road if theyve previously only played two road games this season?
robpizzola,ksu with the classic kick a field goal to turn a three-score game into a three-score game in the 4th quarter.
robpizzola,i'm hoping that somehow ab signs with the broncos plays against the raiders on monday night and scores 5  touchdown s.
robpizzola,i haven't g overtime one yet but  it is  entirely possible i will have one by sunday. i love this album.
robpizzola,in all seriousness cheetah actually g overtime that nickname for how quickly hell stick you with the bill at oyster bar.
robpizzola,its actually almost impossible to get rece point ion presumably because everyone is trying to do the same all at once.
robpizzola,pretty much the same one theyve ran all season. let the sh overtime clock wind down chuck up a contested shot.
robpizzola,i can assure you they were awake and friendly. caught them at a bad time from the looks of things lol
robpizzola,years old you are mother is definitely a better gambler slim. years of letting me slide in unprotected and still nothing.
robpizzola,"god i'm so bad at this.

a $100 parlay on columbus in 4 and islanders in 4 would have paid $90549."
RASPicks,it is  n overtime the first time o you are demise has been predicted.  i'm sure it won't be the last.
RASPicks,was asked earlier about handicappers we endorse/follow.  let us  turn the question. who do you think is worth paying attention to?
RASPicks,reminder get all week 1  college football  plays from ras for free.  sign-up here:  .  three plays already released this morning.
RASPicks,o you are markets are much bigger and fezzik (pretty much anyone) hasn't hit similar long term win rates this decade.
RASPicks,it definitely has been profitable l assit 5+ years but will it continue to be going forward is a different question.
RASPicks,we have only done sides in  college basketball  the p assit two years.  181-126 (58.9 percent ).  again get a clue.
RASPicks,that is  funny.  second of 23 plays that have gone against us this month (other was when two starters were scratched).
RASPicks,when the time comes we will switch to a private model and have better control of who gets access to picks.
RASPicks,the pick archive on o you are website automatically displays each pick 10 minutes a free throw er kick off.  .co/wlqmgw0ozb
RASPicks,ras handicapper craig was on eog radio show l assit night.  comes on about the 10 minute mark.  archive here:  .co/obsm55yf
RASPicks,actually  posted on my forum that he doesn't move lines as much as ras.  wish he archived his plays  tracked clv.
RASPicks,beating any kind of numbers is a good thing.  2k a pop is great for the v assit majority of bankrolls.
RASPicks,we haven't offered service since jan 15.  only way to get the picks is right here on twitter  the .co/jhawook2 forum.

VegasRefund,have always found it bizarre that the nfl never announces a date for when the upcoming seasons schedule will be released.
VegasRefund,i know there are better scorecenters out there.. but espn is by far the fastest.. and the need is for speed.

ProfessorShine,their information is full of nonsense trends and worthless public betting information.   there are better free o point ions out there
ProfessorShine,incredible that b dawk is hof and there was a period he was the 3rd best safety in the nfc east
ProfessorShine,that isnt a lie dummy. i simply said good luck as what else could  years old you are end game be?
ProfessorShine,its very very inportant to adhere to o you are values.   also were sorry for those values please dont be mad
ProfessorShine,there was a time nj didnt even give casino table players bottled beer.  n overtime surprised by them being cheap half-asses
ProfessorShine,brought up good points about vd but matty almost as bad with his defense of jason mcintyre being good at gambling.
suuma810,"huge bomb to fuller followed by a run for minus one yard which kills the drive.

you cant make this up."
suuma810,"thomas julio evans godwin?

if i built a roster id take those fo you are over him at the skill positions."
suuma810,if you arent into alternate totals probably about a handful with pending leans vs current pinny lines out of my head.
suuma810,to be fair they also have the best non-divisional record of all teams over the p assit ten years or something.
suuma810,few days ago i was wondering if theres a team that would trade for joe flacco. of course elway did. #broncos
suuma810,it helped them securing their lead they built via defense and few good passing drives but they didnt run to win.
suuma810,"agree. titans defense should give buf fits.
i just dont like the sp overtime for them laying 5 on the road."
suuma810,same as l assit season: offense was able to move the ball between the 20s but collapsed in the red zone.
suuma810,the #eagles need jason peters 100 percent  in week one. vaitai didn't show any progression he was awful during the preseason.
ClevTA,what are u asking? fade him? hes the worst bettor ive ever seen lol. im opp on clemson and lsu so
ClevTA,lakers are the best team in the west huh . beating up on all the patsies i guess gets u everywhere
ClevTA,th against the spread why i took it at 2 monday when the rumors started that he may n overtime play
ClevTA,love jimmy. really do. but hes horrendous at nfl betting and his game of the year is ravens -3.5. theres that
ClevTA,if theres one guy who can absolutely definitely play a full game off of a hamstring injury its definitely will fuller
ClevTA,his head was touched before he hit the ground and way before his hand went oob. glad it didnt cost me
ClevTA,right but just looking up and seeing it was always helpful. i know its 1st world problems but seems so simple
ClevTA,u can when u play penn st and michigan b2b weeks a free throw er racking up a bunch of sacks
ClevTA,hilarious. how the browns arent at le assit 4  point  favorites at this point is beyond me. allen has no chance
ClevTA,if u are sitting on +14 u have to hold  years old you are breath on that inevitable  fitzpatrick pick 6
ClevTA,but honestly u think an nfl team up 2 at half wants to quit? one of the oddest things ive heard
ClevTA,i see seattle -1 now for sunday a free throw er browns were -2 before l assit night. sounds about right
ClevTA,i love playoff baseball too. i was genuinely shocked when i turned on espn at 7 and they had a preview
ClevTA,$8 billion valuation for peloton. who knew an exercise bike could be so valuable.  deserves proceeds for all the free advertising
ClevTA,getting the jags in a tease that gets u over +7 is probably smart. hard to see a blowout either way
ClevTA,yeah. on bengals as well fyi. hit it at the open +1.5 but also on -1.5. doesnt bother me either way
ClevTA,im 100 percent  fully pr expected points added red for a baker to obj deep sh overtime on play 1 sunday
CizzlingSports,card counting is remarkably easy. n overtime getting flat-bet 86'd and trespassed from every place with a decent game is not.
CizzlingSports,"upd8d   college football  betting records.

hilarious.

note: these are only the plays clay sells on sun nights to his $99/year subs"
CizzlingSports,the decision made cents i think if u assume  is n overtime trying to go to a bowl game this year
CizzlingSports,20+ plays/day season and ok yeah we're really gonna understand why  and  would apparently rather drink bleach than provide bankroll recommendations

let me know when i should be expecting my check in the mail..."
spanky,better analogy - if a 600 pound guy walks into an all you can eat buffet would he be denied service?
spanky,ill be back again soon. hoping  or  could put me up so i can lose some more money in the sportsbook
spanky,yes i think so but 300 on those is fair especially since every shop hangs them and lines are pretty vanilla.
spanky,"youre right.  

i have automated programs that actually place tens of thousands of bets a day.  

good luck to you pal."
spanky,chris andrews is a gentleman bookmaker. he brings honor and prestige to the profession. pleasure being his customer and his friend.
spanky,no problem with raising. also no problem with circled. but the other 99.9 percent  of cases should have clearly stated limits
spanky,lmao. i took +180 fruitcake. youre fantasy hypothetical wet dream of watching me at a bar aint gonna happen. keep trollin.
spanky,are n overtime bookmakers.  they are dressmakers.  that being said despite them losing in nj i think they made money nationwide...
spanky,most of these c against the spread are degenerate gamblers.  implementing any kind of trading strategy is way over their heads.
spanky,it seems as if whoever is holding the ball with about a minute le free throw  will win it. crazy game
spanky,wise words.  i had the pleasure of having dinner with ca point ain jack. super sharp and a really nice guy.
spanky,you think they'll let me come and check it out? i  daily fantasy sports  wanna be escorted out in handcuffs by
DocBettor,"pels went up 27 and then really tried to give this away. ""clv doesn't matter"" crowd can take another l #gamblingtwitter"
DocBettor,thanks i tried to get more in-game at +500 but the bet g overtime rejected so it feels like a loss
PlusEVAnalytics,what youre missing mr lucky is that even recreational bettors have an expectation (or at le assit a hope) of winning.
PlusEVAnalytics,ok perfect as long as they disclose the theoretical house take so the purchaser knows exactly the cost of the entertainment.
PlusEVAnalytics,how about if they have a winning week youll delete  years old you are review of  book. otherwise leave me alone.
PlusEVAnalytics,"dear frankie

you claim to be  but  years old you are name means . 
what are you hiding?

friendly inquiries from"
PlusEVAnalytics,the rams moved to anaheim in 1980 so maybe its 38 non continuous years at the coliseum between 1946 and 2019?
PlusEVAnalytics,if youre a ref you need to carry that flag everywhere you go you never know when you will need it
PlusEVAnalytics,n overtime really. read taleb :) its n overtime about making good predictions its about understanding the limitations of imperfect ones.
PlusEVAnalytics,of course - otherwise how would the closing line value futures im going to sell you have a settlement value? :)
PlusEVAnalytics,fine. its the pl overtime of the episode that literally happened. now go crawl back under  years old you are rock.
PlusEVAnalytics,it will be a fair and honest conversation. im pretending to be a journalist and i take that pretend role seriously.
PlusEVAnalytics,if anything on this graphic causes confusion ignore the entire product is a hilarious disclaimer that i might have to steal.
PlusEVAnalytics,by definition one of milo or coco either is a square or is a sharp who g overtime this one wrong.
PlusEVAnalytics,much better answer courtesy  to the graveyard of failed angles we go. at le assit we had fun along the way.
PlusEVAnalytics,yes but n overtime in the same way as you do. im insulted that you havent listened to my  appearance :(
PlusEVAnalytics,tell god to give me my ho you are back and hes apologizing if he somehow offended me! textbook crystal meth...
PlusEVAnalytics,you need to be sherlock holmes to figure out whether this is good or bad for  years old you are side
PlusEVAnalytics,in most markets yes. in this one i dont believe it. even sharp bettors would have a hard time with this.
PlusEVAnalytics,agreed. we may have to put a bayesian model on the stamina parameter (rate of skill decay over time) as well.
PlusEVAnalytics,with a few exce point ions you generally dont want to make negative expected value bets for the purpose of hedging.
PlusEVAnalytics,do you really think that betting teams off an against the spread  loss in 2020-21 will yield a +2.7 percent  ev?
PlusEVAnalytics,its like rain on  years old you are wedding day (if you are getting married in the rainforest during rainy season)
aluckyaday,if the eu had worries that boris' proposal was just electioneering this will n overtime do much to change their mind!
aluckyaday,so free throw books are n overtime offering arb opportunities  . maybe whatever you use to detect arbs is too slow?
aluckyaday,every time a pundit says a horse is well handicapped are they saying the official handicapper is crap at their job?
aluckyaday,i think rebates is the name of the game when it comes to pari pros. n overtime a level playing field.
aluckyaday,i thought he was referring to how the posterior distribution had changed from the prior that was telling him to quit.
aluckyaday,what you need is a similar diagram for recreational punters. i'm guessing mathews point is he has seen such a thing?
aluckyaday,my take on technical analysis is it can be used to highlight the use of information that is n overtime public.
theFirmAISports,just signed up yesterday! definitely goes against  years old you are name... minus positive expected value play but its always fun!
joeytunes2,is this the worst  college football  season of all time. i feel like  it is  been all blow outs all year.

joeytunes2,haha ok ty though. took that the wrong way. he won the job by default. they tried giving it to tate
joeytunes2,any modelers out there. that would like to work out a deal. give me a dm. looking to expand some cappers.
joeytunes2,today is a notorious unders day. tired legs on 1 ho you are less sleep body clock. # feed me  #sportswisdom

joeytunes2,ty my guyyyy. appreciate the love. never ask for shit either.  i ask for the opportunity to earn for mi amigos!
joeyisaks,most locals are broke. won 59$ on a site l assit week and they said they needed a week to pay
joeyisaks,couch  with no chiefs or niners fans anywhere nearby  and no random people shouting every play for their bet. no thanks
joeyisaks,are you mebefore he sees name/ number on back of jersey ... shoulda been acuna since theyre just walkin leisurely around
joeyisaks,u will lose due to the vig on a strategy like this... like fading the public stuff just isnt valuable anymore
joeyisaks,everyone trying to bring down jambo missed out on tradewinds became action247 today / the old playbig site.. what a day!
joeyisaks,was a play on words cause ras been hitting these very early and ruining good numbers- think they g overtime 168.5
joeyisaks,maybe but theres a l overtime of value. have more on roma -125....the other ones i posted are all good tho
joeyisaks,these are off 68 percent  each screen shot. a bettor using these  percent  to live bet would go broke fairly quickly
EdMillerPoker,we'll have it next season. about six months ago we had to cut something from 2019 roadmap and we cut nba.
EdMillerPoker,"suspect having bad opinions loudly is actually the worlds oldest profession.

was probably considerably more dangerous in the p assit tho."
EdMillerPoker,been seeing people troll squabble and cut each other down for almost two decades now and this has always been true
EdMillerPoker,if i had a nickel for every time someone from europe has said the words in tennis for example to me...
EdMillerPoker,why n overtime ask for everyones second best if yall are putting up number two on  years old you are roster?
EdMillerPoker,i  daily fantasy sports  teach sports betting. i wrote a book but beyond that i'm working on a startup odds provider.
EdMillerPoker,whatever you are seeing there is certainly another explanation for it than serious bettors dont understand that public analytics have value
EdMillerPoker,i'm convinced some people maintain multiple twitter accounts solely for the purpose of creating long threads of bickering with one another
EdMillerPoker,(of course what they do then is revert to using results and therefore throw many babies out with the bath water.)
EdMillerPoker,this is a summary of part of the thought process that gets everyone thinking they need to be everyones first sportsbook.
EdMillerPoker,you can either bluff once on the flop or check-fold depending on how many preflop calls and how table plays postflop
EdMillerPoker,if you make it play the nfl on fox theme song every time you open the app its a lock imo
EdMillerPoker,its amazing how o free throw en whenever someone brings up a problem with sports betting the example comes from tennis
EdMillerPoker,my sons a figure skater. this is the first time to my knowledge weve had a major competition in las vegas.
EdMillerPoker,also integrity monitoring (dislike that word bc of how its turned into a political football) so free throw ware development etc
EdMillerPoker,most ppl buying/investing in sports ip/models/big data whatever are going to be v disappointed. esp if the ip is already built.
EdMillerPoker,his schtick is to be loud and dumb about everything right? shame that seems to be such a profitable media niche.
EdMillerPoker,i dont know how to fix it but the financial incentives for media companies are so damn broken at the moment.
GolcondaFund,horse whisper prefers n overtime to use the st against the spread that do n overtime align with his homer fandom.
GolcondaFund,"you obviously did n overtime watch the game play for play.

i've already wasted too much handicapping time indulging these fantasies."
GolcondaFund,to be honest with how seattle d looks...i think bengals can win this su. if dalton does n overtime have turnovers.
nonrandomalpha,i remember back in the day (week4) when every homer was picking the bears to blow out their opponent. good times.
LeeSharpeNFL,"same row so phi dal nyg was.

plus same color so hou ten ind jax.

plus same column so kc ne."
LeeSharpeNFL,i would be surprised if the top 50 aren't all quarterbacks.  it is  the most valuable position by a huge margin.
LeeSharpeNFL,incase you missed it  i did a thread on an image telling the story of each divisional race through week 16!
LeeSharpeNFL,wow  is gonna n overtime punish rodgers for that fumble in dakota can't believe he's so biased in favor of rodgers.
LeeSharpeNFL,which has higher expected points there: kicking a field goal or an end zone fade? i genuinely do n overtime know.
LeeSharpeNFL,"i'm counting on you n overtime to let the ""is trubisky real?"" hype train gain momentum 

(media momentum which does exist.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,"enjoy the fun season! you never know the future.

signed
a bears fan with fond memories of the 2018 regular season"
LeeSharpeNFL,"i clicked this and discovered there's a ""running backs  daily fantasy sports  matter"" ugly sweater..... and i kinda want it now......"
LeeSharpeNFL,other people using ron's stuff that he provides openly and for free does n overtime create an obligation of his time.
LeeSharpeNFL,really impressed with everyone crushing the big data bowl. predicting the running game is a hard problem. there's so much variance!
LeeSharpeNFL,correct filter out scrambles. i also filter out throwaways (those should already have a cp of na if using my function).
LeeSharpeNFL,expected points added  is a bogus stat because  it is  for teams.  that is  why i stick with  touchdown :int ratio.
LeeSharpeNFL,a free throw er careful consideration i've decided n overtime to bet on the +50000 that it will be jerry jones.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""what is the team with those gray jersies? it looks like someone forg overtime to finish rendering them.""

- my partner"
LeeSharpeNFL,that would move the line in the direction of the packers. but  it is  moving in the direction of the niners.
LeeSharpeNFL,really enjoy theorycra free throw ing and talking through problems and exchanging code with you you're great to work with. :)
LeeSharpeNFL,really awesome of you to spend time before  years old you are job helping set up others for success. that rules.
LeeSharpeNFL,ah yep. their 2nd vs. o you are 3rd that we made them swap are gonna be like 15 picks apart.
whale_capper,through the f15 games luka is the clear mvp and hes 20... only giannis has higher trade value at this moment
whale_capper,a first drive turnover would you look at that... deep dive listeners sign up for o you are free primetime contest:
whale_capper,those are some of the absolute best in class but i think its a bet against the favs kind of day
whale_capper,new deep dive is live... we put a bow on week 4 and lookahead at the openers for week 5 enjoy!
whale_capper,week 3 nfl  preview was a banger... entertaining and informative as you prep  years old you are card for this week:
whale_capper,i dont 100 percent  remember but didnt he only have like 2 or 3 pass attem points  the whole first half?
whale_capper,strong agree at le assit theyre built on youth (n overtime that i especially liked their dra free throw  picks )
whale_capper,neither have i but i suspect b365 might (if you have a way in) sportsbook d overtime ag worth checking too
whale_capper,sad that the listeners missed o you are breakdown of human extinction level event probabilities in the prep convo we had
whale_capper,re-posting o you are deep dive into closing line value (clv)...  told me this topic is h overtime in the streets:
whale_capper,good call best n overtime to get mad online on a holiday weekend... ill save my thoughts for this clowns obituary
whale_capper,yeah aside from their h overtime start to the season the nuggets have been very average... below avg on the road
AndyMSFW,hey  i know you've been off social media for a h overtime minute but... did you hear about the assit ros?
AndyMSFW,this sounds so fucking right that i'm n overtime even going to look it up.  i'll probably make that bet now.
AndyMSFW,give me lsu/tosu at over under 79.5 and watch me bet the alternate overs all the way up to a hondo
AndyMSFW,like trying to buy a 2019 ford fiesta with a plinko chip because i saw it on the price is right.
AndyMSFW,i mean you may want to just try  years old you are luck with the logs  pigs.  might be less frustrating.
AndyMSFW,oh man if people only knew how many degen live bets i put down on daytime soccer when i get bored...
AndyMSFW,"years from now scholars will use this single tweet as the preeminent example of what it meant to ""get fucking ratio'd"""
AndyMSFW,thanks  it is  partially just a way for me to reference back to the market's preseason sentiments later in the year.
AndyMSFW,g overtime to take it easy on lonnie i still think that was caused by the greg gagne sleight of hand
AndyMSFW,begs the question: what is the criteria for the world rankings of accounting firms and who is putting together said rankings?
AndyMSFW,"good news bad news day.
 italy o2.5 lost
 sam kerr top goalscorer is back from the dead now tied for 1st"
AndyMSFW,i was just saying to someone that there is a halfway feasible scenerio where argentina could advance without scoring at all.
AndyMSFW,felix for sure has better groundies and movement if he continues to handle the returns it should be a good 'un.
AndyMSFW,kids are in bed whiskey is poured wife's needs are satisfied (for now) just about done with these trash leagues' previews

TheKostos,i stan for kim jones a free throw er she called out any reporter caping up for that clown gettleman. bravo
TheKostos,the redskins are playing with literally all backups in the secondary and dak is 6/7 for 6 yards.  what the fuck
TheKostos,i had a good amount on them week 1 and on the 49ers when they killed them on  sunday night football
TheKostos,all the jameis winston worship going to come to an end real quick if he gets benched and ruins fantasy seasons

TheKostos,ive won way too many bets this week to feel comfortable. disaster is looming. gamblor i humbly ask thee for mercy
TheKostos,for practice is one of the dumbest coaching comments ever. saban is a true  but that is just stupid behind words
TheKostos,hilarious that he makes that one and misses the 40 yarder l assit week that costs me 30k. piece of shit
TheKostos,falcons more sacks in the first 2.5 quarters of this game than they had in the l assit 5 games combined
TheKostos,was actually thinking it'd benefit psg lol because the fans won't be there to audibly gasp as they choke it away
TheKostos,#nbanick with a horrendous pick in the spurs and a winner with the pelicans. suns +3.5 pending for another 2-1 night.
TheKostos,and yes i have probably seen every charlie sheen episode (the ashton kutcher episodes never happened as far as i'm concerned)
TheKostos,only outcome that screws me now is napoli 2:1 barca. everything else and  it is  a great a free throw eernoon
TheKostos,the  crew is on a prettay prettay good run at the moment. follow the show account for tons of gambling content.
TheKostos,you could have given me 10 guesses as to what state incarnate word is in and i wouldn't have guessed texas
TheKostos,nothing like rolling out of bed to watch  years old you are tennis bet win in a fourth set tiebreak #thiemtime
TheKostos,"holy shit what an end to that eli press conference. ""only a giant."" legend. my all-time favorite athlete. next stop canton."
TheKostos,can't wait for when  years old you are idol phil rivers retires and you fangirl out for his (surely failed) candidacy
TheKostos,made the mistake of letting eli meet my girl. is he the new #mrstealyourgirl? might n overtime end well for me.
TheKostos,didnt want jason garrett as head coach. fine with him as oc. apparently this is very difficult for people to comprehend
TheKostos,im from ny and you have a white sox logo as  years old you are avatar. we can agree to disagree
TheKostos,chiefs fans should be thrilled if eric bienemy doesn't get a job. badass oc. his time is coming as a hc.
LockyLockerson,i like all kinds of stuff.  tend to n overtime exclude very much just depends on mood.  thanks for the recommendations!
LockyLockerson,"didn't say taggart said ""coaching"" or i guess ""people in charge of program"" would be a better way of putting it."
LockyLockerson,i have a project in the works for the tournament that i think everyone will get a l overtime out of.
LockyLockerson,also while i'm on here chattering wanted to mention liberty opened -21 at umass next week and i can't stop laughing
LockyLockerson,difficult for a team to do as many dumb things in a short amount of time as the lions just did
LockyLockerson,hi! no sorry just via ebook for this first installment.  wanted to gauge interest with low overhead before deciding next step.
LockyLockerson,an offshore has put up about 25 more heavily juiced  college football  win totals today/tonight and some of them are...hoooo boy.
LockyLockerson,if my son wakes up in the next 30  minutes too bad.  welcome to the playoffs kid.  4th quarter winning time.
LockyLockerson,with it pouring track sealed i'm gonna go improbable but sprinkle in some war of will spinoff and by my standards
LockyLockerson,so if mlb expanded the playoffs but reduced the number of games/series that would be something you could go along with?
LockyLockerson,i would say something about professionalism but they beat everyone by 50 and id get bored too if  it was me
LockyLockerson,just seemed a little rogue and this was a possible permutation  to be fair i was misreading the bracket though lol

TheCousinSal,outrageous.  and i discussed sunday night. and one of the 10 is a london game.  play that shit in the am!!
TheCousinSal,this is going to do wonders for my popularity in pennsylvania or new jersey.  i may have to run for governor.
TheCousinSal,good point  my legs are the most honest part of my body. probably because i refuse to scrub them while showering.

TheCousinSal,wow - ohio st. comes out flat again. mark my words this will all turn around once urban meyer gets reinstated.

TheCousinSal,yeah - they dont teach how to react to season-ending trades 8 days before kickoff in grudens qb camp do they?
TheCousinSal,celts are 9-0 against the spread  at home in the 2018 playoffs. th against the spread like really hard to do.

TheCousinSal,the miami marlins record since derek jeters group purchased the team is 120-203. hall of fame? sorry. i dont see it.
12Xpert,love it when people create new things from data ive collected. this was the whole point when i started in 2001.
12Xpert,ranked like this liverpool are away and clear manchester city are third bottom and arsenal are basically just crap all round.
12Xpert,"""efficiency"" is like will-o'-the-wisp: we think we know what it is but it always seems to elude o you are grasp."
12Xpert,exactly how it works in europe. sometimes they  daily fantasy sports  even let you buy the milk you came in for.
12Xpert,you know very well what i mean by this. skilled poker players can be down a free throw er 100000 plays.
12Xpert,and so athletics is reduced to this a sea of detritus... a place where people have stopped believing what they see.
12Xpert,he does it n overtime to get under the umpires skin but his opponents. frankly i think it verges on cheating.
12Xpert,full credit goes to  for proposing the idea to utilise maximum likelihood estimation to find the o point imal betting model.
12Xpert,as i said  it is  a factor but it doesn't explain why recreational books remain inefficient at closing relative to pinny.
12Xpert,but you have to explain why a recreational book's closing odds are so much less efficient relative to pinny's closing odds.
12Xpert,if you could give me a more detailed example of what you are suggesting then perhaps i can understand it better.

mohegan sun 
mount airy
wind creek
lady luck
meadows"
capjack2000,i like it. who will take the first snap for the colts in week 1? seems like a good #nameabet
capjack2000,because they haven't expanded yet or because this seems to let kambi into the vegas market (via m and trop)?
capjack2000,"and then what about indiana? where it seems penn has sold the ""2nd skin"" to both thescore and pointsbet concurrently."
capjack2000,"the first question i ask other mlb bettors when i meet them: ""do you win in july?"" 

 explores the phenomenon..."
capjack2000,good article shedding light on what goes on behind the scenes with in-game betting. looking forward to parts 2  3.
capjack2000,"action network bleacher report barstool sports are all doa in any state that copies njs regulations.

dinkinc,tappanzee....  it is  a longtime bridge north of nyc which just changed  it is  name which was news to me
dinkinc,""" you stink so bad we will punt on 4th and 2 from  years old you are thirty...poor little jetsies"""
dinkinc,it took trump to make us realize that.  it might be even higher.  check back in a year or so
dinkinc,great stuff.  i think  years old you are numbers will get better as the season progresses and more info presents
dinkinc,you're an architect and you lack an attention span...  that is  unusual ...  it is  an mma weekend for me...
dinkinc,th against the spread nice of them.  i still say its an error by the writer. customers are gonna freak.
dinkinc,lee over atlas .. some brilliant stuff.  crowd shocked and disappointed but likely jake is going to a better place
dinkinc,o free throw en....   try always..... and the entire game would do better if that was n overtime the case
dinkinc,they kicked a  field goal  from the one down by 20.  they are likely to quick kick on third down
dinkinc,wh against the spread a fo you are letter word ending in unt that is used to describe a woman??
dinkinc,there are more than 156 combinations to bet each horserace...  exactas trifectas and superfectas and you can use multi combinations
dinkinc,had another strong choice but he is more behind the scenes although he just wrote a book for advanced beginners
dinkinc,probably thought if the stewards didnt call it the objection has zero chance so why look like a bad guy
dinkinc,that was fascinating and extremely sad to learn..... i am sure it is accurate as it was so well presented...
robpizzola,ravens are pretty much at the top of their range right now. almost impossible to bet them at these numbers.
robpizzola,now what happens if you go back a decade and remove games that are lined at a touchdown or less?
robpizzola,everett running open down the sidelines with no one within ten yards and goff missed him by a nautical mile.
robpizzola,can we get a single replay of that missed high sticking call or do we just pretend it never happened?
robpizzola,you watching this game? im n overtime a big fan of watson but hes light years ahead of this bum.
robpizzola,colorado has to have the worst goal scoring song and i  daily fantasy sports  even think  it is  remotely close.
robpizzola,"you wouldn't believe how much ""he did exactly what he was supposed to do"" i g overtime l assit night."
robpizzola,blues/jets may be lacking goals but  it is  certainly n overtime lacking excitement. end to end action. this is great.
robpizzola,it really is especially when considering how teams that are down 0-3 in a series consistently underperform vs. market expectations.
robpizzola,minnesota wild +157 tonight if you're interested in getting some good value and then losing in overtime or a shootout.
RASPicks,you won't have many people le free throw  to chart if waiting for pinn to raise  college football  total limits.
RASPicks,53 plays le free throw  in phase 2 unsure if there will be a phase 3 and yes we are.
RASPicks,we'd have to be really stupid to do something like that.  my guess is someone using some sort of automation.
RASPicks,to repeat: please retract  years old you are statement that we took a lucrative private deal. it was factually inaccurate.
RASPicks,30+  minutes a free throw er cris goes full 5k limits  groups start firing isn't when market is most volatile.
RASPicks,have team working on this daily from every possible angle.  it has been more challenging than imagined.  hopefully resolved soon.
RASPicks,i  daily fantasy sports  advise teasing either.  just pass if you missed the numbers and be ready for next time.
RASPicks,no one should be limited to one style or method additional time and focus would provide opportunity to master others.
RASPicks,wnba:  we released over 162.5 in tulsa/minnesota yesterday.  the two teams play again tomorrow and the current number is 172.
RASPicks,mobile betting app from leroy's looks great.  has anyone tried it yet?  hopefully more vegas books follow their lead.  .co/ipxy6o3c
RASPicks,market disagreement enables us to release another free play this week.  released this at -5.5 yesterday:  332 miami ohio -4
RASPicks,difficult question to answer.  there is no guarantee the market would be significantly better if we had never released totals.

ProfessorShine,win\loss isnt as important as process. good handicappers lost yesterday baylor +7.  that is a great bet regardless of result.
ProfessorShine,instead of using elli overtime and all 4 downs u play for a  field goal  and still need a  touchdown
ProfessorShine,any insightful commentary will be drowned out by the likes of klay and this sal character.   hey its all entertainment!
ProfessorShine,amazing peter burns! they just seem to know exactly how these games will fall!  which is so great for them!
ProfessorShine,that was easy vote for thread of the year.   did they find him?  or is it gonna be on netflix?
ProfessorShine,no there isnt a gray area to everything.  you also have a bias as you sell cheap packaged picks also

suuma810,the raiders have an abysmal pass defense but bill obrien called 8 runs on the l assit 12 first downs.
suuma810,the total win number exceeded 261. just seems like some folks defined it as a peak and grabbed some unders.
suuma810,instant  great analysis by  on new cleveland brown greedy williams. love the format. ward  williams could be an intriguing duo.
suuma810,the jets can get the first overall pick this week and its possible if the seahawks rest their starters. via
suuma810,no touchdown because you run it up the middle for -1 yard on first down. it didnt work all game
suuma810,yeah but schottenheimer runs a scheme that needs a good ol and has little to do with football in 2018.
suuma810,nathaniel bringing it. a good defense and making things as easy as possible for bortles will likely be enough again.
ClevTA,uk should run philly special. would work for a  touchdown  here. but im on vt so run it instead plz
ClevTA,as long as mcdaniels doesnt touch personnel decisions i think hes fine. could be very cleveland centric fo and staff
ClevTA,l assit year baker completes that to perriman and somehow this year he underthrows obj. unreal how off he is
ClevTA,only way u play boone over freeman is if both mattison and cook are announced out for sure otherwise freeman
ClevTA,wow  brissett missed doyle down the seam for a  touchdown . but of course n overtime a word from booger
ClevTA,must be nice having to face a backup qb who cant complete a pass. th against the spread the travesty
ClevTA,explain 1 off  touchdown  against northwestern. also explain how osu didnt look ahead l assit night in the same scenario
ClevTA,why are u snapping the punt with 10 seconds on the play clock??? insanity how dumb this team can be
ClevTA,yes kiid if they end up 14-2 that will be good. i like to live in a real world lol
ClevTA,if atl is going to play that prevent to the sticks i can see philly throw it high to jj
ClevTA,that bills d is nasty. id like a live sh overtime of u watching eli avoiding a pick 6 late
ClevTA,totally agree the playcall was an issue. i think th against the spread a s expected points added rate point.
ClevTA,this clemson ending is an all timer. based on announcers and the crowd youd think this was for the gm
ClevTA,lol stay dumb? they are getting a bunch of high picks back. they stink anyways why wouldnt u completely tank??
CizzlingSports,"yeah really  daily fantasy sports  think racial stuff qualifies as general ""satire making fun of man rules"" my goodness 

cc:"
CizzlingSports,did u consult with  before or a free throw er deciding that touting a 350 play sample size made sense?
CizzlingSports,lmao reasonably certain u shouldnt be thanking anyone at  for introducing u to gambling but  i do n overtime know
CizzlingSports,hi  i guess this zombie fight is over already funny though it hasnt even started yet on the espn+ stream
CizzlingSports,very special series of #tbt this weak fam.  it is  the 1 year anniversary of the  special!!! (1/3 cont'd wed.-thurs.):
CizzlingSports,he says bet vt vs. duke at any number which obv only increases odds of k v. roy part iv
CizzlingSports,says he can solve the coronavirus outbreak yes this is the same man whose solution to nfl player protests was...
CizzlingSports,weird take from a guy who to 11 because a commercial airline wouldn't let his kid fly with head lice
CizzlingSports,it is  because they are giving themselves free +units on plays that resolved before they started selling picks on 8/27/19
CizzlingSports,well tbf promoting fraud touts is moar fun and a l overtime easier than actually thinking so cant argue there
spanky,youre a good man nelson but i answered enough of  years old you are questions l assit podc assit .
spanky,of course but what good is o point imal closing line value if you dont get paid when you win!
spanky,they all know i get the best numbers. i have too many outs and my technology is second to none.
spanky,of course the better question then becomes how many subscribers have that kinda money set aside as a gambling bankroll?
spanky,despite steve stevens  being very entertaining hes ruining lives.  how many examples does one need to stay away from touts?
spanky,do reasons have to be given to buy or sell a stock?  th against the spread a zero sum game
spanky,the list of bookmakers you have worked for and/or learned from is probably the most comprehensive list ive ever seen.
spanky,good to hear.  i have no experience in public speaking. im glad i was able to pass on some knowledge
spanky,i think its an a moneyline policy. if you need help with a few pieces to meet the requirement lmk
spanky,the point is the cs d expected points added rtment is n overtime in an office its in a house!
spanky,offshores treat customers better than this.  side note -  its counterintuitive to hang on under on top of an over...
spanky,as long as it isint a college saturday or nfl sunday you and  are always welcome. great meeting you guys.
spanky,can't argue with you there... you should see the guys in my office.  they come into work in pajamas sometimes....
spanky,exactly louie.  its even better if you could lay -105 at one or both of  years old you are outs
spanky,matchbook acce point ed us postup 15 years ago.   college basketball  market was acce point able but far from liquid
spanky,you just g overtime me thinking. i miss fernando.  what a great bookmaker he was and an even better man.
spanky,i respectfully disagree. middling is just another tool in the professionals arsenal.  creating line value and manipulation inherently involves middling.
DocBettor,"i'm in america too. i was just addressing  years old you are question ""how can you say money is safe?"""
DocBettor,actually im wrong  because a team with 156 could score a 3 which would make the maximum possible total 315
DocBettor,i was actually trying to middle with under 199.5 at another out but le free throw  holding the bag whoops
DocBettor,only took a minute of my time to do it so i figured $3600/ho you are was a good rate
DocBettor,my personal favorite recent instance of this: knicks had 14 percent  chance of winning the nba dra free throw  lottery
DocBettor,awesome and thanks for sharing  im going to go ahead and take credit for getting you involved in this conversation
PlusEVAnalytics,0-5 on  thursday night football  and i made my dentist appointment for the day a free throw er halloween ama
PlusEVAnalytics,the argument for yes would be any given sunday anything could happen l assit week was more noise than signal
PlusEVAnalytics,to anyone predicting 2019 aaa home run totals who doesnt understand parameter uncertainty this would be a 35 sigma event.
PlusEVAnalytics,did everyone just really whiff on their assessment of this london stadium or is the market overreacting to one game?
PlusEVAnalytics,initial stake? when  years old you are social media interns dont even understand how  years old you are product works...
PlusEVAnalytics,heres a fun one to think about - what if 2010s capitalism earns the same retroactive outrage is 1930s racism?
PlusEVAnalytics,the sports analytics version of this would be a hybrid player level + team level model fit in one step.
PlusEVAnalytics,the controversy is the guy and his wife shared their selections with each other and used that to their advantage.
aluckyaday,mines an old version in portuguese so yours might be slightly different. file menu - o point ions - formulas
aluckyaday,actually g overtime bills pk (10/11) broncos +6 (10/11) chiefs +5 (20/23)  but will use the computers numbers when grading.
aluckyaday,the issue with taking tickets as written is an employee with a grudge could in theory bankru point  a casino....
aluckyaday,that is n overtime a good look. would be interesting to see the distribution of starting points for those opinions.
aluckyaday,they get pretty protective when it comes to spam. if their ip addresses get on blacklists it causes them problems.
aluckyaday,where did you scrape it from? do they have previous years? p daily fantasy sports  are a pain to parse!
aluckyaday,who do you think out of the top 10 gc guys is the most likely to have a bad day?
joeytunes2,agree. at most there's only 2 sports in the us as far as markets with real liquidity. football and nba.
joeytunes2,455 sf +6. kittles is back and a huge part of that offense. fade the almighty ravens. # feed me
joeytunes2,anyone else excited for ohio st rutgers.  will there be full limits? or treat it like a harlem globetrotters game?
joeytunes2,what sports g overtime worse over the l assit 20 years?  whether it be rule change or just the play?
joeytunes2,who said year a free throw er year. and i didnt say i was down. just al overtime i see.
joeytunes2,fave game vt or  would say vmi #oldschool vt-2.5/3  it is  gone now but  maybe the scalpers take some 4
joeytunes2,to get tossed? u havent been up my ass? you ok? or that i dominate football like no other human.
joeytunes2,if you bet baltimore good news! chris davis is out. so you get a 210 hitter over a 0.011 hitter
joeytunes2,"under texas (l)

joeytunes2,going in on bears 2hlf -3 plus 10 ...small play. n overtime a big 2hf guy. but this makes sense
joeytunes2,still cant believe winter is over. i'm expecting a huge storm. i dont think  it is  going to happen though.
joeytunes2,heres the whole gang of guys now.  yup we do mlb.  i'll tweet out a play tommorow before we go.

joeyisaks,ya it was supposed to be a dm deleted it before game but was on that and some other props
joeyisaks,hahahha whoops.. ohio state 1h over 34.5 and 35 never had a sh overtime even at 28-0 in first q
joeyisaks,inside info to me was harder to breathe 8-1 will be first song marooon5 plays. lets see if it happens?
joeyisaks,will betonline keep allowing me to beat their openers or so they eventually give the boot? just started playin there
EdMillerPoker,im n overtime writing regulations here im making a point about culture and really marketing and branding more than anything
EdMillerPoker,there's no palpable error rule in nevada. please  daily fantasy sports  pretend  it is  a necessary rule in any way.
EdMillerPoker,better yes but really more different than better. everyone tries to differentiate in this industry in roughly the same way.
EdMillerPoker,if you want a sense for the quality of the data feeds watch a gamec assit and look for errors
EdMillerPoker,people like being bullshitted man. it gives them a high same as smoking drinking eating f assit food gambling etc.
EdMillerPoker,i think its probably nearly impossible for a regular voter to try to predict who will be a good president
EdMillerPoker,dont follow politics much but every time this guy hit my radar it just smelled like naked corru point ion
EdMillerPoker,they have a csv of all the bets if i have a few minutes in the morning ill run it.

nonrandomalpha,find some racist angle and exploit it for likes and attention. you know  years old you are standard go-to content...
nonrandomalpha,yeah seen bizarrely aggressive playcalling from p against the spread v all the scrubs. brady passing 40-50x v these teams.
nonrandomalpha,and somehow the saints had the ball for almost a whole quarter longer than the cowboys...36  minutes to 23 min.
nonrandomalpha,kcs defense is incredibly volatile. they either get immediate pressure and get sack or force int or get effortlessly shredded.
LeeSharpeNFL,it was close but i think it is more likely it was a forward pass than it was a fumble.
LeeSharpeNFL,"cardinals just went for it on 4th and 2.

pete carroll threw the challenge flag arguing they had to punt."
LeeSharpeNFL,jags should miss the extra point on purpose so the raiders play conservatively and try for the  field goal .
LeeSharpeNFL,where would we get war from? (i know pff is working on one but it is n overtime public certainly.)
LeeSharpeNFL,good for the jags running a fake punt. down 4 scores you have to try high variance stuff and hope.
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  n overtime bad. i assume you did 2009-2019? what was  years old you are minimum attem points /year?
LeeSharpeNFL,"(this was a joke about how ohio state are the ""buckeyes"" and saying ""bucks"" sounds like the milwaukee nba team.)"
LeeSharpeNFL,so tonight are we rooting for the texans to hopefully give o you are ravens homefield advantage in the playoffs?
LeeSharpeNFL,why is the bears/lions thanksgiving game a pick em? better qb at home n overtime being a favorite is surprising.

RufusPeabody,seth youre an extremely sharp guy. n overtime questioning that. but i still dont understand how that conclusion follows.

SportsCheetah,that was one of the best snaps i've ever seen. (also n overtime luckbox you seahawks fans can stop).
SportsCheetah,that may be extreme but it was -204 on the first whack and i thought that was pretty short.
SportsCheetah,can we pay somebody to go through and see what his 3 point  percent  is on these attem points
SportsCheetah,at this point for rivalry week id rather see ohio state -69.5 vs. akron than just stomping harbaugh again.
SportsCheetah,the single bonus no foul at the rate most kids make  free throw s these days is beyond me.
SportsCheetah,when sports betting is legalized across the country this will be the future of pickup games at gyms everywhere.
SportsCheetah,yeah theyve been atrocious. hornets hadnt covered a 2h yet this season and just put it to sac town.
SportsCheetah,see other guy jumps offside for the game on 4th and 1 from 6 inches away from the ball

ProfessorShine,he may have been misquoted early in his run but his bet the process interview was sort of sketchy.
ProfessorShine,nielsen does n overtime guarantee any results or performance or endorse rank approve or recommend any products or services
ProfessorShine,id like to know the real story from a reputable news source.  or at le assit a news source
ProfessorShine,why refs dont give a warning to calipari about being outside the box and whining every call baffles me.
ProfessorShine,the beef isnt always with the fraudulent people; its with the clueless sports media who provide them a forum.
ProfessorShine,small sample trends quantifying focus gut feelings fades cliches ignoring prices....just every awful poor betting strategy you can name.
ProfessorShine,this trend is completely random. and worthless.  the 90 blazers have nothing in common with 19 blazers.  good grief.
suuma810,why do they call 25 runs at all. could jump higher leads when leaning to their efficient passing attack.
suuma810,get on board for the rest of the season. save 20 percent  with the code joshallen20! sign up here:
suuma810,"the baltimore #ravens are incredibly underrated and here's why:

team preview schedule analysis  a pick on the win total."
suuma810,thanks. i was just getting the linear line with geom_smooth(). need to dig more into the layer-customizing next time.
suuma810,interesting read by  on josh rosen.  his takes make me believe even more that miami g overtime a steal.
suuma810,the titans will be without dt jurrell casey but the colts will be without c ryan kelly. two blows.

ClevTA,havent watched a minute of this first half. someone tell me how seattle lucks their way into this win
ClevTA,if u think ravens lose or its a really close game tonight id hit sf now. otherwise id wait
ClevTA,6 straight games with ypc of 2.7 or less. he has to be the worst rb ive ever seen
ClevTA,yes im aware he isnt playing. neither is boogie or kuzma and the rest of the roster is dirt
ClevTA,u are 38.5  point  underdogs and u kick a  field goal  from the 2 to go up 5-0. congrat
ClevTA,yes but combined with the win rate by the individual ol it shows that protection wasnt the main issue.

spanky,contests meaning capping contests or games? i rarely if ever enter contests. games i bet a l overtime of.
spanky,given  years old you are analysis what is the chance that this is bad luck vs. lack of talent?
spanky,100 percent  . anthony has probably booked a few sharps that didnt bet much but continuously won.  all good
spanky,i follow the yankees a bit but would bet against them in a heartbeat if the price were right...
spanky,its ironic how their common practice of lowering limits has come back around to bite them in the ass

spanky,the sometimes is used for you to figure out when those sometimes apply....  do you expect silver platter treatment?
spanky,hes a professional.... just like all bad be against the spread you shake the sting off and push forward.
spanky,coincidentally the bookmakers that always beat me were very successful at betting.... a betting bookmaker is a lethal combination!
spanky,one of my favorite places to stop when im in vegas. howard schwartz had every gambling book imaginable... #neverstoplearning
spanky,it seems like a lifetime ago when nba totals over 200 were a rarity.  the power of the 3-pointer

PlusEVAnalytics,this is one where the mean (what you posted) and the median (what really matters) could be quite different
PlusEVAnalytics,unless there are like 100 different pro systems and they cherry picked 3? th against the spread quite possible.
PlusEVAnalytics,my transaction finally cleared. took 5 hours. i could have flown to costa rica with a bag of cash.
PlusEVAnalytics,kelly didnt choose it as much as he discovered it (really bernoulli discovered it but whatever). its mathematical fact.
PlusEVAnalytics,wasnt there some graph that showed seth was like 2 sigmas less of an asshole than the cville mean?
PlusEVAnalytics,something like that. in reality i had partners where i did the analytics and getting down was their job.

aluckyaday,is it really on eurosport or just the player? uk schedule says tennis on 1 and superbikes on 2
aluckyaday,i have a theory that is a bit of a misconce point ion of how certain books currently operate.

ProfessorShine,which book in lv sets openers before cris?  theyre a small part of the global sports betting market
ProfessorShine,nice of showtime to hook up vegas dave with free advertising.  tons of new bettors to sign up.
ProfessorShine,unless a place like michael gaughn get a nj license this is wh against the spread gonna happen
ProfessorShine,my god this gold sheet bruce marshall guy is godawful.  sounds like every bad bettor ive ever met.
ProfessorShine,if oscars had any true sense of humor theyd bring out rob lowe  snow white to sing something.

ClevTA,talk about a chance to get everyone nationally off  years old you are back. baker can do it
ClevTA,dont worry chris im just going to take credit for  years old you are win l assit week

spanky,thanks pal.  ive made up for lost times during the early years. these trolls just love to hate.
spanky,ehh... id take my chances booking anyone on a closing nfl line. but im n overtime a bookmaker...
spanky,i get asked daily for sports picks. let me flip the scri point .  who's winning the derby?
spanky,i call bullshit. were u betting some props and they banned you or put u at 1/100th limits?
spanky,if theres edge on the new number then by all means bang em.  over moves should be punished...
spanky,fair enough i didnt crunch the numbers factoring in resizing. that being said i never bet full kelly
spanky,i was on hold with them for hours and i couldn't get this song out of my head
spanky,i'll be there around the 10th of november.. i'll be at the  ... stop by and say hi
spanky,all good bro. i highly respect and admire  years old you are blackjack work. thanks for being cool.

DocBettor,they're also asking how to count cards at blackjack in the virtual casino which is n overtime possible
PlusEVAnalytics,propswap blew all their marketing dollars on rufus then vegas dave and faketits bonyfingers get engaged. tough luck!
PlusEVAnalytics,also the contest entry process was pretty rigid about naming an official proxy which we obv didnt do.
PlusEVAnalytics,like the supercontest but the winner is whoever goes 3-2 the most weeks. sign me up for that.
PlusEVAnalytics,math twitter (so basically  is there a closed form solution for x? or at le assit an approximation?
PlusEVAnalytics,why do people keep calling my shit underrated within 3 minutes of posting it give it a chance!
PlusEVAnalytics,ambiguity + lack of transparency opens the door for all kinds of bad actors to do bad things.
PlusEVAnalytics,yeah that section is more geared for newbies -  minutes pass line + max odds is the lesson
PlusEVAnalytics,im guessing youre n overtime an actuarial student...so it depends on how well you could pass as one.
PlusEVAnalytics,this field will be in better shape next year a free throw er all the groundskeepers get deported
PlusEVAnalytics,q for anyone whos read dante...who gets the lower circle of hell smooth talking liars or attention whores?
PlusEVAnalytics,bell doesnt have an army of data scientists on the payroll (who are real because rufus met them)
PlusEVAnalytics,what the fuck  is a special presidential envoy for hostage affairs? how is that a full time job?
PlusEVAnalytics,i hope s2 of action has a segment showing the touts going to town on that block button
PlusEVAnalytics,if anyone has a historical database of in-play odds for mens tennis please slide into the dms thanks
PlusEVAnalytics,youre n overtime wrong. paying out 1000 to 1 odds on a $2 bet shouldnt break the bank.

PlusEVAnalytics,ive never met you and youre pretending to be someone else who ive also never met. cheers though.
aluckyaday,in game is actually another big issue with exchanges. the ones with the fastest feeds/courtsiders will always win.

aluckyaday,as well as this article there are links in it to  investigations in to efficiency of other markets
aluckyaday,just because i have no idea what they are does n overtime mean they  daily fantasy sports  exist
aluckyaday,"""transition period with goods moving as now until a free trade deal is done"" isn't that the backstop?"
aluckyaday,how do you determine the distribution of  years old you are edge and know it has no bias?
aluckyaday,the solution is to remove all humans from the earth. maybe we will manage to do that first!
aluckyaday,why would you want to help recreational bettors? it is them that pays  years old you are bills
aluckyaday,shame conservative mps will be as blind to this as they are over the public's view of brexit!

EdMillerPoker,as usual this argument is won before it starts by defining sharp book into an absurd little corner
EdMillerPoker,and  daily fantasy sports  forget to watch today's games with a browser tab open to  all day long.
EdMillerPoker,correct we definitely do n overtime just set play and let it run. thanks alun another great question.
EdMillerPoker,thanks man. you gotta stop by one day and meet the team we hired you would love them.

EdMillerPoker,sorry when i said no one cares i actually meant i doubt it hits the national news cycle
EdMillerPoker,i'll have to listen... seems like  is the class of sports betting podc assits in general these days
GolcondaFund,say what you want about ljax but we will never again see a season like winston had. #30for30
GolcondaFund,"did n overtime post this thought but had this same idea coming into the season.
food for thought..."
GolcondaFund,"a  college football  reality check like what we do for nfl  
and if essler approves i'll buy it."
GolcondaFund,"2018 nfl -- 67.1 percent  underdog spreads picked of 85 games had 68.4 percent  correct.

nonrandomalpha,v. one of the worst most banged up le assit disciplined defenses in the league at the time...
nonrandomalpha,lions a bottom 5 team and panthers a top 7 team? yikes. both are middle of the road.
LeeSharpeNFL,the magic card previewed today is one the steelers would like to have access to this weekend. #wotcstaff
LeeSharpeNFL,on behalf of the nfc north i want to apologize for the state of o you are quarterbacking.
LeeSharpeNFL,unless it hurts the bears playoff chances i will always ro overtime for the vikings against the packers.
LeeSharpeNFL,"houston texans vs. tampa bay buccaneers but the gameplay doubles in speed every time joe thomas says ""momentum""."
LeeSharpeNFL,"will rerun filtering to just ""must win"" teams. but  it is  going to be an even smaller sample."
LeeSharpeNFL,how many nfl head coaches will get fired this year (counting the already-fired jay gruden and ron rivera)?
LeeSharpeNFL,that is  a really brutal way to end the final home football game ever for the oakland raiders.
LeeSharpeNFL,if you need an easy way to follow all the games happening at once i g overtime you:
LeeSharpeNFL,yeah if this looks promising eventually need to test it against the betting market but first things first.
LeeSharpeNFL,"""oh you're using ngs data? i wish i had that.""

""what?  it is  called the eye test nerd."""
LeeSharpeNFL,this feels arbitrary. why 1? i  daily fantasy sports  know that this would make the model more predictive.
LeeSharpeNFL,if someone wrote a darnold is secretly good piece wouldn't the sportswriter's jinx.... cause him to play worse?
LeeSharpeNFL,carr could have thrown the ball away but threw a -1 air yard and 0 yac completion instead.
LeeSharpeNFL,i think i'd move seattle down before moving oakland up? maybe the middle tier needs to be split.
LeeSharpeNFL,"oh wow. this is really neat!

i wish this was available per play vs. an aggregation but nice!"
LeeSharpeNFL,"the lions went for 2 down 8 a free throw er the touchdown! :d

analytics really is winning."
LeeSharpeNFL,hence the n overtime willing to do a thread on it yet. need to explore that more. :)
whale_capper,hahaha each of the team icons is a .png file that you copy paste and move as needed
whale_capper,you have to give away  years old you are balls when you win coach of the year apparently
whale_capper,can you remember a higher leverage penalty this season? looks like you had about a 40 percent  swing
whale_capper,"lol... n overtime sure ""we have an algorithm that can beat the market"" qualifies as a new scam"

whale_capper,i  daily fantasy sports  know but  it is  june so it must be something they play outside right?
whale_capper,how many of you made  years old you are first hockey bet of the year tonight? be honest
whale_capper,the serena stuff had absolutely nothing to do with the competitive balance of a grand slam semi-final match
whale_capper,for sure his win probability for the match swings like 15 percent  n overtime completing set 3 today
whale_capper,seemed like he came alive with that block/dunk sequence but then immediately back to being dominated by horford
AndyMSFW,kinda gotta start perriman this week and brown is a stud  that is  getting targets.  n overtime crazy.
AndyMSFW,the l assit 10 minutes was just one long sequence of a team shitting in their khakis.  #osuvsmich
AndyMSFW,normally i'd make fun of cousins but he had a nice 2nd half considering how the defense played.
AndyMSFW,"""unwatchable by hal free throw ime"" has cashed in 18/22 primetime games this year.  i'll ride that trend."
AndyMSFW,is this the one where belichick quits to coach in green bay?  time will tell on that one
AndyMSFW,i'm also on the under so i'd imagine a scenario where  that is  also in the balance. #prayforandy
AndyMSFW,my final score prediction on the  podcast was 15-8.  i greatly overrated the offenses.   that is  on me.
AndyMSFW,dra free throw ed the denver defense in fantasy so now i'm all in on von for dpoy
AndyMSFW,i think a follow up next off-season might be in order just based on what we've learnt since.
AndyMSFW,"i love that they use the term ""gambling aficionados on twitter"" for o you are little sewer community."
AndyMSFW,...and my tracker because while graphics with pretty ladies are nice spreadsheets automatically add up numbers for me:
AndyMSFW,what kind of psycho sits down a ball park and e against the spread a bowl of soup?
AndyMSFW,someone who had the 1h over must have done something awful on an ancient burial ground or something.
AndyMSFW,-120 is a pretty awful price.  pvam and txsouthern could both be found around +140 or so pre-tournament.

ToddFuhrman,can we blame ryan day for coaching scared throughout the 4th as well? add that to the list...
ToddFuhrman,buyer g overtime 1.9x...no 3-1 here; he's out 4500 so his max payout for his investment is 8500
ToddFuhrman,important to note on the ra point ors game so much is injury related down siakam and powell
ToddFuhrman,believe this is also what it took  to miss the 2018 world cup too so anything is possible
ToddFuhrman,adam does a great job making his audiences smarter.  does solid work with my guy  on matchbook too
ToddFuhrman,i worry about you matt...those long football season hours might be clouding  years old you are judgment some!

TheCousinSal,im cutting the red zone channel from my directv package. too many gross patriots featured between 1-4pm et.
TheCousinSal,ten early games and only three late a free throw ernoon games?  cmon nfl - you're killing us.
TheCousinSal,this is the proper reaction when you have yasiel puig as a teammate for only one more night.
TheCousinSal,raucous applause a free throw er kd went down. yep - canadians are a**holes just like us. #effbieber
TheCousinSal,im anticipating the next giants pick like i would a dave chappelle netflix special. #giddy #nfldra free throw
TheCousinSal,insane final minute to the indy/boston game. pouring one out for those unfortunate bastards with pacers +7.5/8  #gambling
TheCousinSal,another loss.  years old you are contaminated blood bank is flooded with h expected points added titis c.
TheCousinSal,weird - i dont see anyone saying mark sanchez is taking the redskins to the super bowl now.
TheCousinSal,that right tackle moves early every effing play. the thursday and sunday night crews were abysmal this week.
TheCousinSal,the steelers are making this a l overtime harder than it needs to be. catch the effing kickoff!
TheCousinSal,tide up 20 at half laying 28.  and i feel this is an easy cover. do you agree
TheCousinSal,now that th against the spread over with can we all agree that peyton manning sucked? good...moving on.
TheCousinSal,i promise i plan on apologizing to  the second she gets out of her meeting with human resources.
TheCousinSal,im enjoying this francesco molinari performance as much as a chubby man of italian descent possibly can. #britishopen2018
TheCousinSal,check it out degenerate gamblers.  has decided to give away free money! #kimmel #locko free throw heyear #blobfishbasketballclassic
TheCousinSal,it appears lebron and company have decided to celebrate this holiday by getting their mother-effing asses kicked. #nbaonabc
TheCousinSal,stayed away from tigermania.  i have rose (7/1).  has reed (22/1). in other words...casey is winning this thing.
TheCousinSal,and i g overtime to interview the great   he knew the questions before we asked them. so annoying.
TheCousinSal,hard to believe that the cowboys are just a field goal away from re-establishing nfc e assit dominance.
TheCousinSal,another garbage over on a meaningless  touchdown  to end the game. god bless gambling!! # monday night football
TheCousinSal,depending on how this sea/gb mess turns out...billsjags  rams could all have sole possession of 1st place. #footballisback
TheCousinSal,the degenerate trifecta + i wrap up nba nhl betting season +  offers his us open locks. gambling!
TheCousinSal,karnowski has been awful. literally any other game of thrones character would've been an improvement. including tyrion #ncaachampionship

TheCousinSal,ok - maybe i g overtime a little carried away...its just that i love jake paul so much!!
TheCousinSal,i have to be honest..jim thorpe..n overtime nearly as menacing as the history books would have you believe.
TheCousinSal,"underdogs are 5-0 against the spread all-time in these ncaa championship games. 

so...of course im taking lsu -4.5."
12Xpert,wednesdays results will be added tomorrow most probably late unless i find time to update during the day.
12Xpert,there's always debate. if there's no debate life gets boring. at le assit it does for a bayesian.
12Xpert,if the aim was to predict goals scored then surely  it is  relevant to include it if necessary.
12Xpert,whilst they play football as its meant to be played i think i will continue to indulge this.
12Xpert,that is  already been established. which is what makes this so funny. you win some you lose some.
12Xpert,behind paywall. i'm too tight to be able to read but i imagine the answer is pretty obvious.
12Xpert,did i ever say i would do this? bet of the day is basically silly. because of variance.
12Xpert,i very much doubt it but best price held about 4 percent  value according the the woc method.
12Xpert,about to do it. was just waiting for yesterday's games to finish and forg overtime to update yesterday.
12Xpert,really fascinating subject this. i suppose the next question is then how long does it take to evolve?
12Xpert,i expect that betfair exchange and other in-play platforms would have suspended their betting markets during that period.
JambosPicks,"tfw the first  sunday is finally here 

subscribers can see today's recommended #nfl and #mlb plays at !"
JambosPicks,better than that #athletics-#royals has already hit the over 9.5 (weather permitting)... and its only the 3rd inning
JambosPicks,"...and the #twins triu miles per ho you are 6-3! th against the spread another jambos winner! 

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,"when you recommended the over in #rays-#padres and they've already scored 5 runs in the 1st inning. 

 #gamblingtwitter"
JambosPicks,yes awesome but you couldn't have waited for a day we didn't recommend the #mets on the ml?
mschwimer,n overtime at all selling the game of the week. just a podc assit thing. free for everyone.
mschwimer,should be a very large media platform to come out with a story on us tomorrow. stay tuned.
mschwimer,please see the 3 part tweet i just sent.  big news on the guarantee! we are making moves.
mschwimer,if it was an attem point  to scam why did i change it instantly? literally makes no sense.
mschwimer,saw that and love it!  plus a little half point winner in kawhi was nice in best bets!
mschwimer,that is actually a good question.  all of the jambos st against the spread are adjusted for opponent.
mschwimer,jordan is 2 off the lead in his home tournament. being broadcasted live in 4k if you have
mschwimer,"im very glad i do n overtime own any apple products.  wow this is some scary stuff.
.co/qfl8wnoayn"
mschwimer,"hey steve i had a quick question for you if you had a minute.
thanks and good luck"
mschwimer,i have everything from 2014 but i'm sporadic before then. someone needs to make a website for this
mschwimer,i love canadians! i will be applying for citizenship so i can be  years old you are teammate!
mschwimer,at the bruce concert in tampa... god i love the boss... seeing him every year is a must
mschwimer,""" my first journal into the season if you missed it! xo .co/zm1kmzgb"" my girl doin big things!"
mschwimer,on the bus back to clearwater for the next 30 min... wh against the spread up in twitterville?
mschwimer,off to watch the games with  at 3rd base in austin... j e t s jets jets jets
mschwimer,thanks everyone for the encouragement... the first part of my life dream has come true. i cant wait!!!!
mschwimer,g overtime saved by the iron pig offense... will take the team win any day of the week
RufusPeabody,when i woke up today i didnt know it would be a zylbo day. but it is
RufusPeabody,schwimer still hasn't answered my questions. just like his article didn't address  years old you are points.
RufusPeabody,orioles farm system in the late 90s. he was all about trading away the future for veterans.
RufusPeabody,drinking a celebration ale and trying to understand how companies can produce such crappy college basketball data
RufusPeabody,we've always discussed the tout industry and the tricks touts use to try to pad their records.
RufusPeabody,have you met  he says he's the best. you say you're the best. who do i believe?
RufusPeabody,most of my bets are right around even money odds. i'm typically risking $5500 to win $5000
RufusPeabody,if you are assuming the closing line is 100 percent  efficient. which is certainly n overtime true.
RufusPeabody,i wish i could track my picks on there. alas making my predictions public would be self-defeating.
RufusPeabody,agree on southern miss; no plays on the other two but lean  years old you are way.
RufusPeabody,i mean my  college football  is losing today too so jambos and i have that in common.
RufusPeabody,non-verifiable record from december of l assit year is n overtime particularly relevant.  that is  my point.
RufusPeabody,i like the taylormade project a. also pro v if it feels warranted based on my play.
RufusPeabody,it still counts! does it count if you just hit a bajillion balls off the tee? no.
RufusPeabody,do you really think a book could offer -125/-125 on nfl sides and get any real handle?
RufusPeabody,i agree that that has entertainment value to people. i was talking about most people selling picks.
RufusPeabody,the fact that you dont understand why winning bettors wouldnt want to post their picks says everything.
RufusPeabody,schwimer is right  he is revolutionizing the tout industry with new and visionary grading and accounting methods
RufusPeabody,if you just blindly bet unders for every prop in the playoffs you'd have done much better
RufusPeabody,what people rationally know and what they act on are o free throw en very different things.
RufusPeabody,you say the sky is green. i say the sky is blue. differences of opinion are fine.
jeffma,nothing like loading the bottom of the order with zero hits. seattle bullpen 2019 at its finest
jeffma,but you started this whole argument by saying there were playoffs today implying the system was fine
jeffma,how much was  years old you are girlfriend barber able to get down... asking for a friend
jeffma,recorded the  podcast this am. spoiler alert: we are against them on at le assit one pick
jeffma,. thought this would brighten  years old you are day and distract you from that other lunacy
jeffma,here's why  years old you are analysis is wrong and bear with me because this is complicated
jeffma,i  daily fantasy sports  know what you are talking about. i  daily fantasy sports  watch the bachelor
jeffma,xavier/st. johns game screwed up... and this one cann overtime be chalked up to the obscure category
SportsCheetah,huh? he had him beat but was turning around since it was so underthrown and then slipped.
SportsCheetah,62 percent  from 3 vs 13 percent  from 3 on 26 and 22 attem points  is wild
SportsCheetah,n overtime now they're down 17 with 6 mins. was a bad number entering the 4q though.
SportsCheetah,may the gambling gods have mercy on  years old you are furman backing souls here in ot
SportsCheetah,he may be valuing win against okie state's backup qb as significant enough to leap utah tuesday.
SportsCheetah,3:40-12:10 inadvertently some stuff on what i was referring to the other day: happiness positive expected value
SportsCheetah,kawhi 7/21 and clippers 3/23 from 3 as a team and only down 1 is fairly impressive.
SportsCheetah,clearly everybody is aware already but in case you missed it somehow tyus jones revenge game tonight.
SportsCheetah,i can check my exact projections later but my guess is it happens 67-70 percent  or so.
SportsCheetah,i do. we talk over the stats/trends etc. that are and arent predictive all of the time.
SportsCheetah,if that was because the gb db said something about ertzs mom eject him for the season.
SportsCheetah,can we get a mini-gameday in two weeks app state at ull wednesday night sun belt action?
SportsCheetah,ahhh understood. hopefully this faceless guy is wrong i have an over 6 wins bet to cash.
capjack2000,fitting considering neither dra free throw kings nor james dolan have a history of risking much money.

capjack2000,"who needs high vig when you can have low limits?

...they'd be much more comfortable."
capjack2000,"a quote im fond of:

capjack2000,tl:dr version - its an unsustainable product if there are better o point ions for the consumer.
capjack2000,"""n overtime long ago"" if compared to the evolution of a species or the formation of gemstones..."
capjack2000,"how could i n overtime like any tweet that includes the use of ""yosh"" as a verb."
capjack2000,"even my dog wants to read this book. 

had to pick up one for the office library."
capjack2000,anyone else in #gamblingtwitter planning to attend the all-american sports betting summit in nj next month? #aasbs2019
capjack2000,i agree with this. all three were solid and each had their own original conce points .
capjack2000,i've always ke point  this issue because i've considered it the federalist papers towards sports betting legalization...
capjack2000,and the people setting the betting limits have to wait until 1am for the games to start!
capjack2000,"clear  years old you are schedules for 6pm et/3pm  point  today...#gamblingtwitter will be in flames.

capjack2000,ok good. one less thing i have to implement when i get my appointed to my position.
dinkinc,rare hockey post for the  horses...winnipeg over 6 -10...lean winnipeg as well but over is much better
dinkinc,you present so well.   as if its a passion and n overtime a job.  big things ahead
dinkinc,wow....i thought it was because you lie and tweet constantly about yourself.... glad you cleared that up
dinkinc,i need to go for sure.... i looked into it this year but the dates didn't work
dinkinc,0-2 for the  horses including an under bet in a 12-11 slugfest ...embarrassing day to be sure
dinkinc,racing is so hard now.  i admire  years old you are success in both betting and owning
dinkinc,charting some pitching stats.... monday's game at texas featured minor-leake.. wonder if anyone called a plumber ?
dinkinc,3-0 mlb   1-0 nhl....   the only sweat the   horses have is no earthquake in dodger town ...
robpizzola,id lose my mind (in a good way) if they could use technology to figure this out.
robpizzola,would rather watch episode 2 on repeat for a week straight than endure episode 1 ever again.
robpizzola,"next generation game.

gotta show these young fans what its really like to cheer for the leafs."
robpizzola,at le assit he would have been clapping a free throw er that two yard gain. #positivejason
robpizzola,troy aikman had 100 concussions in his career and hes going to defend that play by floyd?
robpizzola,whenever youve lost five in a row you gotta play cody ceci as much as humanly possible.
robpizzola,im diabetic so i try to do the same... could be a matter of life or death!
robpizzola,he can play any type of ball he wants. its effective. th against the spread the point.
robpizzola,yes which is the main reason hes a liability. cant read a defense to save his life.
robpizzola,that third timeout is way more important than the chance (extremely slim) that that play gets overturned.
robpizzola,i didnt... that doesnt change the fact that i would have never traded up in that spot.
robpizzola,th against the spread exactly what he said and now hes backtracking because people are clowning him.
robpizzola,there are so many things wrong with this comparison that i wouldnt even know where to start.
robpizzola,also even more incentive on offshores to operate fairly now that they are competing against regulated books.
robpizzola,mix some peanut butter with some razor blades and sugar and you essentially have the same thing.
robpizzola,he actually still lives in buffalo and drives across the border for all of their home games.
robpizzola,still three days le free throw . if his putter goes away then he's gonna free fall.
RASPicks,seriously?  we are n overtime affiliated with any such thing.  can you take a photo of it?
RASPicks,about 80 percent  of offscreen market is up n overtime worth waiting for any more than that.
RASPicks,"finding this very hard to believe.  is it just for this game or all the ""extra"" sides?"
RASPicks,outside shooting looks like it could be challenging on the uss carl vinson even if no wind.

ProfessorShine,am sports betting info out of small town nm is gonna blow up soon i feel it
ProfessorShine,announcers n overtime even considering the decision is always baffling.  n overtime saying its an easy choice.
ProfessorShine,i cant tell if taco bells brand is that strong or espn just doesnt give a shit

suuma810,there are several teams who would drastically improve in that area if they hired a madden pro.
suuma810,i've read that this morning. if they really start howard  scharping at guard good luck with that.
suuma810,imagine n overtime being excited one bit for the matchup of the contrary extremes in offensive philosophy.
suuma810,great podc assit by    discussing some obvious topics surrounding the browns going into the off-season. enjoyed it!
suuma810,das hrt man  free throw ers von defense-coaches. prio ist ja auch immer den run zu stoppen.
suuma810,according to current reports the snow will stop soon which should make up for a good pitch.
suuma810,they also played an easy 4th-place schedule just like jax did. their offensive dvoa schedule ranks 32nd.
suuma810,on touchdown-drives the vikes had a pass rate of 68 percent  this year 12.5 percent  above league-average.
suuma810,let the next oc try to get the best out of blake bortles and a run-first approach.
suuma810,arguably the worst passing defense will be without two of their three best pass rushers on sunday.
suuma810,imagine they beat out the giants for the potential best qb in the dra free throw .
suuma810,#rams right tackle rob havenstein ranks 1st in pass block win rate this season. awesome new metric!
suuma810,i  daily fantasy sports  think the run game will make a big difference. here is my reasoning:
suuma810,probably too early yeah. but i didn't like the giants pick at all at the time though.
ClevTA,that 15m drive to independence for someone who doesnt have a job must be a major pain!

RufusPeabody,exce point  you can't see the ones from when the model was ready. just the record.
RufusPeabody,they are creating unique data that tries to isolate the value of different players. worthwhile endeavor.
RufusPeabody,his answers arent as long. and no candidate attacks him so he never gets the rebuttal.
RufusPeabody,th against the spread what simple bet is doing now? seems miles from where they started
RufusPeabody,but is that what they should do? the nfl playoffs dont have the best 12 teams.
RufusPeabody,how so? you get the ball to start the second half regardless of if you convert.
RufusPeabody,i wouldnt be able to place that same bet at dk. i wouldnt want to either.
RufusPeabody,he raised $23 million because bla was successful. people back people who have made them money.

RufusPeabody,bland hasn't held a solo 54-hole lead but is 0-for-2 with a share of 54-hole lead
RufusPeabody,is the market inefficient enough that you can win (or lose) just based on that though?
RufusPeabody,berry isn't selling picks though. he realized there's more money on the betting side of things.

suuma810,the scoring didnt match up with the efficiency it was expected to regress at some point.
suuma810,why would you run the ball and gain fewer yards when you need to outscore mahomes?
suuma810,100 percent  agree. its like schotty doesnt know what to call when the run doesnt work.

suuma810,by getting one single yard they cant score a touchdown a free throw erwards.

capjack2000,i would likely get approved for $25 more. sometimes $0 more.
