PikachuBets,"lol trust me i'm not even trying to tailing his plays. i'm just super annoyed that a first-year  $ 5 0 0  tout is trying to claim bol openers and stale lines as part of his ""public record"" which he'll then use to advertise for more tout money. do you not see how that is shady?",277
PikachuBets,oh hmmmmm idk lemme check my car trunk and see. oh wait a minute i know how about touting  $ 5 0 0  for an untested mlb model only 9  months after he learned how to code??? lets start there. also tweeting bol openers bc its good value. yeah no shit thats why its an opener.,273
PikachuBets,major twitter whores always end up posting stale stuff. yes he will be steam this year but that ain't what i'm talking about. he already posted stale w/ season win totals last week all 3  were 1 -2  weeks out. his unit inflating is also off the charts lmao 2 0  units  plays. get a clue.,287

oh wait there's no way your ass knows how to code lmao",277
PikachuBets,i told you i reported you already lol. didnt know twitter actually does anything with it but it just goes to show how big of a cunt you were when i report for spam but you get locked for harassment. you still wanna be raging boners to each other or does this apology still hold?,278
PikachuBets,as someone who has ev and analytics in his twitter name lets just say 1 ) you are not the target audience for this game and 2 ) you have nothing in common with the degens who will flock all over this and thus 3 ) your opinion on market realities is way off target,263
PikachuBets,"whew matt you work too hard. monitoring lines ""all day"" using vegasinsider or tan instead of db alerts sounds like a lot of work! and you have to meet your early morning deadline too. imagine how much easier life would be if you'd just bet your 6 0  %  plays for a living. oh wait..",282
PikachuBets,i learned this the hard way. used to live bet to chase  lost slightly vig. but i looked back at how much of life i missed out on by uselessly sweating those plays and the answer became clear. if it's not clear get someone to help you see it thru. don't live this life alone,273
PikachuBets,yeah yeah your plays were so dominant for so long but you still had to switch jobs recently to negotiate for more salary. anyway matt do you have an answer re: getting down more on your dominant plays? i asked around we can help you do 2 0  thousand  a pop if you'd like. lmk,275
PikachuBets,i see we have moved from substance to full ad hominems. no biggie. we heard each other already and i don't have any beef w/ you. i'll leave you w/ this tho what does it say about my transparency that you found my losing streak so easily? how many twitter guys do that? good day,277
PikachuBets,love cit/cbi/wncaa lines are easier to beat. i watch all game film for analysis. objectively cit  w tourney. 5 0 -pt blowouts 3 0  % efg in r6 4 /r3 2  is trash to watch.  % enjoyable games b/w the 2  are probably near equal. i love supporting wncaa but early rounds are just unwatchable,287
PikachuBets,so i see you found time to spend 1  hr on periscope even tho you said you didn't have time to work out details of our bet. wanna share some thoughts now on what you said you'd think about two days ago? only 4  days left before opening day don't backtrack on your challenge now,276
PikachuBets,"done. 3 5  units  on 1  units  base. but you are cucking already. now propose a third party arbitrator for us and dont make it some scum friend of yours.

also classic too busy excuse. can host 3 0 -min periscopes cant send some twitter replies to work out a deal. kk np ill bite",279
PikachuBets,"that is a great honor but having been active on twitter for 6  months ""all time"" is hardly accurate. you sound like one of those guys who start people goat after they go on a 3 -week hot streak.

p.s. we'll see who's the real troll if berry doesn't take me up on his challenge",276
PikachuBets,if yale is worse than 1 3  seed i'll throw a twitter hissy fit. penn 1 6  seed last year was garbage dumpster fire blue blood biased dog shit. that was a round of 3 2  team if the opponent weren't kansas. do some good committee. show us you maybe kinda sometimes know math (doubtful),283
PikachuBets,are you sure about that? the one and done guys today dont need 4  years to develop. the ones that did (jevon carter grayson allen) played college ball and made it. those nba legends prob could be one and done and make it all the same. players are still doing 4 yrs to get drafted,279
PikachuBets,yes i know lol. im pointing out the irony in your complaint. if you take the position youre currently taking then college ball is going to suck. bc theyre not trying to be what you want them to be. but if you change the way you look at it its not all a joke anymore,265
PikachuBets,you are angry like 1 0 0  %  of the time. calm down and take a chill pill. i asked a question and was hoping for discussion. no need to keep asserting your age and yell at me about diapers. death also comes w/ age so be careful what you're bragging about over there ok?,269
PikachuBets,knowing what constitutes +ev makes watching many of these game shows impossible. these sisters just turned down this round: double  $ 1 1 1  thousand  to  $ 2 2 2  thousand  if correct halve to  $ 5 5 .5  thousand  if wrong. they even thought the category was doable not impossible. lol im weeping jeez,302

PikachuBets,not a pro but work with many. nfl tough to judge bc it takes like 3  seasons to get a large enough sample size and by then you might not have any edge left. even pros know there is value to winning in the short-term. after all in the long run were all dead,256
PikachuBets,i know there isn't any bad blood but almost every time this comes up on your feed it becomes a gigantic circle jerk over the same arguments from ed/his supporters and you and back and forth and back and forth. almost as stale as the shit i took last night is all i'm saying,273

PikachuBets,what? no. what the fuck are you talking about. when your show goes on the air whatever the line is then thats what you should be using. how are you being transparent? if nobody calls you out then you ride it as if -1 2  was valid when you were on the air. wtf,259
PikachuBets,where did he say this in the thread? where did he say or even imply he did not want to debate you in public? you're not worth of his podcast your opinions are not worth airtime and definitely not worth the free pr that his podcast would give you. kindly fuck off very much,272
PikachuBets,"lol inb4  you go on a bad run and either 1 ) change the record and have your top 1 0  audit firm look the other way or 2 ) go back and rewrite your tos to make it scammy since it can be changed at any point in time.

what a fucking joke",236
PikachuBets,or how about you reply to any of the comments i've left you? don't play the pussy game of picking and choosing which comments to respond to. must be a nice hill to die on sticking by your statement like a retard when it's been shit on 5 0 0  times  by others already,266
PikachuBets,this is a cause/effect fallacy. anyone hitting 5 6  %  on large enough samples (generally 1 0 0 0  for lln to refute null) is only able to do so bc they are on right side of market more often than not capturing market inefficiencies. gl hitting that  %  if you're always getting worse,284

PikachuBets,same method afaik. after taking a shit he turns to count how many turds are floating on the left right upper or lower parts of the bowl. each part has a play associated with it. saturdays can be real tough for him takes a lot of feces and flushing to generate all the plays,273

PikachuBets,do you really not get it? its really not difficult. the guy who made this must be a drop dead fucking lifetime loser who is rich. like he definitely bets huge amounts and just torches money. if you consistently win they wont even book 5 0 0  let alone 1 5 0  thousand ,268
PikachuBets,then you'd know there are hardly any buy side jobs for fresh grads. avg expectation is 2 -yr sell side then try jump to buy side. hence key part is to get into ib for a college kid. the entry-level stuff is what i'm talking about. keep moving goalposts to talk about bridgewater,278
PikachuBets,"on second read sure you want to stand by this? the standard for getting into ib hf pe is ""are you smart""? u srs? 8 0  %  of target school kids are smart (giving generous 2 0  %  as trust fund types). these princeton football bros aren't getting into gs bc they're ""smart""",271

PikachuBets,"""i don't want to buy something i can read very quickly bc i can't catch up on the other stuff i do already pay for"" is a bad excuse. maybe just pay for the shit you know you're gonna use? which obv includes his article since you attempted to click on it already",261
PikachuBets,this is a fucking bullshit argument and you know it. the answer to idiots touting on big media outlets is not to turn tout yourself and show them up. you are touting bc its easy guaranteed money. be a man and owe up to what youre doing. or be a lying two-faced cuck.,266

PikachuBets,the fact that you are showing me some simplistic bball-ref definition to make whatever point you're trying to make basically proves my point. you have no idea what ts %  shows or how to interpret it. saying ts %  is misleading bc his fg %  is better is a fucking joke. go home,276

PikachuBets,all right jemele its time to put your money where your big mouth is. youll bet on taurasi any day? lets do a bet. how about loser donates 5  thousand  to a charity of the winners choice? bet will be over/under phoenix mercury season wins we can decide on a mutually agreeable  lmk,280
PikachuBets,"here's football. notice it's not ""nfl"" or ""cfb"" since he has now purposely combined the two trackers to eke out a breakeven record (they were separate b4 ). spoiler: his nfl is way down. note he refuses to even show dates with his plays! complete obfuscation. nfl season cost  $ 5 0 0",284
PikachuBets,4  weeks (oct 2 1 -nov 1 7 ) worth of screenshots from just one of many accts. 6 5 0  plays maybe even 7 0 0 . up more money than you've ever gambled in your life  i expect your  $ 1  thousand  paypal by tonight. easiest dime i've ever made.,241
PikachuBets,accordingly in honor of this tilt i feel in my jimmies at the moment as i ingest the delicious odor of this fatso sandwiched next to me we will spray the board tmrw in cbb while my in-laws bitch about how hoppin john doesnt go well with prosciutto. fuck you felicia bye,269
PikachuBets,dug can i just say fuck you very much. you make loads of money off the back of college athletes when you talk about them using your airtime and platform. you are a direct beneficiary of the college sports industrial complex and you have the audacity to say inane shit like this?,278
PikachuBets,"your bio has ""signal and noise."" you of all people should understand that the tails do not make the rule. you can always point to endless examples of dbag nobodies who made it. what you can't point to are the millions of randos you don't even know the names of who didn't.",272
PikachuBets,you've said nothing to refute my point that going to elite schools unlocks a key part of the recruiting process to these high-end jobs other than to go ad hominem against me. you're an old guy who doesn't know how it works for younger guys in school now so let's just stop.,273
PikachuBets,hm not sure maybe bc he  fl retweets and shares the same dumbass bullshit voodoo from tan? i'll stand corrected that he beats props np. but doing his contest requires being looped into the tan ecosystem which will 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  %  make you more stupid,256
PikachuBets,it is also a fact that if we had not pointed all of this out today you would've ran with that horrific version of the tcs and all of your customers would have zero legal recourse to get their guarantee. a fuckup of this magnitude cannot possibly be an oversight. fuck off,271
PikachuBets,but go on keep selling the dream and making people believe that paying you to enter their shitty ass picks into a guaranteed monies contest is worth their money and time. also keep showing off dat wad of cash on tv in your car! keep buying hooks keep hanging w/ lv touts,270
PikachuBets,"did you even look? i have a sheet. its not fully updated. public plays still down on the year but not as much as the sheet shows in june.

how am i misleading and who am i misleading? fuck off i dont misrepresent anything. if you wanna criticize me fucking try harder.",268
PikachuBets,"so what is it you want to address directly? our opinion on shoe culture differ. you view it differently than i do. that has been established. if you were looking for a ""i'm right you're wrong i'm sorry"" kind of conversation you've barked up the wrong tree. that's not fun at all",278
PikachuBets,right back at you. the hilarious part of this lol is that you wouldn't give a shit so much about how i've lost in wnba unless you were tailing the plays yourself. maybe if you use your own brain to bet you wouldn't have to take out your angst on someone else,258
PikachuBets,if you werent such a fucking fraud scum tout then ppl wouldnt hate. going on interviews talking like youre a hotshot but all you do is peddle bullshit like i grind so hard and you just need to know when to get out and then justifying touting. just fucking stop you skinhead,273
PikachuBets,uh also using a court case as a proxy for does this argument hold logically is also a piss poor fallacy. the us legal system is one of the most bulky and slow with the highest transactional costs in the world. whether a judge throws it out immediately lol doesnt mean shit,272
PikachuBets,to continue subjective circlejerk...nbl avg attendance 6  thousand . bbl avg attendance 4  thousand . there are nbl stadiums that only sit 4 -5  thousand . that shit doesn't mean anything. just bc you visited a really small shitty bbl stadium doesn't mean the league is shit. lol. get a clue man,295
PikachuBets,also that is a tweet from april and youre ripping me for it now? get a fucking life. stop being obsessed with me. you are a meathead who is past his prime and cant face the music. have fun tweeting to absolutely nobody and getting almost zero responses on your tweets lmao,272
PikachuBets,its 1 0 0  %  a scam and has always been. . promised a couple of months ago when he finally responded to criticisms about his ico scam that he would put up evidence or whatever. obv nothing was ever given bc he ran a fucking scam and made bank on it,249

PikachuBets,"the problem:

you: ""i am so smart so much sharper than the market that if the market moves against me i'm not worried. in fact i love when this happens bc it means i like my play even more and now there is more value.""

rest of the world: ""you're retarded bye""",260
PikachuBets,congratz. hey look i get it man a free iphone game is really all you can afford after all the begging you do for venmo tips. keep collecting retarded followers by ripping off 5 3 8 s shitty baseball projections and slapping kelly stakes on top of them. so proud of you!!,270
PikachuBets,"anyone good enough to kill the market for as long as you claim would be a thriving pro. eg   also started from nothing 1 0  yrs ago which is your claim. a) you're not that great or b) you're an idiot  need to seriously reflect on what you're doing with your ""talent.""",267
PikachuBets,"great. so now we have you on the record quoting lines from singular slow-moving lv books and an ace2 3  skin. are you ever going to start using wa lines or are you going to keep playing the eenie meenie minie moe game for the rest of your sad ""betting analyst"" life?",266

PikachuBets,"stop lecturing all of us as if we can't read. we did. 3 0  min before you tweeted your line was already stale.  beat me to quoting lines below. come on man. you're making it real hard to buy the whole ""i am not here to scam anyone"" claim by the minute.",252
PikachuBets,first play of the season and already going full scum tout with fake berry kelly stakes. line is only available right now as a bol opener at  $ 2 5 0  limit but he is betting 2 2 .7 4  units wowowowow. also lmao at 5  mlb units is a regular unit,244
PikachuBets,i read what you wrote. you dont understand how these things go down. you dont understand that generating fire during the comment period is the only real way to fight bad regs. its clear youve never really had a big dge dispute. i read it all right and its a bad take,266
PikachuBets,at the level he is trying to get down per play there's zero room for scaling. he had to ask twitter for people's outs in order to get enough down. no room for 5  units  bombs. pros also do not scale; it is simply just impossible enough already to get down large.,262
PikachuBets,no one is making a living betting into the highest limits at efficiency let alone in nfl. also if i lived in europe i wouldn't use cris...i'd be matching on an exchange like mbook or one of the larger asian ones. staying on screen in america just isn't feasible due to scale,274
PikachuBets,those statistics are wrong far more than 3 3  %  jobs req college. but point taken. yet if most of us shouldnt go college our parents didnt tell us. so how come its the same ppl in our parents generation telling us how were a bunch of lazy fucktards? bit ironic huh,265
PikachuBets,a guy that deserves props (and a power 6  job) is yales james jones. the guy is 1 3 6 -6 9  at yale in the past 6  1 /2  seasons and has gone to a pair of ncaa tournaments. yale is 1 6 -4  overall and 4 -0  in the ivy.,218

PikachuBets,"what an absolute breakdown by portland st down the stretch. 2  min no score from 4 :2 7  to 2 :1 7  and giving up 6 5  %  shooting while wasting their +1 4  oreb margin (!!!) is quite impressive.

PikachuBets,did you just compare jumbo bozos to billy walters. they don't move the market. they don't bet their own picks. there is nothing to fucking middle if you don't move the market. lol. dude you can't read espn chalk articles  use these fancy words when you don't know what they mean,278
PikachuBets,worst thing about betting basketball home dogs is that they try super duper hard at the end of games to force ot which just gives them 5 -1 0  more min (yes in europe some ots are a full 1 0  min) to dick around and fuck the cover no lube,238
PikachuBets,also those picks from february are still not public. nobody knows what you played or claim to played. those cbb wins account for almost 6 5 -7 0  %  of your cbb total profit that youre still advertising as lifetime gains every single week. give me a fucking break about transparency,282
PikachuBets,"that's why i'm saying you're moving the goalposts...i was just talking about getting in. never said ""you will make it thru the ranks and jump from sell to buy side with a good pedigree."" that doesn't necc means it's worth doing time for. this entire thing was irrelevant to my pt",279
PikachuBets,and boy do you love mentioning that my gambling schtick is focusing on shitty small markets and the implication that this must mean i am poor! man that must make you feel so manly and proud and jumping to go buy some trojan magnum xls. what a swell guy you are,260
PikachuBets,my read on you is that you're a middle-aged guy who's done well for himself thru betting/job/investing or all of them but to come in here swinging as if you have any clue what the current entry-level job landscape is for these shops at elite schools is a fucking joke lol,271

PikachuBets,fuck you. we ain't avoiding shit. you're the one dodging behind legal protections. you waive all legal liability mandate an arbitration process thru your own arbitrator limit damages to  $ 5  thousand  when guarantee is  $ 1 0  thousand . this is why you won't accept anything outside of your website.,301

PikachuBets,you wonder why it is that you often get a worse line bc the market has moved against you? just like the way you try to predict that a line will get worse after your article is published? hmm same i wonder why that is as well. its such a mystery!,245
PikachuBets,well no you cant be fine with everything you said. if you were then youd lay -8 0 0  on this bet just like you said you would. dont berry out on me bro. live up to the things you say and dont chicken out once someone calls your fucking bluff,241

PikachuBets,watch more games you blithering nfl fanboy. ucla and wsu last night neither are shitty teams and no they werent the equivalent of phx-nyk. its so clear you dont watch enough mid-level cfb games. there are 1 3 2  fbs cfb teams and tons of functional good football to watch,271
PikachuBets,also your tweet is wrong. you locked in a line for 6  hours before air. why are you saying its transparent by not locking in lines. you locked the line at -1 2  but it was clearly -1 3 .5  in the entire world when you were on the air.,234

PikachuBets,it's not bc we lost a conference game or two...it's bc they're a bunch of shit brains who don't understand analytics who refuse to acknowledge the great work done by giants in the field who live on narratives to rate this tournament and don't give a shit what people say.,271
PikachuBets,"your wifes family is undoubtedly white. guess what black ppl came here as immigrants too generations ago and they also worked super hard in the cotton fields! oh wait...

black ppl have drive all the same. the doors are shut. its not a black and white argument just a caveat",274
PikachuBets,at some point big man you just need to admit that you dont know enough math you dont know enough statistics you def dont know any programming and you dont know anything really about the betting markets to ever be profitable. hope your tan check and nfl pension last forever,273
PikachuBets,understood. times change. as times change the way you evaluate things should change as well. if college players are no longer all primed to go nba then theres no point in saying wow they suck theyre not nba-level lol. theyre not trying to be. barking up the wrong tree man,272
PikachuBets,its terrible not because i said so but because its not the goal of college basketball. coaches across the board are not telling their players this is how to get to the nba. theyre just coaching and playing college ball. theyre not trying to be at nba level at all.,264
PikachuBets,okay. what im saying though is using nba as the endpoint for judging college teams is misguided since youre only judging 1  %  of players. that doesnt make any sense. judge college for college not how many nba players there are...just go watch the nba if you want nba lol,271
PikachuBets,wrong. just stop. you dont know what the fuck youre talking about. all the money is moved off screen these days. lines dont move now bc someone is double tapping cris repeatedly. they move when the sharp info comes in from the pphs. you have zero clues. please shut up,268
PikachuBets,"here's some sheep who looked at scamkon's winning seasons and said ""wow shrap"". so dangerous. take it from someone who knows how to torch a season after pillaging the year before ('sup wnba): one season ain't donkey shit. (also wow i said ""in 5  years"" lol more like 9  months)",277
PikachuBets,heyo! let's check in on our favorite clueless sack of tout. how's life been for dear ol'  he's been very quiet! i got so much hate mail for shitting on him all last year. we all know how mlb went (spoiler: not well) but...he's proven at nfl and cbb rite?,254
PikachuBets,i love hating on scum but this ain't it. been on /r/sportsbook reddit for longer than i care to admit   schtick been the same for 4  seasons. plenty of other martingale retards - touts yes but none even come close to the humor and energy that cp brings. lgtb!,259

PikachuBets,man do whatever you want with your money but  telling everyone what a great service she runs and provides as a contest proxy is almost as hilarious as her defending buying points in nfl and tweeting out a chart of push rates as proof of the nfl 5  lol,251
PikachuBets,still going with the cause/effect fallacy. you are a long-term winner because of your ability to capture +clv inefficiencies before they are corrected. it's not two-way. you're +profit bc you're +clv but 1 0 0  %  not vice versa. +clv comes first and is thus the best proxy heuristic,283

PikachuBets,eddie stfu and go copy someone elses plays like the pathetic bottom-feeder tout you are. youre not the only fucker who knows that pinny deals better juice. its called paying a price to get down more and hiding from the screen. not that you would know you fucking copycat,270

PikachuBets,then i also think rufus is afforded the leniency of not understanding how his shitty tout setup works this whole 3 0 -min on twitter after real releases sort of thing. sammie replies to everyone as if how he works should be common knowledge...when he is a nobody lol,266

PikachuBets,pretty dominating play from yale so far. spreading the floor well moving the ball quickly keeping sloppiness to a minimum. defense needs to keep a tighter zone formation in 2 h and watch for stephens/aririguzoh to keep the differential up tho. also...u1 4 3  pls ty ty ty,271

PikachuBets,this is not how betting works. utterly useless information. lmfao at martingaling up to  $ 4 2 5  thousand  wagers on a fucking nhl total. this tweet and the amount of likes its gotten embodies everything thats wrong with gambling twitter and the analysts who cover it. gross,275
PikachuBets,my conclusion is fuck the old fucks who think they get to shit on young ppl. thats all i wanted to rant about. im just on twitter to bet on sports not about to do sociological theory with yall or submit some labor econ abstract. great discussions though!,254
PikachuBets,once again i didnt disagree with you that those players were very good better than today. my question was and still is should the ncaa be judged for what their players do in the nba? or should they be judged by different standards altogether? very different questions man,271
PikachuBets,sure i get that. seeing college players duke it out as nba players is awesome. but that wasnt my question so lets focus. is producing nba players what college teams should be judged on? or should teams just be judged on their level of play as college teams?,257
PikachuBets,op i agree. one terrible 2 h showing really can knock a blue blood off its high horse. big-time. erases the whole seasons performance for sure. time to start talking about how uk can squeeze in a borderline at-large bid here maybe even be in the first four.,257
PikachuBets,no. 2 h lines are universal and accessible to everyone. niche off market live lines that come out to be the equivalent 2 h bet are not widely available to all. this is a very key difference even if the numbers work out to functionally be the same.,247
PikachuBets,"thought my question was clear. 1 ) on what basis on you estimating an ""average profit per month""? 2 ) how do you know your potential customers' avg unit size? 3 ) given the above how did you decide that ~6  units  is a fair price? simple questions.",248
PikachuBets,could betting non-american sports on pph get any worse? grand slam semifinals 1 0  min to tip half of these books still only taking 2 5 0  on sides. why even fucking bother.  on the other hand 5  thousand  sides 5  thousand  totals 1 0  thousand  ml. jeez,255

PikachuBets,at some point you just have to admit that you are old and uneducated and ignorant and that hmmmm maybe all of this stuff you didn't spend years working on and developing might be worth a little more than you'd think it is. the hubris is deafening.,247
PikachuBets,"come on you can't be serious writing this off as a ""mistake"" that they're allowed to make. this was a not so subtle ineptitude that shows you how little they care about protecting their customers. that's an immediate loss of credibility. don't care it was ""fixed."" non-negotiable",279
PikachuBets,because when push comes to shove and customers need to demand their money guarantee any executive with half a brain would simply pull up the original signed tos and say the contract is insufficient/unclear in x/y/z. your twitter words have zero teeth. you know this. come on.,275
PikachuBets,simply put your tos is a pos. just so many internal inconsistencies and fundamentally not legally airtight as your screaming we put money where our mouth is. no. you do not. your tos protects you and leaves very little for the customer. this got multimillion funding? pathetic,276
PikachuBets,"lol wtf. 2  scenarios:

1 . playing dumb. financial ""typos"" were trying to freeroll to see if anyone would notice. if not use tos to screw them

2 . company so fucking inept they can't get incredibly important financial numbers correct

both conclusions? avoid like the plague",276
PikachuBets,nobody says this. nobody thinks this. nobody. nobody is arguing that +clv = 5 5  %  hit rate. at least nobody honest; scammers will say anything but who gives a shit? stop fighting a straw man you just sound like a bigger idiot than you already are.,249
PikachuBets,this is not an area where subjective opinions matter. you are a participant in a highly efficient market. you are bound by the realities of that market which is in turn defined by statistical probabilities. reality = market knows what it's doing. you need +clv to win,267

PikachuBets,every major market gets more difficult every single year with or without meatheads like berry. he had zero impact. market started to ignore his moves barely a month into the season. this guy is a blip in the betting universe and he accomplished nothing except torching money,274
PikachuBets,yes oops my bad. but the point stands that the coefficient isn't comparable across different eras even in the same league. idk what  % impact it would actually have on the ts %  but there's no question you can't just compare them across 2 0 + years,248
PikachuBets,this is a bad take. you dont think if you gave out a sooper doper seekrit nuggt here that somebody would leak it to twitter? audience is hardly signing ndas lol. either way this is gonna end with spanky asking for accts on stage amirite or amirite,247
PikachuBets,he's also been intentionally deceptive multiple times and i've called him out on a lot of it. particularly regarding our  $ 1 0  thousand  bet which he wanted to squeal on then made it look like he didn't. his thirst for attention and praise knows no boundaries,261
PikachuBets,"b4  someone's triggered by my saying he's clueless (""but he's winning!"") let me point out that this is a guy who is ""very hesitant"" to bet cbb until february but he thinks he can be convinced that maybe there is value in dec/jan. what a fucking joke",249
PikachuBets,". okay. what's to explain? that you just erroneously had my plays in copy/paste and sent it by accident as nba? how come there wasn't a follow-up ""sorry that's not nba""? how come you also sent out dijon -6  yesterday? what coincidence! reply publicly not privately btw",268
PikachuBets,don't ask me ask all these european leagues why they only like to play on the weekends. you'd think they'd want to play on weekdays to avoid competing with the overwhelmingly more popular soccer games but no.....let's stack every weekend all the time even at season end,269

PikachuBets,whats important to me mr. square bettor is that touts do not obfuscate the supposed transparency theyre operating with to take advantage of clueless guys like you who only think in terms of winners locks and free picks. but of course you do not understand this.,261
PikachuBets,of course transparency fucking helps people's bankrollsyou simpleton. if i am transparent about losing this season with unimpressive clv then people can use that info to decide whether to play my plays or not. if i am transparent that my results aren't great that is valuable.,276

PikachuBets,the economics of this generation are so grossly different from that of previous generations theres simply no comparison. so when these fuckers call us entitled and lazy or w/e its a load of fucking bullshit. things like wow i paid myself thru college doesnt work anymore,270
PikachuBets,hey of course this has to do with original tweet! acknowledging decline of cbb is multifactorial is better than saying no nba players is why college ball sucks which was what your tweet said! i just wanted you to admit its not that simple or straightforward,257
PikachuBets,as fans we honestly dont have the right to complain about awfulwhen these players were doing college ball and going hungry at night bc dining halls were closed after practice and teams couldnt buy them food. ofc they want the paycheck. unpaid college life is tough,264
