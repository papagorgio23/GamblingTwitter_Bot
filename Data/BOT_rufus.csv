RufusPeabody,i ran 3 2 0 0 0 0  byron nelson sims. not only did romo not win in a single one of them he also never cracked the top 1 5 . i give him a 1 .7  %  chance of making the cut and that's after cranking up his projected variance to levels i've never used.,249
RufusPeabody,you and a group of friends draft foods. pick a time period. i say 1  month. you can only eat foods you draft for that time. i think it‚Äôs a brilliant idea. there‚Äôs no mock drafts to look at. no one knows that the adp of bacon should be. but i guarantee you learn from the draft.,277
RufusPeabody,you can keep it as 3  but you just need a much bigger sample. include extra innings. and as far as bad beats go i was on rangers too but didn't find it to be a particularly egregious beat. every year i seem to lose one 6 -run 9 th inning lead. now that's a bad beat.,266
RufusPeabody,if we assume probability of converting 2 -pt try is 4 8  %  ordinarily you're better off waiting until after the third td if and only if your probability of converting on that last try is 6 4  % . don't think waiting magically increases 2 -pt chance from 4 8  %  to 6 4  % .,274
RufusPeabody,i'm going to go on the record and say i don't think  5 9 .3 6  %  record from 1 2 /8 -2 /1 3  is legit. i think multiple models were tested and they sent the best-performing one to cohnreznick after the fact. i could be wrong but would need evidence to change my mind.,268
RufusPeabody,. regarding your claim that 5 9 .3 6  %  is fact can you back that up? can you verify that you sent model numbers to  each day from 1 2 /8 /2 0 1 8  to 2 /1 2 /2 0 1 9 ? the report does not say this. can you please provide evidence.,232
RufusPeabody,i agree with this. how someone deals with adversity is critical. my first full year betting baseball my partners and i made  $ 9 0 0 0 0 0  before the all-star break and then gave  $ 7 0 0 0 0 0  back. motivated me to work harder. i did not want that feeling again.,265
RufusPeabody,the idea that there are people so bad at betting that fading them ‚Äî betting the opposite of what they‚Äôre on ‚Äî provides value is preposterous. yes the avg bettor is worse than a coin flipper (i‚Äôd guess like 4 9 .7  % ) bc of biases that they fall victim to but not by much.,272
RufusPeabody,just because you can beat a market doesn't mean your price is more accurate than the market's. it just means it adds *something* to the market price. if the true price for something is -1 5 0  the market has -1 4 5  and your model has -1 8 0  the market is the better price,273
RufusPeabody,consensus among panelists is us sports betting will have a handle of  $ 1 5 0 - $ 2 5 0  billion in the next 1 0  years. though yass is hopeful if trading costs go down (we‚Äôd need an exchange model here) we could see a trillion dollars. i for one am rooting for that.,267
RufusPeabody,question: you mentioned some people not betting the recommended amt. are you including bettors who weren't able to bet the  $ 3 0 0  per pick because limits for first half cbb totals are  $ 2 5 0  at betcris the book whose prices you use. that is the market you all actually did well in.,287
RufusPeabody,ten years ago i met a pro bettor outside a sportsbook and struck up a conversation. two months later he and his partners were betting my baseball. a month after that i quit my job at lvsc and went to work full-time for a syndicate. it was the best decision i made in my life.,275
RufusPeabody,this tout releases a number of picks. on some the line moves in their favor (i.e. from +7  to +6 .5 ). this could be bc they have many subs betting a good reputation or sharps are considering their opinion but the point is there is not market resistance to these picks. (2 /6 ),277
RufusPeabody,this is why the tout industry has the reputation it does. picks are down 7 + units since you started selling but let's focus on the  %  of packages that are profitable. this is just like vegas dave saying he's 5 0 -2  but not mentioning that a loss is 3 0  units. be better,273
RufusPeabody,"scenario 4 : georgia loses one more game in the regular season and does not make the sec championship game. honestly i don't even know where the 0 .3  %  comes from here. there would need to be more carnage than i can fathom.

RufusPeabody,here's our cfb playoff probabilities. florida auburn and lsu's remaining sos rank 1 5 7 . clemson on the other hand has the 6 8 th-toughest remaining schedule and is 8 6  %  to win acc title. given easy schedule and how top-heavy the field is clemson likely needs to win out to get in,284
RufusPeabody,"1 . i thought he did have a public history (albeit not that long) of winning. because of that history people shared accounts with him correct? hell because of that history a big group wanted to bet his stuff for big money.
2 . i don't know. i don't have details on how he did.",276
RufusPeabody,ok so 8 0  plays and 5 6  %  is ~ 6 .1  units per season of profit. off topic but what do you expect moving forward? market much more efficient now. publicly released  picks have averaged 5 4 .5  %  over 8  seasons w/ 8 5  picks/year but lost 2  of last 3  years.,263

RufusPeabody,haha and now they moved mcilroy/koepka to -1 5 0 /+1 1 5 . it was -1 3 2 /+1 1 7  for the last 1 2  hours so guess that was a mistake. they also had dj -1 8 6 /tiger +1 4 0  which is less juice on both sides than the mcilroy/tiger.,231
RufusPeabody,there‚Äôs also a team building aspect to it. you don‚Äôt want all carbs or veggies. if you draft peanut butter but don‚Äôt get jelly that‚Äôs an awful pick. team chemistry matters. it won‚Äôt be the easiest month to eat out but people voluntarily do things like the 6 /1 2 /1 8 /2 4  challenge.,284
RufusPeabody,so you give out a pick against a number (9 ) that might exist in the future and if it does then you're picking against that number? but if the line were to drop to 8  you'd get to keep the pick against 8 .5 ? and you don't see the issue with this? üßê,249

RufusPeabody,my experience with the  app was another story. i deposited 2 0  thousand  hoping i'd be able to bet most of it. i quickly found the limits made that impossible and only bet through 7  thousand . learned the hard way that unlike in vegas i can't just get the remaining 1 3  thousand  back.,288
RufusPeabody,stepping back for a second what's the real issue with jambos? it's a bad look for the sb industry that a company can raise  $ 2 3  mill have no real product and a ceo who spits out trumpian nonsense. will end up hurting companies with real innovative ideas when they try to raise  $ ,283

RufusPeabody,with alabama we really don't know how the committee will treat tua's injury. a convincing win over auburn would go a long way but that would be auburn's 4 th loss which could diminish the value of the win to the committee. a win by alabama would give them a 4 6  %  chance.,273
RufusPeabody,"oddly enough we think georgia has an outside shot to make the playoff even if they lose the sec title gm. 

if alabama loses to auburn oklahoma loses to okla st (but beats baylor in b1 2  champ) and oregon wins pac-1 2  georgia has to be the favorite to hold the  spot right?",275

RufusPeabody,the best prediction is some combination of the market and your prediction if you‚Äôre ‚Äúbeating the market‚Äù. it could be 8 0  %  weight on market price and 2 0  %  on your model price. you‚Äôre beating the market but your price isn‚Äôt better than the market price; it just adds something to it,287
RufusPeabody,my point was that right now in the us there is balance-able action not being taken. what's the right way to take it? an exchange? maybe. it's a small slice of the pie but it is still a slice and if every operator is going for the same big slice there's an opportunity there,273
RufusPeabody,even if those were placed at 9 :4 5 am that means they'd be jumping from  $ 2 0 0  to  $ 1 0 0 0 0  limits. which makes me think the 1 0  thousand  thing is a promo they used for good pr and not something they are planning on sticking with.,240
RufusPeabody,i was most pleased with the limits at william hill and draftkings (though william hill is now the worst after cutting my limits to  $ 5 0 ). hard rock came in after that followed by fanduel and lastly pointsbet. betstarts is an na as i never got it funded. ditto w/ mgm  czr.,275
RufusPeabody,f*ck statistical significance. it's an awful concept that makes people a slave to p-values. i'm taking a bayesian approach and my prior is pretty strong. also if i flip a coin 1 8  times and get 3  heads and 1 5  tails would i believe there's a reason i should bet tails going fwd?,281
RufusPeabody,my concern with the policy is that it has a predatory effect. i‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the intention but my opinion is that is the effect. people are forced in some cases to bet more just to get their money back. this does not sit well with me. it‚Äôs a common offshore book ploy.,275
RufusPeabody,"when you say your +7 9  units is the best you've seen who are you comparing it to? how many services followed your criteria?

RufusPeabody,another big question is at  a majority of our models in the ensemble give lsu a very slight edge over ohio state but the ones that don't make ohio state a very clear  ohio state doesn't have the same marquee wins as lsu but has blown everyone out. could go either way here,272

RufusPeabody,...for his company. and i think that‚Äôs kind of what this tout service has been able to do in a way also because let‚Äôs face it -- their leader is a smooth-talking salesman and he‚Äôs very good at that.‚Äù this was neither meant as a comparison of   mcfarland as people (2 /3 ),271

RufusPeabody,and using only games with a 3 .5 -4  point spread is not the best way to estimate the true rate a 3 .5 -4  point favorite will have score diff of exactly 3  2  1  0  -1  -2  or -3 . want to expand the sample and use a little statistical inference.,247

RufusPeabody,will do a full recap of my attempt to bet some nfl futures in new jersey. it's my first time betting in nj (not counting the dk contest). biggest frustration so far is the apps freezing all the freaking time. and i've been surprised (in both good and bad ways) with the limits.,277
RufusPeabody,i've gotten shit for making absolute statements before. not every tout goes about it this way. i much more respect a tout that has been losing but doesn't falsify their record. there are one or two that have won long-term but you're not going to get me to shill for a tout ever.,278
RufusPeabody,the results were not what i had hoped for but not a disaster. normally after the super bowl (win or lose) i feel letdown plus a sense of dread of having to prep for baseball but this year feels different. i've realized i don't have to bet baseball if i don't want to.,267
RufusPeabody,but oklahoma has more of a chance to improve their standing with oklahoma state and baylor left. if oklahoma wins out we give them a 2 6  %  chance. after three straight 1 -score wins ou badly needs some style points. both ou and utah will be rooting hard for bama/uga losses.,276
RufusPeabody,oklahoma and utah stand to have remarkably similar profiles if both win out. using opp win %  and opp opp win  %  after conf title gms ou w/ sos of 5 4  utah 5 8 . utah  ou  using in-season only  model. surplus wins and strength of record almost identical right now,265
RufusPeabody,my simulations showed that using full kelly is optimal even if your edge isn‚Äôt known with absolute certainty but its distribution is. basically as long as there‚Äôs no bias ‚Äî instances where your expected edge has a mean of 5  %  actually average to 5  %  edge ‚Äî you‚Äôre ok using kelly.,283
RufusPeabody,this also is illustrative of the power of the reverse jinx. for a reverse jinx to have any power it has to be done with pure intentions. you can't try to reverse jinx something. doesn't work that way. bet has to be graded early because you think it's a loser for sure.,268
RufusPeabody,seth i ran a gazillion sims sampling from a range of diff offered odds w/ expected edges uniformly dist'd from 1 -1 5  % . in one set edges were known. in another they were mean of a distribution which i sampled from. with fully kelly there is really no difference long-term.,275

RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm guessing a very very small fraction. the problem is that there is a cost to these people. with fanduel you can only deposit cash at their bm book at the meadowlands. to avoid having to make additional trips it would make sense to deposit the max you think you‚Äôll need.,272
RufusPeabody,right which is why i don't expect the average bettor to hit 5 0  % ; it's going to be in the neighborhood of 4 9 .5  %  against wa ats markets. you could get me to believe it's 4 9  %  but not lower than 4 7 .6  % .,215

RufusPeabody,what tout wants to give free access to their picks in real time? how do they know monitor won't use the info for themselves? hopefully someone smarter than me knows a way to verify the timestamp of selection and also not allow anyone access to the plays until after games start.,278
RufusPeabody,sorry if i'm being too general for your taste. can understand why you take issue with it. but exceptions in this industry are few  far between and bettors make the mistake of paying for -ev picks from a losing tout faaaar more often than passing on a pick-seller who has value.,277
RufusPeabody,did i say anything negative about ras? have i ever? they're a clear exception in how they operate. and they understand how hard it is for people to get down on winning picks at the release price so they jump through a lot of hoops to try to make it work.,254
RufusPeabody,i know i have focused on the negative too much on here. i need to do a better job of highlighting the positives.  is incredible! their hold on multiway markets is far and away the best in the industry. 1 0  thousand  limits on props. and (unfortunately) some real sharp lines.,276
RufusPeabody,i think schwimer is an incredibly smart guy. but he thinks he is 1 0 0  times  smarter. and he thinks he is able to see things that others can't. he jumps from one business idea to another with regularity. imo that does not translate to running a sustainably successful business.,279
RufusPeabody,i'm not any sort of expert on this but it does seem like if you were working in concert with someone else and could create 3 0 0  unique lineups (instead of 1 5 0 ) in a contest with a small slate (4  games) that would be an unfair advantage.,242
RufusPeabody,and we already covered this. the way their tech works is they limit someone to a  %  of the market for all markets. which is why betting a lot of small market stuff and props can really hurt if you are actually trying to hit the big markets for limits,251
RufusPeabody,good point about the tj. he's also not cheap anymore. projected arb salary of  $ 5 .7  mill (per  this year and probably closer to  $ 1 0  mill next year. won't be part of a contending o's team regardless. question is would value increase if they dealt him midseason.,267

RufusPeabody,why does clv matter? the price discovery process. it indicates that other people who influence the market are on the same side. it matters bc no model (or intuition) is perfect. the best bettors are humble enough to know that their opinion isn't the only one that can have value.,279

RufusPeabody,let's take a look at georgia's cfb playoff chances (thread): the rest of their schedule is not easy -- florida auburn missouri and am remain and if they navigate those the sec title game vs. alabama or lsu. here are the various scenarios and their playoff hopes in each(1 /x),275
RufusPeabody,it results in jambos being able to recommend bets with lower edges in order to get more exposure on a position. a subscriber would have been better off doubling up on vikings -9  than teasing. since jambos is allowing themselves to recommend the same game in different ways (4 /x),280
RufusPeabody,if  picks move lines they would not be ‚Äúthe global market mover‚Äù; they would be one of many that can influence markets. it may be a  $ 5 0 0 b but any sharp bettor can tell you that sports betting is hard to scale. still no answer to that.,239
RufusPeabody,trying to understand where he lied. i may not know the whole story so correct me if i'm wrong: bh posted picks on twitter last season and was successful. a group hired him to bet his baseball. then the whole gchdafjadf thing. but i'm not sure where the lie was.,261
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm not asking you to change an industry. i‚Äôm asking you to display actual records rather than cherry picked *hot streaks* you get by dividing your plays up into all these different categories so when you filter by play type unit and day of the week something is always hot.,274
RufusPeabody,i know i'm a broken record on the tout thing. i know touts won't go away. my hope is that the needle moves in the right direction for consumers. that transparency will beget more transparency and become an expectation.and that scammers will stand out like a sore thumb to everyone,280
RufusPeabody,thread üëá. while the action network app is great for tracking your own bets it allows for past posting changing lines/units etc. so you should not use it to evaluate a handicapper. (same goes for twitter ‚Äî can delete tweets with losing picks and block ppl who call them out),273
RufusPeabody,. final jeopardy wager of  $ 1 3 9 9  was the right move. if emma (leader) is 5 0  %  to answer correctly she wants to wager enough to cover james doubling up. james's wager size ensured he would win if emma answered incorrectly based on his (correct) expectation.,264

RufusPeabody,when i was a kid no one complained about food poisoning when they got sick to their stomach. as an adult at least among my cohorts if someone is sick they always blame it on something they ate. no buddy you drank too much. or maybe you just got sick.,250
RufusPeabody,why do i take issue with most touts? this guy is down 6 6  units for the year (tracked by an independent third party) yet the site he sells on (surprise! pregame) is touting how he‚Äôs on a heater. ü§® someone help me understand how this is honest and ethical.,256
RufusPeabody,"good work nelson! a few questions: (1 ) are you using the whole field or excluding pga pros? (2 ) what  %  of the effect would you say is a ""true effect"" vs. random variation (i.e. if you randomly select 5 0  %  of the golfers you'd find *some* over/underperformance)",267
RufusPeabody,why is everything about proving yourself and hiding records??? me and other people in this thread are bettors. we bet for a living. we don't sell picks. we don't have to prove anything to anyone. and we can raise points about the company that fired you if we want to.,267
RufusPeabody,here's my point -- if a pick-seller who is essentially flipping coins is able to convince someone to buy their picks should that be celebrated? there are a helluva lot of tricks that aren't illegal that can be used to make their record seem a lot better. is that ethical?,271
RufusPeabody,thread: don't know if this idea is possible but here goes -- a tout monitor site where pick-sellers who want to be seen as legit agree to somehow send plays to the monitor in realtime (or some other way of the site being able to verify the timestamp of release),261
RufusPeabody,...in the former case it'll be very hard for the average customer to get the release price. you'll also probably be approached by syndicates who will offer you more money than you can make selling to work just with them. either way i don't see it as a sustainable thing.,270
RufusPeabody,where to begin? records posted vs lines at books that weren‚Äôt open ‚Äî this was a recurring issue. not understanding that totals are no action if listed pitchers don‚Äôt start. not understanding what listing pitchers even means.  $ 3 0 0  bets vs markets with  $ 2 5 0  limits...,275
RufusPeabody,"i love playing the game of ""cherry pick the good picks and forget about the crappy ones"". it's a great game touts love to play.

as to the limits cris has  $ 2 5 0  limits on 1 h cbb totals. you release at cris lines. need i say more?",234
RufusPeabody,people seem to be taking this at face value. the line move info is actually publicly available. schwimer promised to release the line move report but never has. why not? makes you wonder... my hunch? this is just pr on his part to save face. willing to be proven wrong.,269
RufusPeabody,to be fair when he tried to hire me and i pointed out the flaws in the tout model he said i only knew 5  %  of the plan. he couldn't tell me the other 9 5  %  but if he had it would have blown my mind i'm sure.,210
RufusPeabody,i get that cappercon is a business. fine. but i disagree that the presence of a bettor advocacy nonprofit would upset an operator (like hard rock) sponsoring the event. abc wants the same thing as most operators -- to see sports betting in the u.s. succeed in a sustainable way.,278

RufusPeabody,discussing teasing across zero  said  had an edge on lac -3  -1 1 9  but not enough of an edge to recommend a pick. they had a huge edge on the vikings though so the two teased 6 .5  points was a big enough edge to play. (1 /x),227

RufusPeabody,giving out picks is the thing i least like to do in this space. i hate the tout space (including the free tout space). it started as a way to show that our rating system actually had value but now it's become a chore and one i don't like.,238
RufusPeabody,"i‚Äôm not much better! i am a sports fan but most of what i talk about will be boring numbers.

RufusPeabody,personally my answer is no. you don't know if the picks were against stale lines if the person provided all their accounts to the auditor etc. an auditor can't audit what they don't know exists. whether you're charging or not i personally think you need to use public record,274
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôve just never thought in terms of units since i‚Äôm not trying to communicate my record to the masses. in general i am betting whatever i can get down on all but big market stuff where i‚Äôll cap things around a certain amount bc i don‚Äôt want ginormous swings,257

RufusPeabody,check roulette. very different. you gamble on the sum of the digits of the bottom line of the check. everyone takes numbers 0 -9 . for example  $ 1 2 9 .1 8  would be ‚Äú2 1 ‚Äù so whoever had the ‚Äú1 ‚Äù would pay the whole bill.,223
RufusPeabody,you didn‚Äôt release picks vs best available; claiming record vs that is disingenuous and i‚Äôm v suspicious of the accuracy of the data. furthermore you said clients weren‚Äôt able to get down at your release price so how would they get a better price?! this is ridiculous mike mike,277
RufusPeabody,would love feedback from those of you interested in this! for this to work we'll need a lot of people to donate their time. do you have technical expertise (i.e. helping build a website) you could volunteer? is there anything i missed? what do you think is important?,267

RufusPeabody,there are a number of reasons but i‚Äôll summarize as ‚Äútalent still matters‚Äù. 1 2  games is still not *that* much football so all else equal i‚Äôll take the team with players who were considered more talented going into the season over the one with less talented players.,267

RufusPeabody,bob: how much have the pats overperformed your expectation (based on your math models) coming off a loss? and i'm sure you could look at a more granular level in terms of over-performance in ypp play success epa... if it's something fundamental to pats why not model it?,270
RufusPeabody,if your data has any errors you don't address -- and with all the new complex data available errors can be prevalant  well hidden -- a black box machine learning-based model can go off the rails. a logical inference-based model is much better able to withstand data issues.,273
RufusPeabody,makes it seem really easy to win betting parlay. bad bankroll management. etc. it's like stories on lottery winners in a way except it's less obvious to people that this is luck. i wish there would be more stories on guys losing big bets. don't encourage problem gambling!,272
RufusPeabody,i do share some picks (in big market sports where i'm less likely to cannibalize my edge). but i make my living betting. if i gave away everything i'd have no edge left. not sure how that makes me a fraud. i'm not selling anything to anyone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,243
RufusPeabody,it's the picks that get favorable line movement that are responsible for the positive return but those plays are +ev at the release price (unavailable to you now) not the price after the market reacts. and the subset of picks that doesn't move is almost certainly negative ev.,276
RufusPeabody,"there are sharp bettors on the other side who disagree with the play. 

when the tout releases the picks you didn't know which subset will be profitable at the release price and which wouldn't but after the market reacts you have new information to consider. (5 /6 )",266
RufusPeabody,furthermore it makes it difficult to evaluate a tout's predictions. do their picks actually do better with bigger edges? and to gauge that properly (since there can be noise in small samples) you need to know their purported edges on games they didn't release plays on as well.,277
RufusPeabody,because in my example the expected value of a pat and 2 -pt conversion attempt are the same. the reason this works out the way it does at the end of the game is because there's no difference between losing by 1  or by 2  to a team.,231
RufusPeabody,that's a reasonable argument. but the committee does give weight to winning a conference title. i think it comes down to whether you think the sec will get a 1 -loss team that doesn't win the sec (that's not alabama) in over a 1 -loss power 5  champ.,250
RufusPeabody,on the pod yesterday i said the following: ‚Äúi was watching the fyre documentary on the plane and...that guy billy mcfarland when he had that company magnesis was able to get these new york papers and organizations to write articles that were basically press releases... (1 /3 ),277
RufusPeabody,that study is just a database query from 6  years of nfl games. how often 3 .5 -4  point favorites actually cover +2  to +2 .5  (what warren quotes) isn't that relevant. more important is how often the team fails to cover the spread but covers the teaser.,255
RufusPeabody,that's not exactly true. first off it's 2 7  for 1  which is 2 6 /1 . second that's before commission on the winning wager which varies depending on what country you're in but let's say 5  %  so now we're down to 2 4 .7 /1 .,224
RufusPeabody,of course there are. but also know that my dms are flooded with messages from touts and guess what? they all claim to be the 1  %  that are an exception to the rule. for your average bettor trying to find those true exceptions is a fool‚Äôs errand.,246
RufusPeabody,i don‚Äôt know if that was the bet but i‚Äôm gonna call bullshit on that. that was priced as a matchup between mcilroy and mcdowell with a hold of over 5  % . lowry wasn‚Äôt included in the mu at all so don‚Äôt know how that makes sense.,229
RufusPeabody,congrats james on one helluva run! you may not have the  record but i'd make you a sizable favorite over  you made us pro bettors seem smart by association. on top of that you handled yourself with class  were graceful in defeat. üëèüëè now when's the strip club?,259
RufusPeabody,"if you're listing pitchers which any bettor with a pulse should be doing a starting pitching change makes a bet ""no action"". if you're not listing pitchers then you're at the mercy of the book and get action at the first price they hang after the pitching change.",263
RufusPeabody,it‚Äôs simple: counting cards even as a team the way the mit team did it is not illegal. it‚Äôs just not. casinos are private property and can tell people they are no longer welcome to play. but it‚Äôs not illegal unless you‚Äôre using electronics or something to aid,259
RufusPeabody,i guess my point is just that my financial interest in the industry has always been that i'm a bettor. insofar as prices are rarely dictated by square action touts don't make the betting markets any more inefficient. so i don't think touts are affecting my bottom line.,269
RufusPeabody,the twitter tout who's had a good first three weeks doesn't disclose the 1 4  other twitter accounts where he gives out different picks. he markets the one that got hot! consumers are at a huge information disadvantage when buying picks. be cognizant of what you don't know!,274
RufusPeabody,koepka feels like the tiger of old. when he's got a lead and playing well it just feels like it's over. (note this is how it feels to me. it is not intended to be any sort of predictive analysis and i'm certainly not betting based on it.),238

RufusPeabody,if a tout's picks lose long-term they're still paid. even if they refund subscription fees they're free rolling  the customer loses. if a customer can't get down at the release price it doesn't directly hurt the tout. the seller's record is based on the price they sent out.,274
RufusPeabody,if the process of prepping for and betting baseball feels like an obligation i'm not going to do it (despite the fact that it's an even-numbered year). i have so many other things in my life i'm juggling with the podcast nonprofit golf  another project in the works.,266

RufusPeabody,added game ncaab totals have  $ 2 5 0  limits. not hard to move those. i don‚Äôt know if they are or aren‚Äôt moving lines. i just know mike thought somehow they could give out picks that had value without influencing prices which doesn‚Äôt make logical sense,253

RufusPeabody,when i use yards/play my ypp number adjusts for field position down dist as well as game situation -- a team down 3  scores in the 4 th quarter has a different baseline than one up 3  scores. it also de-weights garbage time. contextualization is so important.,259

RufusPeabody,seems like an ideal application of blockchain technology so that records can't be altered. picks need to be submitted against a widely available line (which is how it should be because a tout's core competency should not be pointing out that the bovada public line is off).,273

RufusPeabody,no the trick is to sign the player. they aren't competing with anyone. if you mark it up enough you can do it with almost no model at all. not saying their player eval is good or bad just saying that's not what makes bla successful.,232
RufusPeabody,this is a broader point regarding pick-sellers in general and transparency. you're only buying a slice of information -- team x is a bet at price y. without more information you have no way of knowing whether to play team x at a slightly worse price.,250

RufusPeabody,this was my favorite orioles season in awhile. they sucked but there's a process in place and hope for the future. and for some reason i liked the players on the team more than i did during the winning years. gestures like this certainly don't hurt.,249
RufusPeabody,jambos uses a 1  play = 1  unit system. units can be easily manipulated by a tout to show a winning record whether it's unit inflation if they're down or an old fashioned martingale system. if 1  play = 1  unit that's not possible. (2 /x),238

RufusPeabody,3 ) when there were pitching changes picks were still graded as if bets stood. 4 ) grading suspended games using non industry standard practices when it benefited them. i gave michael my opinion on these things and some of the changes i suggested were implemented.,264

RufusPeabody,came across this 1 2 ‚Äìyear old email i wrote asking  for a job. i ended up taking a job that paid 2 5  thousand  a year because i loved it. had no idea where it would take me but definitely wouldn‚Äôt have predicted this path.,224
RufusPeabody,good point. that's why it needs to be for the life of someone's subscription. if people have different starting dates and can cancel anytime that incentive isn't as strong. plus could have a commitment to only having plays be between 1  and 3  units or something.,263
RufusPeabody,hypothetical: if a bettor decided to publicly release picks for free to everyone would it be ok for them to include their betting history prior to publicly releasing picks in their official record (provided it was independently audited by a top 1 0  accounting firm)? discuss.,276
RufusPeabody,why do i not tweet pictures of winning betting tickets? not only is it deceiving (without seeing the losing tickets you know nothing of my roi) but it also gives touts the opportunity to claim those tickets as their own and use them for marketing purposes.,256
RufusPeabody,a friend of mine (not  tried to bet a us open tournament matchup at  they took  $ 2 6 .6 0 . they may promise to take  $ 1 0  thousand  on game days in big markets but they certainly don't take bets on anything else!,216
RufusPeabody,"has always been something that's varied from book to book. believe it or not this is an area where the offshores have traditionally been better than the us books. important to read the fine print. does it say ""must start for action""? if not you're sol.",252
RufusPeabody,i want to talk about fanduel‚Äôs policy of requiring 5 0  %  rollover before withdrawing deposited funds. i was told it‚Äôs aimed at combatting money laundering which is a noble goal but i think it‚Äôs negative effects outweigh the positive (at least in my opinion) (thread),268
RufusPeabody,"if you add ""verified by a neutral third-party"" then yes. (oh and also verify that they don't have other sites selling picks.) yeah there's still survivorship bias and all. but if it could set a better standard for the tout industry i could live with it.",253
RufusPeabody,of course there are bettors that hit 4 5  % ! that doesn't mean their underlying (lack of) skill is 4 5  % . it is not. they are the tail of the distribution and got unlucky. their expectation was within the margin of the vig.,226
RufusPeabody,to be clear i don't think  wanted my bank statements for any nefarious purpose. i think they have a company policy to some due diligence if you are looking to increase your deposit limits. makes sense to try to make sure you're not a problem gambler.,250
RufusPeabody,"frazar 2 0 1 1  st jude: 9 9 9 /1

my methodology has improved a lot since that time though so who knows what i would've made frazar using the same methodology i'm using now.",207
RufusPeabody,i applaud you for the transparency. however i was talking about a monitor that does not take ads and does not require you to trust that a third party doesn't have a conflict of interest. something on the blockchain would make it impossible to fudge records.,257
RufusPeabody,so because someone is able to market a hot streak on friday 3  star plays and people are gullible enough to buy it that's free market? the problem is a lack of awareness. are used car salesmen selling lemons are also taking advantage of free enterprise?,253
RufusPeabody,the fact that an industry exists where the vast majority of proprietors provide no value yet are still paid for their services irks me. there's no accountability. i'm not saying things like this are unique to sports betting but that doesn't make it any better imo.,264
RufusPeabody,"to be clear if you have an edge on each leg of the parlay then this is not true. 

but you‚Äôre typically paying a premium taking big faves on the ml. 

the squarest bettors love parlaying favorites on the ml. books know this and protect themselves.",247
RufusPeabody,fyi i asked a friend (former sub) if they got the survey. they checked their email  found it. ofc they hadn't filled it out. if y'all are interested here's what it looks like. v long. no idea how he's defining any of the stats he quotes.,237
RufusPeabody,same issue with dk's sports betting national championship a year ago. some people had groups of entries which put ppl with a single entry at a disadvantage. how does this get addressed in the dfs/contest world going forward? i honestly don't know. so tough to enforce.,268
RufusPeabody,"no tvs with game on within a 3  min walk of my gate and flight keeps getting delayed a half hour at a time. i‚Äôve now gone to the bar and closed out two different times. and now heading back.

RufusPeabody,there are lots of bettors out there that care about this  have a lot of industry knowledge but most don't have the time or patience to read through all these bills. we won't see changes unless legislators understand our perspective and what matters to bettors.,260
RufusPeabody,"teams with the most ""hidden yards"" (hidden by context) on offense in wk1 5 : ny giants chiefs cardinals vikings and seahawks. bringing up the rear are the jets panthers dolphins chargers  bears who don't look as bad in the box score as they should.",248
RufusPeabody,"this thread will go through some of the  scenarios using results from  simulations and our model predicting the committee's behavior: 

(1 ) favorites all win. 

likelihood: 3 3  % 

osu/lsu/clemson 1 0 0  % 
oklahoma 6 0  % 
utah 3 9  % 
georgia 1  % ",252
RufusPeabody,thanks adam! you‚Äôre having far more success with your committee model than us this year. we‚Äôre mostly using our own metrics as a proxy for ‚Äúbest‚Äù and ‚Äúmost deserving‚Äù which did surprisingly well last year. using that they *actually* use makes so much more sense.,262
RufusPeabody,apparently i wasn‚Äôt clear on this. i declined an offer of employment from big league advance. i spent some time with their team last fall trying to see if it was a good fit. i received  $ 0  in compensation for any guidance i provided.,235
RufusPeabody,this is not a model for predicting how good the teams are; this is a model that predicts how the cfb playoff committee ranks the teams. it doesn't make much sense doing it after 5  weeks but i was curious what it would look like.,229
RufusPeabody,they could bet 1 0 + units on a game by mixing in alternate point spreads money lines 1 st half bets 1 st quarter bets teasers and parlays. this goes completely against the spirit of the 1  play = 1  unit system. (5 /x),219
RufusPeabody,what is the english translation of the letter √¶? would it be a e or ae? haven't needed it yet but after dealing with enough √∏ √© √≠ and √± thought it was time to make a more complete unicode dictionary in my golf code.,215
RufusPeabody,this is a bigger issue in the smaller markets they‚Äôre in (i.e. cbb 1 h totals for small schools). if they are not getting closing line value there is no reason to think they will win. if the picks are good they will move markets.,229
RufusPeabody,that said i still do not believe in the business model for reasons many other people have pointed out. 1 ) the ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù is not guaranteed ‚Äî you are trusting that the company will have funds available to pay everyone in the event of losses.,242
RufusPeabody,the problem is every year i have to go back through my code and figure out what the hell i was doing and then try to get to the ideas i had for improvements the previous season. it's like re-learning a language every goddamn year.,230
RufusPeabody,the tout industry will always be a scourge on the betting ecosystem. but i would like to try to move the needle towards more transparency. if more touts essentially bet on themselves winning i'd hope it would increase pressure on other's to do the same.,253
RufusPeabody,please remember: if you buy a pick from a tout if the tout has a 5 5  %  win rate (which would be extraordinary!) betting at -1 1 0  you need to bet 2 0  times the price of the pick just to break even.,201
RufusPeabody,these books all have promos. how is that what differentiates them? the 1 0  thousand  on game day for the two biggest american markets is standard. is any book really afraid of a sharp betting 1 0  thousand  on nfl sides on a sunday morning?,241
RufusPeabody,i'd like to point out that it was incredibly annoying when i limit bet something and was not able to re-bet since they didn't move the line. had this experience at fanduel trying to re-bet golf. move the line (or don't) and take another bet!,241
RufusPeabody,was not a fan of the  app. and they only had 1 6  nfl rsw totals listed. and just the last 1 6  teams in alphabetical order. wtf. (i wanted to bet teams earlier in alphabetical orders so didn't even try to put anything in.),223
RufusPeabody,you also don‚Äôt know how much you‚Äôre going to bet beforehand especially if you‚Äôre limited betting or live betting. in the absence of this policy you‚Äôd expect people to deposit more. so this policy basically provides a negative consequence for erring high on deposit amount.,272
RufusPeabody,of course they are. but markets aren't that inefficient that exhibiting these biases will make you a 4 5  %  bettor. think about how many people would just understand the biases and magically be winning bettors if that were the case. it's not that easy.,253
RufusPeabody,let‚Äôs say you and i both bet  $ 1 1 0  on opposite sides of a game. bookie pays off the winning bet ( $ 1 0 0 ) with the  $ 1 1 0  from the losing bet and makes  $ 1 0  profit.,176
RufusPeabody,i have had a great day because i haven‚Äôt even looked at an odds screen or twitter (until now) all day and actually wrote some pretty awesome code that will make future me happy üòÉ. plus i got to talk to the legendary ted knutson,227
RufusPeabody,and posting winning tickets (even if they are legitimate) tells you nothing because you never see the losing ones. i could have posted hundreds of winning prop tickets from the 2 0 1 8  super bowl when i actually lost 6  figures on the game!,241
RufusPeabody,psa: just because someone posts a winning betting ticket does not mean it‚Äôs their own. some of these touts try to pass off other people‚Äôs legit winning tickets as their own. and everyone please stay away from this  guy. i‚Äôm reporting copyright infringement to twitter,267
RufusPeabody,the issue of incentives is fundamental to how i see the world. everyone i've worked with in the betting world has gotten paid as a percentage of revenue. incentives aligned. my big problem with pick-selling is the misalignment of incentives between the seller  customer. (thread),279
RufusPeabody,". on me: ""he‚Äôs the definition of a troll to me. has never had a positive word to say about me. hate follows me.""

RufusPeabody,imagine how much more value super bowl (ahem ‚Äúbig game‚Äù) props would have if instead of being played in idyllic weather following a bunch of games played in the cold it were played in typical winter weather following a bunch of games indoors/in warm weather.,258
RufusPeabody,‚ñ∂Ô∏è provide an outlet for bettors who feel they were mistreated (whether illegal or not) by legal books to file reports. create a repository that we can use to better understand issues bettors are having. what books are misbehaving? use this to influence legislation.,265
RufusPeabody,i floated the idea of a consumer-protection-in-sports-betting nonprofit earlier this yr. my lawyer tried to get  to make a donation to fund it (in lieu of a settlement for sbnc) but they declined saying they thought the protections in place were more than adequate.,265
RufusPeabody,you see rob there are many different types of picks. ones you can see ones you can't see ones that got sent to an accounting firm in february ones that had their grading changed afterwards ones that didn't. it's all very simple and transparent.,244
RufusPeabody,if you ask for the report and follow up 5  months later after no response and still don‚Äôt get a response and then have mike‚Äôs cell phone number and text him multiple times then you get the report (which is vague and not signed),227
RufusPeabody,bet the process is up! we talk about trendz fandom coexisting w/ betting as well as the usual (cfb playoff stuff cfb picks nfl futures nfl picks). plus we tease next week's episode (how much are good openers worth to books + machine learning!),243
RufusPeabody,clv should never be the goal (unless you're just chasing steam). it's a leading indicator that you're doing something right based on the assumption that the closing line is the most efficient price. market manipulation can obviously affect that assumption as you pointed out.,275
RufusPeabody,schwim i get what you're saying. i understand wanting to compare amount of money you have to put up. given you're quoting roi based on that it would make sense for  to recommend what  %  of their bankroll they should invest in each play.,237
RufusPeabody,you could argue that a team will save its best plays for the highest leverage situations. if that was the case epa/play would make much more sense predictively. but we know third down performance is no more predictive than 1 st  2 nd down.,239
RufusPeabody,it doesn‚Äôt matter if his picks win or not; if they win it‚Äôs not sustainable and subs won‚Äôt be getting release prices. also i‚Äôm not sure how beating cbb openers or cfb totals on a tuesday would prove they‚Äôre the ‚Äúbest at predicting sports‚Äù,238
RufusPeabody,"if i'm offered 9 9 /1  (1  % ) odds on something i think has 4 9 /1  odds (2  % ) that's a 1  %  ""edge"" according to the way they're defining an edge yet it's expected value is +1 0 0  % ",187

RufusPeabody,no one is claiming you‚Äôre a fool. you‚Äôve done very well for yourself with bla and raising money for this venture. i just don‚Äôt believe you can provide provide value and scale without moving markets. i told you the very same thing last fall.,240
RufusPeabody,from what i saw in a small subset of their picks they were not getting much of any closing line value relative to market price at release (despite a profitable run in cbb at the time). similar issue with lack of clv in baseball.,228

RufusPeabody,the notion that if a tout is moving lines it's not an issue for clients (because lines often move back) is flat-out wrong. the subset of games that don't move or move back will do worse than the ones that steam never to return.,227
RufusPeabody,maybe you're right spraguer. i agree that knowing someone personally makes it more difficult. there are also people in this industry (not in this thread) that i won't publicly criticize because i know who they're connected to and i want to keep both kneecaps.,259
RufusPeabody,thanks for responding johnny. i'm always up for having that long conversation. i'm sure you know how i feel about transparency. hell  nfl picks are in aggregate negative over the past few years but we still have our long-term record displayed when we post.,256
RufusPeabody,haven‚Äôt read the article but i do think there are a lot of people that don‚Äôt bet on sports bc of not wanting/not knowing how to bet with offshores and local bookies. i personally knew nothing about sports betting until my internship with lvsc.,243

RufusPeabody,(thread) is there more randomness in my baseball betting than i would expect from independent events? i.e. is there autocorrelation in my results? are my results on marlins bets all independent events or is there a factor driving the results of all of them.,257
RufusPeabody,i wouldn't say that necessarily since james has been so logical with his approach. but then again she hadn't seen his run. she made the safe defensible play. the psychological cost of losing the way your mom's friend did has to be higher right?,244
RufusPeabody,overall thoughts: the array of offerings is staggering at many of these books most notably draftkings and fanduel. i can bet top continental european in a regular pga event! there are certainly opportunities for sharp bettors. not in a position to comment on longevity.,269

RufusPeabody,ok ok you have a point. and if alabama beats lsu 5 9 -0  1 -loss lsu probably not getting in either. but our model sees it as extremely unlikely that 1 -loss ou gets left out in favor of 1 -loss oregon.,202
RufusPeabody,evaluating redskins/4 9 ers game a tough task for models. you can (should!) control for weather but not all rain games are the same. but it is a great example of how the impact of rain is different on grass than on turf.,220

RufusPeabody,if these are in fact winning bettors the side with more sharp money on it should do better long-term but that doesn't mean there isn't sharp money on both sides. but there are books that will refuse meaningful action that could be matched.,239
RufusPeabody,weather as well as its impact on variance is factored in. if you think 1 2  back has much of a chance despite the conditions i‚Äôm guessing you haven‚Äôt looked at the data. it happens a lot more rarely than you might think.,220
RufusPeabody,i met woodland when i was inside the ropes (thanks espn) during a practice round of the 2 0 1 6  phoenix open. he asked what i made his odds. i told him 4 3 /1 . ‚Äúthat sounds about right‚Äù he replied.,199
RufusPeabody,i wasn't betting into any big markets. since i hadn't bet (outside of a contest) in nj these were virgin accounts. so this is (maybe? somewhat?) representative of what an average person who just signed up would expect to be able to wager.,238
RufusPeabody,for simplicity's sake i was talking about spread market where the baseline is 5 0  % . but the point is the same -- if you faded the big ml picks the juice is large enough that you wouldn't be expected to win.,209
RufusPeabody,also just because a bookie can make more than the vig (and it needs to be substantially more) doesn't mean you can identify those situations before they occur. they are the tail of the distribution and are to be expected due to randomness.,239

RufusPeabody,though to be fair i've seen some really different weather observations for different points around there. point is -- if someplace pretty close to the course had weather that didn't show a *huge* advantage -- it's just so damn hard to forecast!,244
RufusPeabody,your original wager is not included in the odds. to calculate parlay payout multiply the decimal odds together (american odds +1 ). so (8 +1 )*(5 +1 )*(3 +1 ) and subtract one at the end. 2 1 5 /1  is correct.,209

RufusPeabody,why did the titans win? it's simple. the ravens did not convert their high-leverage chances (0 /4  on 4 th down)  turned the ball over three times. their offense didn't stink; they only punted once. turnovers and not converting high leverage situations.,253

RufusPeabody,i've been betting sports for 1 1  years and made enough to comfortably retire using nothing more complex statistically than ordered logistic regressions and multilevel models. more complex != better. it's about processing  contextualizing the data and asking the right questions.,279
RufusPeabody,interesting how qbs can rocket up draft boards based on one good year but nfl teams stick with these same qbs when they struggle because of ‚Äútalent‚Äù and ‚Äúpotential‚Äù (which they believe because of 1 -2  years of starting in college),231
RufusPeabody,in this case though  is circumventing their own rules by using teasers first halfs and moneylines to bet more units on a game. it sets an awful precedent but also makes the incentives of the sub and jambos misaligned. (3 /x),224
RufusPeabody,i was not ‚Äúwatching like a hawk‚Äù. i have not tracked jambos picks. i just pointed out some flaws back in march (you shouldn‚Äôt post a pick using the wynn line at 4 am pt when the wynn book isn‚Äôt open),199
RufusPeabody,haven‚Äôt read it but the argument is never that exchanges are the answer to everything. they just make way too much sense for situations where two people would like to bet opposite sides but can‚Äôt because books won‚Äôt take their action.,234
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm not going to waste my time boosting the profile of a fraud tout. we don‚Äôt have mutual friends. and betting 1 0 0  thousand  with an internet stranger who you know to be a con artist would be incredibly dumb.,211
RufusPeabody,aside from the public nature of it all (involving average joes  overpromising) what makes it different than an originator (i hate that word) getting accounts from people where he gets a percentage (typical betting partner arrangement) and having a losing year?,260
RufusPeabody,i think cville in general. but i will say that the people gill has on his podcast are closer to vegas dave than dr. bob. if you sell picks without providing any meaningful documentation of long-term record you deserve the criticism.,232

RufusPeabody,but do you understand my point? if you're betting with an edge all poor bankroll management will do is increase your variance which of course can make you go busto. but from the book's perspective they will be expected to lose.,227
RufusPeabody,what i‚Äôm saying is there are not people out there worth fading. i‚Äôm sure there are a few ppl hitting 4 5  %  over a large sample of picks but that‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre 4 5  %  fundamentally; it‚Äôs entirely randomness.,217
RufusPeabody,my big pga championship fade... doesn't really exist. probably schauffele by a hair but no huge position against any one golfer. but i do have one golfer i have a much larger position on than anyone. that golfer is tommy fleetwood.,231
RufusPeabody,yes i read that. but think about what a 1 5  %  expected hold entails in terms of price. it's completely unrealistic and shows that the firm that did this (spectrum) does not understand the basics of how sports betting works.,225

RufusPeabody,or lucky. many smarter people than me have shown how much variance there is in a year of dfs. the best player in the world wouldn't announce their winnings. that's what someone who's hoping to sell their services would do.,222

RufusPeabody,in the situation i outlined (team down 1 4  scores a td late in the 4 th quarter) going for two is *still* the optimal choice if you assume a rate of 4 0  % .,158
RufusPeabody,i'm sure it would be a letdown for some teams (and it may be for k state). but for some teams it might not be. unfortunately i don't have access to the kansas state locker room.,177
RufusPeabody,that's a very good point. it's not as simple as looking at the overround with the big mls; book may be concerned with exposure to a big l (could be dog mls or fav ml parlays).,175
RufusPeabody,that's results from one particular sim of the 2 0 0 0 0  sims i run of the rest of the season. so opponent strength is determined by each team's end-of-season mp rating in that sim.,181
RufusPeabody,how bad was michigan last weekend? mp game grades which control for expected opponent strength put them at  of the fbs v fbs games last weekend. they were fundamentally 4 4  points worse than wisconsin (,203
RufusPeabody,i think  is conflating closing line value with value against the closing line. closing line value is difference (or edge depending on how you define it) between closing line implied prob and bet line implied prob.,213
RufusPeabody,i think it‚Äôs possible. you just create an interface for market takers that looks like your typical sportsbook. has price on each side that includes commission as well as ‚Äúlimit‚Äù (volume of offers) for each side.,211
RufusPeabody,understanding how big your true edge is is important. exact kelly staking is not. and if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs quantified your edge well chances are you‚Äôre doing well enough that limits prohibit you from kelly staking.,217
RufusPeabody,arbitrary endpoints makes this meaningless to me. if theory is bigger favorites are more undervalued you can test that effect w/ simple regression. but i wouldn‚Äôt expect either of these trends to be profitable moving forward.,225
RufusPeabody,"your pick was made using the ""vegas insider consensus"" line which is a consensus of vegas books. if you're going to grade using fanduel house rules you need to be basing picks off of fanduel lines.",197
RufusPeabody,honestly that‚Äôs a good question and one i don‚Äôt know the answer to. there is no ‚Äúgrand plan‚Äù at this point (except the non-profit i‚Äôm hoping to launch soon). and obviously i‚Äôm not going to tout.,194
RufusPeabody,their ceo emailed me before they launched. he said the right things. i said i hope it plays out that way. but will hill says the right things; doing the right things is a different story.,187
RufusPeabody,that's the things with the bet  % /money  %  mumbojumbo. there's no actionable info to glean from it without context. which book(s) are used? are they market making books or retail books? and at what price?,206
RufusPeabody,sure you can create a narrative around this random aberration. but that's all it is -- a random aberration. what possible reason would cause persistent underperformance in first games of a series relative to other games?,220
RufusPeabody,the year clarke won it there was a huge weather advantage for one side of the draw. ditto year stenson won. would require a little bit of digging to find but i‚Äôll take a look tomorrow,183
RufusPeabody,futures and parlays will of course increase the hold. but they're recommending 8 0 -8 5  %  based on looking at hold  %  in a very small sample for new books. it's betting there are fluctuations.,195
RufusPeabody,i want to add that of all the the  episodes we've recorded i think  interview of  1 1  months ago was our best. if you haven't listened to that one i highly highly highly recommend it.,184
RufusPeabody,just calling out a scammer publicly and reporting him to the bbb does nothing really. the scammer will probably shut that site down and create another one with a different persona doing the exact same thing.,207
RufusPeabody,can i ask why you're retweeting this entire conversation? what is the legal recourse? and do you really think most people can afford to take the time and pay the legal costs necessary to pursue it?,197
RufusPeabody,you can edit the line. you can submit a pick during the game. it's a great app that  developed but i think he'd agree it's not a way to verify that someone isn't falsifying their record.,186
RufusPeabody,so 1  out of 8  people who responded. is that right? and 6  of 8  said it helped them financially. and most of the people who responded were your buddies that signed up. is that right?,184

RufusPeabody,we usually don't have any edits. we just record the intro after the rest of it so things just have to get put in order plus our lovely theme music. we don't do that ourselves.,175
RufusPeabody,but not everything is about the earn. we wanted to do a podcast so we did. you're making plenty of money spank. why not just do it for fun and not be beholden to anybody?,170
RufusPeabody,yeah i'm going to have to disagree with this. i could write an essay on why these approaches don't beat the market but i'm totally fine if people go on believing this is the answer.,181
RufusPeabody,impossible to do this well on all games and not be running above expectation. i suspect you have a lot of games where you make it a 5 1  %  cover probability. helluva run though.,178

RufusPeabody,great thread about how bettors do want to educate themselves. and i think the relative success of  (7  listeners is good right?) is further proof that sports bettors are interested in more than just picks.,205
RufusPeabody,do i think having 3 0 0  entries instead of 1 5 0  in a 1 0 0  thousand  entry contest provides a *massive* advantage? no. but obviously i do get why people are upset.,167
RufusPeabody,obviously you need to have *some* arm strength to succeed. we can disqualify the danny wuerffels of the world but above a certain threshold arm strength is one of the less important attributes imo,196
RufusPeabody,"and that has nothing to do with whether i'm a ""better picker"" than other people. the only relevance my betting has is my perspective that betting my picks is better financially than selling them.",195
RufusPeabody,completely agree with this. see my tweet from yesterday. but at this point there is still a half remaining and you‚Äôre behind enough that you shouldn‚Äôt be minimizing variance at the expense of ep,194
RufusPeabody,the math still works out in that case. would still be 5 2  %  going for two and 5 0  %  for kicking pats (if pats were 1 0 0  %  which they're not),147
RufusPeabody,schwimer you literally said before that you can't advise people on the bankroll they need. yet you are claiming roi as a function of a bankroll that ended up being needed after-the-fact. that's...not good.,205

RufusPeabody,i applaud you for being selective. most bettors tend to bet too many games. with such a small number of plays it's hard to make your personal betting anything more than a hobby though.,184
RufusPeabody,i wish michael the best of luck. as far as the specifics from the podcast i have more to say on that and will try to get to it later today. (6 /6 ),147
RufusPeabody,i gave out maryland -7  on  line closed -5 .5 . is that stronger evidence that we have only 8  listeners or that we have a lot of listeners out there fading me? cc,163
RufusPeabody,you‚Äôre missing my point entirely. the point is there is would-be action that‚Äôs been limited/banned that a book could balance. this is a small slice of the pie that‚Äôs being underserved. that‚Äôs my point.,201
RufusPeabody,i didn‚Äôt make an argument. though the insinuation was that an exchange (or something peer-to-peer) makes so much sense. i was pointing out the absurdity that this is an issue in the betting world.,196
RufusPeabody,this doesn‚Äôt make sense. why is kelly lots of small losses? if you‚Äôre betting huge longshots it is but if you‚Äôre betting big favorites it‚Äôs lots of small wins and an occasional big loss.,186
RufusPeabody,3 0 /1  after r1  8 /1  after r2  laid -1 6 5  after r3 . but groups top 5 /1 0 /2 0 s round bets and rotation were all solid this week.,136

RufusPeabody,schwimer told me his week 1  line was philly -1 3  over skins with their v2  model. their v1  model had it -6 . so we‚Äôre dealing with that level of precision.,158
RufusPeabody,i was also saying you can have a model that does have value and betting based on it shows a profit but that doesn‚Äôt mean your prediction is better than the market.,163
RufusPeabody,that was one of those challenges where i had no idea if we'd get an overturn. might have been a different story if they had the full array of camera angles available.,166

RufusPeabody,btw another example of how the ravens are a smart organization they have a backup qb in rg3  with a similar (but inferior) skill set to their starter.,150
RufusPeabody,i mean if you really want to talk about documented picks you can search through the  archives or see the summary of 8  seasons of public picks here.,148
RufusPeabody,so if you‚Äôre doing your own handicapping why bother with a trend? if the market isn‚Äôt properly valuing something you should see the value just using your model,159

RufusPeabody,i think he's saying he would take +2 9 5 . but i'm not a book and if i was i wouldn't offer true odds so it's meaningless.,122
RufusPeabody,sorry that was unclear. as long as your edges aren't biased  meaning the prediction errors are centered around 0  it doesn't matter that your edge is an estimate.,162

RufusPeabody,i haven‚Äôt seen a tweet mentioning your record on free thursdays but if you were winning on those we probably would hear about it. that‚Äôs the issue.,147
RufusPeabody,releasing cfb totals on a tuesday morning üßê. and here i thought your goal was to prove you all are the best sports predictors in the world.,139
RufusPeabody,we‚Äôre not doing the washington post cfb playoff column this year. i think four people read it and it took a significant amount of time every week.,146
RufusPeabody,sorry i wasn‚Äôt able to give out more. can‚Äôt reveal my highest-edge guys since dfs lineups haven‚Äôt locked and there are many more betting opportunities this weekend.,164
RufusPeabody,or in my case no pet  pet. if/when i have kids and my travel flexibility is already shot that‚Äôs when it makes sense to get a pet.,129
RufusPeabody,if you‚Äôve got time this is the story of the worst video game of all time! (disclosure: my super talented sister ‚Å¶ hosts and produces the podcast),145
RufusPeabody,yes you can have other income. i have investment income and income from rental properties. but you know how i got that money to invest? gambling winnings.,154
RufusPeabody,i don't condone spanky's language in that screenshot. as for whether having a felony conviction bars you from entering a sports book in nj what say you,151
RufusPeabody,you were just changing the subject. you're welcome to your opinion of people hustling for outs but that doesn't have anything to do with people selling picks.,158
RufusPeabody,also please don't buy picks. you're just losing twice -- once to the book and once to the guy selling you on the fact he's a winner.,132
RufusPeabody,woodland win cashed 1 5 2 .5  thousand  plus another 4 0  thousand  in t5 /t1 0 ...but i still come out a loser this week. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,124
RufusPeabody,right i get that. but is the typical recreational bettor putting all their money on one game? probably not. the problem is the bets aren't good bets.,149
RufusPeabody,"you see people all the time saying money management had held them back from becoming a winning bettor. so i meant ""holding back"" from being a winner.",149
RufusPeabody,ballpark and weather are huge components to totals. with the decline in starting pitcher usage the impact of starting pitchers on totals is becoming smaller and smaller.,169
RufusPeabody,only sport i can see it being possible with is european soccer and you'd need to do it from someplace like the isle of mann or malta,132
RufusPeabody,i thought this one is pretty simple. much more intuitive than a team down 1 4  scoring a td and going for two in the 4 q.,121
RufusPeabody,i meant in terms of the big game management decisions. he made all the right calls going for it on 4 th downs and going for two.,128
RufusPeabody,a lot of us are critical of coaching decisions on here. i think john harbaugh made all the right decisions tonight. just didn't happen to work out.,147
RufusPeabody,i think you replied to the wrong tweet ü§™. but yes of course that includes jambos. the flawed model is what we were pointing out all along,137
RufusPeabody,i don't know how you enforce it on a large scale. looking at previous lineups from two entries you could make a pretty good forensic argument though.,149
RufusPeabody,i was just saying you should find the big nascar dfs guys and go h2 h offsite with them like you did with preston for cfb betting.,130
RufusPeabody,‚ñ∂Ô∏è conflict resolution -- liaison between bettors and regulatory authorities/books if disputes arise. (note that this doesn't mean we would blindly support all bettors in disputes.),180
RufusPeabody,sorry for all the jambos stuff on my timeline. i know most of you probably have jambos fatigue. i certainly do. will try to do better.,134
RufusPeabody,can you imagine a world where jason garrett would have understood how to play the end-of-game situation last night the way belichick and the pats did?,150
RufusPeabody,pff graded dwayne haskins as a +1 .8  last week while his qbr was like 9  i believe. didn't watch the game so can't comment further.,132
RufusPeabody,still remember my first experience with ‚Äúthe game‚Äù in 2 0 0 4 . i wore a shirt that said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt spell harvard without vd‚Äù.,126
RufusPeabody,maybe not in a specific example but in aggregate you can definitely say some people‚Äôs model/method are more right than others even if both are winners.,151
RufusPeabody,yes i know. the foles contract. but still could possibly offload it to a team like the bears who would love a foles right about now,131
RufusPeabody,it should be decided by what happens on the field as much as possible. i think you have to throw out priors. just my 2 c,120
RufusPeabody,right i was just asking why berry was calling him 'the best in the world'. he may be for all i know. i have no idea.,116
RufusPeabody,i don't know how much people invest in dfs typically but literally that is less money than i bet in one week during the football season.,136
RufusPeabody,this is a very good point. and you should be betting a  %  of your bankroll each bet not a fixed amount regardless of your bankroll.,132
RufusPeabody,i also said that i have no idea what criteria goes into winning the heisman and how much it matters if you're on a great team.,126
RufusPeabody,"i don't even know what to say to this.

actual update: halfway through the 1 7 -week package their picks have *lost* 4 .6 1  units.",131
RufusPeabody,i've been doing this for 1 0  years. so yes a little variety is nice. thought you were trolling; that's why i gave the terse reply.,131
RufusPeabody,making an adjustment for baseline difficulty level does help for 3 rd/4 th down play success. not necessary for epa obviously since it‚Äôs not a binary,149
RufusPeabody,yep. though the way i'm doing it i'm getting both value based on market moving my way and value based on line shopping in it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,127
RufusPeabody,he‚Äôs on my fantasy team. i value him a lot for fantasy. but a rb just isn‚Äôt worth that much over replacement even a great rb,124
RufusPeabody,i have darnold as a 3 .6  point upgrade over luke falk. the jets go from redskins-level stinky without him to bengals level stinky with him.,140
RufusPeabody,the fact that a system has existed in a certain way is a very poor argument for why it should continue to exist in that way.,124
RufusPeabody,"best week 5  performances in a losing effort:
jaguars (wk 5 's  effort) rams ( bears ( cowboys (

RufusPeabody,marcus mariota qb risk taking cfb futures narratives overreactions and the world's deadliest animals all discussed on this week's  plus i sing the army fight song!,163
RufusPeabody,new  from barcelona where  tries unsuccessfully not to discuss a particular tout service we cover futures and teasers in depth and give a few nfl/cfb picks.,156
RufusPeabody,right he‚Äôs saying you‚Äôre touting your record on free prop picks you give on a podcast when they do well but not when they do poorly.,132
RufusPeabody,new ‚Å¶ is up with picks for tonight‚Äôs cfb plus lots of random ‚Å¶ thoughts on his son‚Äôs future as a long snapper and deshone kizer.,128
RufusPeabody,just when you thought nfl gms were getting a little smarter... special shout out to the rams front office which doesn't seem to have any clue.,142
RufusPeabody,it‚Äôs this time of year when i think about how much easier and simpler things would be if i focused all my attention on one sport.,129
RufusPeabody,if i buy a mattress with bed bugs the right way to rectify the situation is obviously to send me two more mattresses with bed bugs.,131
RufusPeabody,become a tout? i'm fundamentally opposed to selling picks. i'm planning on starting a non-profit that is consumer protection-oriented in the betting space. does that count?,172
RufusPeabody,spank and berryhorse are using twitter to try to get accounts. anyone betting for a living needs outs. trying to get outs is not scamming people.,145
RufusPeabody,casey is 8 -for-1 9  w/ a share of 5 4 -hole lead. granted the wins are generally on the euro tour and a decade ago,115
RufusPeabody,figured it might have to do with just moving one side when they take action but you'd think they'd have software that can move both sides,137
RufusPeabody,this is a regulation billy. i lived in vegas for many years and i'm sure any of the bookmaker/industry people out there will back that up.,138
RufusPeabody,that's a valid point. my issue with it is basically these are markets where the house edge is massive which the average bettor may not understand.,146
RufusPeabody,hockey analytics people: what‚Äôs the optimal time to pull the goalie when you‚Äôre down two? how does that change if you have problems controlling the puck?,153
RufusPeabody,let me lay out this hypothetical: every recreational bettor is +ev but overbets their bankroll. the sportsbook will lose money overall and bettors will win overall.,164
RufusPeabody,retirement sounds so boring. i‚Äôve hit that point but when what i do for fun is also what i do for a living why would i?,119
RufusPeabody,card counting isn‚Äôt illegal. it‚Äôs using your brain to gain an edge. there‚Äôs a reason  and others were never charged with any crimes from card counting.,151
RufusPeabody,1 7 . i forgot g-mac lipsky and janewattaeatasdfasdfasd the first time all of whom still are worse than 1 0 0 0 /1  to win.,123
RufusPeabody,...but we have no way of knowing who they are ahead of time. if you fade bettors who have done exceptionally poorly you will still lose.,136
RufusPeabody,sure they can hit 4 0  %  over a limited sample but their expectation isn‚Äôt going to be much worse than 4 8 -4 9  % ,116
RufusPeabody,on the pga tour ever? not an easy way to see -- would have to look through a bunch of google sheets with my sim numbers.,120
RufusPeabody,some books do open before offshore for very small limits. you know what happens when offshore opens? voila their odds change to mirror the offshore number.,155
RufusPeabody,you're right. you'll never be able to solve this issue but if you can put some safeguards in place and help some people that's worth something.,143
RufusPeabody,this is a good point. they're evaluating based on what info they have. it also leads to a huge advantage for someone who's successfully executed before.,152
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm not hedging my titans futures with money but i am hedging with time ‚Äî all my advance super bowl prop research presumes a chiefs win.,136
RufusPeabody,haha yeah that's where i'm at too. losing the ravens futures sucks but if the titans end up shipping it it's best possible result for me.,137
RufusPeabody,if you looked at it over the course of many contests you could determine with a large degree of confidence i suppose. with one contest? nah.,140
RufusPeabody,i buried the lede. what matters more is that a titans win increases the value of the ticket by about  $ 5 0 0 .,111
RufusPeabody,if you'd like to talk to me about it please shoot me a dm. i want to get as many different perspectives as i can.,113
RufusPeabody,don't forget the pillars of jambos: transparency and integrity. there has literally never been anyone in the history of transparency that is more transparent than,162
RufusPeabody,i've never bet on cbb before. i'm working on something with it now but this will be year 1  for me (if i get there),115
RufusPeabody,the xroi makes sense. .5 6 1 4 /.5 2 3 8 -1 . but don't know where you're getting your xroi w/ vig number,105
RufusPeabody,no they had 1 3  weekly subs the first week in october and had ~ 5 0  subs for the first 1 0 -week service.,107
RufusPeabody,i‚Äòm being told there are three picks that will go 3 -0  and then i should put all my winnings on the sunday night game.,119
RufusPeabody,some unsolicited feedback for  not a good look to give out a correlated parlay which the book whose lines you use (betcris) won‚Äôt even allow!,141
RufusPeabody,tom! too bad i didn't run into you. what a game! do you still have to send cash in the mail to get his pickz?,109
RufusPeabody,you want to reward wins and losses too. how often is the super bowl the two best teams. we have no issue with that though.,122
RufusPeabody,great pod   got me thinking ‚Äîhow does the difficulty of qbs improving accuracy compare to basketball players improving shooting ability or baseball pitchers improving control?,175
RufusPeabody,cbb not a big market especially at this time of year. doesn't take much to move a line. i'm guessing some people followed the picks.,132
RufusPeabody,i had ou as 6 3  %  to finish the season undefeated going into today so i don't think them winning out is a stretch.,116
RufusPeabody,great bit on ravens building around who lamar jackson is rather than trying to turn him into something different. ravens organization is a great model.,151
RufusPeabody,most of my bets are right around even money odds. i'm typically risking  $ 5 5 0 0  to win  $ 5 0 0 0,101
RufusPeabody,it can still be good. the forecast can be way off but it can have signal in the right direction. the two aren't mutually exclusive.,131
RufusPeabody,you could fake it till you make it. the lines between charm vision bullsh*t and fraud have become so narrow as to be one line.,126
RufusPeabody,i spent an hour this morning on the phone with you guys. can‚Äôt raise wire limits without going into a branch. not a great policy.,129
RufusPeabody,there are always opportunities but it gets harder and harder. you need to be looking at things in a unique way or possess better information.,141
RufusPeabody,"i'm in vegas and i'm going to record a podcast in-person(!) with  and  wheeeeeeeeüòÄüòÉü¶Ñüëçüêï 
(it's only slightly weird that it's in jeff's hotel room right?)",152
RufusPeabody,"that's a good point. though selling picks is also ""transmitting wagering information"" so one could argue that a tout is also violating the wire act.",148
RufusPeabody,people are literally paying for picks with no idea if the pick seller is a long term winner. or even medium term for that matter.,129
RufusPeabody,as a general rule a tout outfit that does not prominently display its handicappers‚Äô long-term track record is obfuscating the truth to preserve its business.,157
RufusPeabody,that‚Äôs a big part of it. easy to under or overshrink depending on what you‚Äôre betting into vs what you used to calibrate the shrinkage,134
RufusPeabody,the degree to which that makes it suboptimal i‚Äôm not sure of but you could run some sims to find out if you do desired.,119
RufusPeabody,the irs definitely allows for some leeway. but in my opinion if the majority of your income comes from gambling you are a professional gambler.,143
RufusPeabody,dj -1 8 6 /tiger +1 4 0 . why do they have both that and koepka -1 9 5 /tiger +1 3 5 ?,86

RufusPeabody,icymi  was our guest on  where he discusses his historic jeopardy run and the analytics behind it as well as his approach to betting sports.,140
RufusPeabody,the conversation was in regard to kelly criterion and staking iirc. if you don‚Äôt have an edge your optimal stake should always be 0  % ,135
RufusPeabody,i think it‚Äôs a fair sample of the most visible ones. but if you‚Äôd like to do a thorough study i‚Äôd love to see it,112
RufusPeabody,so what you're saying is they're comingling their bankroll with their subscription fees. if they actually tracked their bets they'd have a pretty clear idea.,157
RufusPeabody,you are completely missing my point!! i do not buy picks from either of them personally. and i'm in the business of maximizing my profits.,138
RufusPeabody,excited to have  and  on  this week to discuss their forthcoming book ‚Äúthe logic of sports betting‚Äù! pod should drop in the next few days.,138
RufusPeabody,it takes skill -- and statistical models -- to find the value. the true win rate of sports bettors does not follow a normal distribution.,137
RufusPeabody,the super bowl is one of the only events where public money is driving the line. (world cup also) you are cherrypicking a few events.,133
RufusPeabody,can someone please explain to me what sort of process would generate ats results with an expectation of 4 5  % ? i‚Äôm all ears.,126
RufusPeabody,so he sells picks and receives a cut of his clients' losses who sign up using his promo code. no conflict of interest there üôÑ,125
RufusPeabody,it's similar to betting the haws to win the 1 8 -1 9  nba championship if their roster was made up of middle school kids.,121
RufusPeabody,um no it wasn't. it was a response to someone repying to samkon. ras quote retweeted it. it had literally nothing to do with ras.,129
RufusPeabody,yass drawing parallels to financial markets. it would be fantastic if things went this way and we saw a true market. i like this guy!,133
RufusPeabody,you do realize you‚Äôll hit 1 1  of 1 2  legs 1 2  times more often than you‚Äôll hit a 1 2 -leg parlay right?,106
RufusPeabody,i understand that if i had a stretch of over 2 0 0 0  picks where i wasn‚Äôt up i‚Äôd need to rethink my profession.,112
RufusPeabody,would pay to listen to a    discussion. unfortunately i think schwim realizes that lloyd is on a whole different level and it wouldn't be pretty.,145
RufusPeabody,i would venture to guess if you queried all two-point conversions like that one you'd find the success rate to be just about the same.,134
RufusPeabody,if you knew they would fail on the first 2 -point try then obviously you would never go for it. but you can't know that.,120
RufusPeabody,wait was schwimer using my name to try to promote jambos during the week i was at burning man and i somehow missed it? wow.,123
RufusPeabody,i don't need to verify it. i don't need you to believe me. this isn't a dick measuring contest. it's how i make a living.,121
RufusPeabody,i'm about to release a letter from an accounting firm saying that i told them i won 2 2 1  units last year. stay tuned.,119
RufusPeabody,that ticket has a value of about  $ 1 0 0 0  right now so i would say not a lot on the line.,92
RufusPeabody,new  pod where  and i discuss nfl week 1 7  and how it‚Äôs a different animal. we also go over next monday‚Äôs bowl games.,118
RufusPeabody,when you win betting small markets and props you get limited unfortunately. betting blatant errors and then crying foul makes us all look bad.,142
RufusPeabody,"and the teams with the lowest net hidden ypp:

RufusPeabody,is it just me or is there a one-second grace period on delay-of-game penalties in the past few years that definitely didn‚Äôt exist before?,137
RufusPeabody,i've never understood why dislocations take time to heal. like it was popped back into place. it's exactly where it's supposed to be now.,137
RufusPeabody,i don't care about explaining them. i care about ascertaining what actually happened with the picks from 1 2 /8  - 2 /1 3,121
RufusPeabody,"look i want to get to the bottom of this. the ""report"" is bs. it doesn't verify anything. i just want the truth here.",117
RufusPeabody,i'm certainly not saying no books will take that. plenty will. but cris typically doesn't -- at least that has been my personal experience.,139
RufusPeabody,haha yes we have looked thoroughly. they brought me into the whole mess actually. michael claimed i endorsed their business model (i did not),141
RufusPeabody,the point of that statement is that there's upside not that the pay will be awful. certainly willing to pay for the right candidate.,132
RufusPeabody,gain from going to 8 -2  less than loss going to 7 -3  for seahawks. both teams should have been ok with a tie.,111
RufusPeabody,chance the assumptions and re-do the math. assuming 1 0 0  %  pat %  the break-even 2 -pt rate is ~3 8  % .,107
RufusPeabody,mp now-cast with relevant components. the mp curr yr rank is  inseason rating (w/ priors only used to adjust in determining strength of opponent),145
RufusPeabody,bruce allen during his press conference is doubling down on the quality of the skins' talent. because obviously none of this is his fault.,138
RufusPeabody,not trying to get into this again but i have to agree with  this is just another tout service doing typical tout service antics.,128
RufusPeabody,e-rep? nfl sides don‚Äôt have huge edges. sure i could get down more on game day but edges are much smaller at that point.,120
RufusPeabody,are you saying yikes bc guys i gave a combined 1 4  %  chance of winning at the time are not going to win?,106
RufusPeabody,also i'd only get casey and hatton for  $ 1 0 0 . not a lot of liquidity -- and this is a major,95
RufusPeabody,if you have a good long-term record hell yes you are showing it. you are designing your whole site around making it super visible.,130
RufusPeabody,i actually agree with that. i would have been finished by the time i actually got on the plane (if i had the opportunity),121
RufusPeabody,i stand by my opposition to full kelly with probabilities that aren‚Äôt explicitly known. furthermore i still have no idea how to define ‚Äúbankroll‚Äù,145
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm jealous of that right now. feel like i‚Äôm juggling too much! so you think you‚Äôll improve at the same rate as the market?,123
RufusPeabody,my point exactly. and what often ends up happening if they‚Äôre really good is the syndicates approach the handicapper about working with them exclusively.,153
RufusPeabody,and how many touts are hitting 5 5  %  long-term without fudging their record of using stale lines? 0 .1 -0 .2  %  maybe?,121

RufusPeabody,with tickpick you don't even see the service fee. well they say it's  $ 0  but that's bullshit. how much is the seller getting?,127
RufusPeabody,i define bankroll differently than most (i think). to me if you're busto there is no reloading. that's all the money you got pal.,129
RufusPeabody,luckily my bottom line isn‚Äôt influenced by your opinion. i‚Äôve always taken going ‚Äúbust‚Äù to mean losing it all. it‚Äôs why i bet conservatively.,141
RufusPeabody,in my opinion it's easier to make money by finding an edge researching and modeling yourself than it is to make money buying picks.,131
RufusPeabody,assuming a 5  %  discount rate you'd need the under to have a 1 6 7  %  chance of winning to break even ü§£,105
RufusPeabody,i am using an analogy to make a broader point. your comment is inane and doesn't address the point i'm making in this thread.,125
RufusPeabody,i had an 0 -1 2  day betting mlb last season. what does that prove? nothing. i returned 4 .9  %  on the season.,111
RufusPeabody,very true. look at what happens when the don best screen goes down and the legal books don't have their pinnacle and cris feeds.,128
RufusPeabody,ed's been saying this was going to be a big deal for the last 6  weeks. most people are not taking this seriously enough.,121

RufusPeabody,i enjoyed football more this year than i have in awhile. and i say that despite it not being a particularly noteworthy year results-wise.,137
RufusPeabody,thought my airpod mic was messed up but after angling it differently it turns out my scraggly beard was the cause of the problem.,129
RufusPeabody,agree results have been garbage these last two weeks. luckily my track record is a lot longer than that and has been quite profitable.,134
RufusPeabody,to be fair this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. dk just takes rake so they are paying out the same amount of money regardless.,133
RufusPeabody,it's more of a pr issue than an actual issue. how do they make it right from a pr standpoint is the real question.,114
RufusPeabody,based on what they did after the sbnc i doubt it. they didn't give me anything besides a 'we're sorry for the regrettable experience',133
RufusPeabody,i know. and the more i learn about a lot of companies the more i realize many are missing the adults in the room.,113
RufusPeabody,i did not see every play. i signed up for your site back in march. that does not mean i was monitoring your plays.,114

RufusPeabody,mostly chance of beating lsu. but if the dominoes fall correctly (and they show well vs. lsu) they are not out of it,116
RufusPeabody,to be fair i think machine learning has lots of great applications in sports modeling but wouldn‚Äôt approach the entire process that way.,136
RufusPeabody,was referring to gary danielson telling gene salvatore that he couldn't be the first to touch the ball after being out of bounds.,129
RufusPeabody,this is not how good the teams are; it's what our model of the cfb playoff committee projects the rankings would be now.,120
RufusPeabody,winning a conference championship is worth something. not saying it should or shouldn't but the committee has given it weight in the past.,138
RufusPeabody,i don't think you can say yes with certainty. and lsu has a 2 9 .5  %  chance of losing 2 + games,97

RufusPeabody,in my years on  i have never seen a more unifying figure than  mike you have done what i thought was never possible.,116
RufusPeabody,when books report these big bets you can be sure they‚Äôre not from sharps. only losing players able to bet above house limits.,125
RufusPeabody,then feel free to ignore them. but the thought that you have any idea what has value in the betting market is laughable.,120

RufusPeabody,i thought these guys weren't going to cut sharp limits  they seem to be doing it more aggressively than any other nj book.,122
RufusPeabody,not good! only got 9  in. started +1 0  through 5  holes before getting it together. ended up w/ a 4 7 .,104
RufusPeabody,...yet people continually make inferences based off of small/non-random samples. understanding randomness is perhaps the most important skill to being a winning bettor.,168
RufusPeabody,why do hockey teams pull their best goalie just because he allowed a few goals? seems like an overreaction to small sample size.,128
RufusPeabody,i had heard a rumor they were better in nj. had to find out. at least i made some money off them today!,103
RufusPeabody,...and what‚Äôs wrong with the industry! very happy for you to point me to the large number of ethical ones you are mentioning.,125
RufusPeabody,i made him over 1 0 0 0 /1  to start the week! but had value on him after two rounds. kinda shocking.,101
RufusPeabody,i get your point doug but you're quoting a very small sample size. what's the base rate over the last 1 0  years?,113
RufusPeabody,yeah but it‚Äôs not a two way market. overround is what 1 5 0  % ? ticket worth not worth close to that,101
RufusPeabody,people who are allowed to fire big like this are most assuredly *not* sharps. they are rich businessmen who give big casino action.,131
RufusPeabody,i remember when he tried to sell me on the tout idea. he had a little presentation projecting 1  million subscribers. not joking.,129
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm in an airport looking at a small tv with have no volume so counting on twitter to understand what‚Äôs going on.,113
RufusPeabody,has anyone ever thought they won their fantasy title only to find out two days later they lost on a stat correction?,116
RufusPeabody,need to bench one of: lockett robinson boone cooper and sanders. up to 3 7  % . opp does have russell wilson.,109
RufusPeabody,"because i don‚Äôt want to go broke. process  outcome.
congrats to the guy on his wins. hoping he quits while he‚Äôs ahead.",118
RufusPeabody,awesome! and thanks for the re-education. i wasn't old enough to understand all the wheelings and dealings in the mid-9 0 s.,124
RufusPeabody,last spring schwimer told me he expected mlb to be a small winner but not to be nearly as strong as basketball.,111
RufusPeabody,watching this video it's obvious to me now that harvard converts here if  on harvard doesn't whiff on his block. thanks bud.,124
RufusPeabody,so if i met sean mcvay once does this mean i won‚Äôt be getting any interviews for head coaching gigs this offseason?,115
RufusPeabody,what's the problem they solved at bla? how to give money to poor dominicans in exchange for a  %  of future earnings?,117
RufusPeabody,people who think they have everything figured out ... generally don't. the more you know the more you realize you don't know.,125
RufusPeabody,in fairness it doesn‚Äôt look like the edits always help jambos (though they seem to on the majority of those you posted),119
RufusPeabody,i should have remembered that. jeff and i had dinner with both those guys that night. (see i can name drop too,110
RufusPeabody,depends on how you define arm strength. recent history brees and luck certainly didn't have great arm strength coming out of college.,133
RufusPeabody,wait maybe i'm not understanding you properly. i don't sell picks. i don't sell anything. just want to make that perfectly clear.,129
RufusPeabody,how strongly you hold onto a prior should be proportional to the amount and quality of data that prior is based on.,115
RufusPeabody,did you see my other tweets on the matter. it's more of a general topic for touts than something specific to jambos.,116
RufusPeabody,the only people who are posting those are in the supercontest. and they still can't bet those lines. they're just contest lines.,128
RufusPeabody,rules like that should generally be listed at all books. if the prop is tackles and assists they‚Äôre each worth 1 .,114
RufusPeabody,that sounds about right actually. i‚Äôm guessing i‚Äôll have it in the low 2 0  % s when i run simulations tmw,106
RufusPeabody,i still have to engage what daniel kahneman calls system 2  to figure out whether fcs is the good one or not,108
RufusPeabody,edge is really pretty meaningless in that context. i use edge and ev synonymously and calculate them the way you're calculating ev.,131
RufusPeabody,thread summarizing the   podcast discussion. have a lot to say on this and will try to ‚úèÔ∏è on my flight this afternoon.,117
RufusPeabody,the problem is i'll be in spain for the next 1 0  days. i need to be able to do this online.,92
RufusPeabody,yes but we‚Äôre a little behind this week. i‚Äôm playing catch up after burning man and hadnt completely finished some offseason work.,130
RufusPeabody,for anyone who's been to burning man: what's something you'd really regret not bringing that isn't on all the checklists? first-timer here.,139
RufusPeabody,that‚Äôs like saying imagine statistics can beat the market. regression analysis has made me lots of money. great tool for answering questions,140
RufusPeabody,lol. obviously it's not being read that way. making a point that nobody knows what the fuck the wire act really means.,118
RufusPeabody,"üöÄ mortgage win probs entering r4 : 
lashley 8 7  %  poston 5  %  reed 1 .8  %  tringale 1 .7  % ",96
RufusPeabody,every tout that messages me tells me they‚Äôre part of the 1  %  of touts that provide value. what are the odds?!,111
RufusPeabody,not a bad guess. he has 9  top 5 s with no wins but he's still a half-dozen short of our leader.,96
RufusPeabody,i don‚Äôt think those systems have had any edges over the market for a long time. i strongly disagree with your statement.,120
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm not bragging. i said i lost overall!! i do try to help others. i gave out woodland as a play on,99
RufusPeabody,i would suggest someone yell during his backswing but i don‚Äôt think that would even affect koepka. he is a freaking machine.,124
RufusPeabody,not a two-way market so public can drive down the price without sharps being able to come in and balance it out.,112
RufusPeabody,meaning if you ran sim using no-vig close (or your projections regressed to market) as true price how would that volatility compare?,132
RufusPeabody,not sure why you hate the article so much. spanky saw an opportunity in the sports betting world and he exploited it.,117
RufusPeabody,not saying there aren‚Äôt inefficiencies in the closing line ‚Äî just that the closing line will still be more efficient than before,128
RufusPeabody,new jersey  -- power ranking time. how would you rank the operators in your state (    resorts   caesars  hard rock golden nugget,129
RufusPeabody,you make a good point. full disclosure: i asked ed why he gave a manuscript to fezzik. let‚Äôs go to the source:,110
RufusPeabody,you don't need a monte carlo sim. you just need the binomial distribution which is what i was quoting numbers based on.,119
RufusPeabody,hell he's more likely to get struck by lightning while playing in the byron nelson than he is to win the tournament.,116
RufusPeabody,do you really think a book could offer -1 2 5 /-1 2 5  on nfl sides and get any real handle?,92
RufusPeabody,and did you see the elasticity of demand part? and saying higher hold equals less revenue. this is a piece of garbage.,118
RufusPeabody,love the idea. the problem is cost. there are a ton of sites and even more play types and they're not cheap.,108
RufusPeabody,what it is is a good deal for the syndicate that's getting the good prices and a bad deal for everyone else.,108
RufusPeabody,"the ""lose a ton of money to gain market share"" strategy is not looking so hot right now for us sportsbook operators.",116
RufusPeabody,fyi  and i will be recording a live  from  at 2 :4 5 pm from the room where they do the podcasts.,97
RufusPeabody,scott hend at chapultepec is certainly going to be interesting. the man has never met a hole that wasn't a driver hole.,119
RufusPeabody,there is no option to unregister an account on your site. i don't think that's legal. can you please fix this pronto.,117
RufusPeabody,i love when people add records months later. very transparent. not fishy at all. i love how honest and transparent touts are.,125
RufusPeabody,no i was in philly for a charity ball on saturday night but then spent a day hitting the books in ac,100
RufusPeabody,just went to check in for my flight to philly tomorrow only to discover i had booked a flight to boston ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,105
RufusPeabody,big thank you to    and the rest of the team at  they run a first-class operation and are fair to all bettors.,110
RufusPeabody,just like last week and the week before that  and i recorded a  episode this week. we talk nfl playoffs mostly. .,113
RufusPeabody,ask any dfs player. there are dfs groups that are doing this every week. they are just not as obvious about it.,111
RufusPeabody,in general if someone will not produce evidence or details to substantiate a claim they make they are trying to mislead you.,124
RufusPeabody,this is how i make a living. so of course i do better than jambos or i would be on the streets,94
RufusPeabody,i'm not endorsing that. that's a decision operators have to make. but if they offer a product it needs to be fair.,114
RufusPeabody,if you‚Äôre the seahawks would you rather lose tonight and play at philly or win the division and host the vikings?,113
RufusPeabody,a true nightmare ‚Äî my directv on the flight stopped working after that osu td and failure to go for two.,104
RufusPeabody,nice start to the day with unc and mich state. thoughts and prayers to anyone who had the mich state/wake over.,111
RufusPeabody,so far spanky is the only confirmed subscriber i know of. and he was just betting against their picks being positive,116
RufusPeabody,you‚Äôve obviously had a similar experience to many other sharps in new jersey. i was talking about betting the blatant mistakes.,127
RufusPeabody,uh they wouldn‚Äôt be first. not even close. you can buy or sell half-runs at many shops. ever heard of pinnacle?,111
RufusPeabody,"was just trying to come up with a way to frame some of this for discussion. some insight into the ""why""",103
RufusPeabody,i absolutely unequivocally believe nobody should ever be called out in the gambling space. what kind of monster would do that,125
RufusPeabody,kids don‚Äôt buy the half-point onto an nfl total and definitely not onto 4 8  (half-point there worth about 5  cents),116
RufusPeabody,definitely. beating oregon is not as impressive of a win as if they had come in undefeated in pac-1 2  play.,108
RufusPeabody,i have that scenario only occurring in 0 .6  %  of sims so std error in those numbers is relatively high,104
RufusPeabody,"over under standard mr-1 0 0 -1 2

RufusPeabody,basic distributions here. you can argue it's not exactly poisson and i agree that it's not but it's not far off.,112
RufusPeabody,seems like a reasonable and respectful question to me. schwim only taking questions via dm. someone want to send it along?,122
RufusPeabody,also just no. oklahoma has been my  team in the country without priors. so this tweet doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.,111
RufusPeabody,üëèüèªüëèüèª i started going to therapy a few years back and wish i had started sooner. mental health is so important.,108
RufusPeabody,which is how guys like mitch trubisky get taken  overall. i think arm strength is given too much weight by scouts.,114
RufusPeabody,latest episode of  is up where  and i discuss how joe burrow and qb evaluation in-depth plus give some football picks.,118
RufusPeabody,agree. and i hope  doesn't think i'm attacking him here. i know he's very cognizant of his effect on the market.,112
RufusPeabody,so i guess there's not a simple answer since you have time to tweet that you don't have time to tweet.,102
RufusPeabody,how do you go about determining who the best dfs player in the world is? isn't this guy a dfs tout?,99
RufusPeabody,i do believe they exist. i just believe it's very difficult to pinpoint what is and isn't a let-down game beforehand.,117
RufusPeabody,big thank you to  for his hot tip on the over which was 1 0 0 0 0  %  correct üôÉ,79
RufusPeabody,underrated part of modeling sports -- finding klugey solutions. the data is never perfect. thinking creatively and finding work-arounds is essential.,149
RufusPeabody,of course! to properly quantify it you need to know how much a move from -3  to -3 .5  is worth.,96
RufusPeabody,train your staff better. or don‚Äôt take parlays. but don‚Äôt write a ticket and then say it‚Äôs void after it wins.,110
RufusPeabody,yes zero compensation. i wasn‚Äôt working there i was spending a few days a week talking to mike and the team.,108
RufusPeabody,"but when their ceo promotes it as ""we're offering you this bet at +2 3 0 "" it becomes more problematic.",103
RufusPeabody,these are situations where i kind of expect newton to take a sack to take his team out of fg range.,99
RufusPeabody,yeah recorded it today. not huge on football. we talk about the hot topic on twitter the last week plenty though,112
RufusPeabody,this space = twitter. i think i conveyed the issues endemic to your business model pretty well. what am i missing?,114
RufusPeabody,i‚Äôd be a much better bettor if i bet more on my winning bets and less on my losing bets. üôÉ,90
RufusPeabody,yes. i honestly think the most valuable trait i have is my resiliency. losing has always motivated me to work harder.,117
RufusPeabody,the hat was for sun protection! also it‚Äôs turned into my lucky ball-striking hat and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. thanks brady! üëç,122
RufusPeabody,i honestly don't know all the details about this but i thought it was just a very public betting partner arrangement.,117

RufusPeabody,bland hasn't held a solo 5 4 -hole lead but is 0 -for-2  w/ a share of 5 4 -hole lead,85

RufusPeabody,"the same poll but i used ""i"" and this isn't about me. it's trying to settle a debate with a friend.",99
RufusPeabody,well these prices were there at 1 am last night and also there at 1 1 :3 0 am this morning.,91
RufusPeabody,in the last week i‚Äôve met two people with dogs named rufus one with a rabbit named rufus and now this.,102
RufusPeabody,are you a better or worse bettor than the average person responding to this poll (typical person following me on twitter)?,122
RufusPeabody,wander around the center city. get lost (easy with the city layout) but not too lost that you miss your flight,110
RufusPeabody,look obviously maximizing expected profit on a bet is not the name of the game. kelly maximizes expectation of bankroll growth,126
RufusPeabody,i was making the point that it becomes a bigger and bigger issue because of low limits and banning winning bettors.,115
RufusPeabody,thanks for this. i honestly didn‚Äôt know rest had such an effect on goalie performance. don‚Äôt watch a lot of hockey.,115
RufusPeabody,this is *exactly* my point joseph. sure you will have guys that hit 4 5  %  but that's not their expectation.,109
RufusPeabody,over 4 9  %  on ats markets on straight bets yes. what do you think the average bettor hits on those?,101
RufusPeabody,if you can predict someone who‚Äôs ats plays will win at less than 4 7 .6  %  before-the-fact i‚Äôd be shocked.,107

RufusPeabody,it's the bubble i live in. it's the bubble i know. and it's going to become a bigger problem with legalization.,111
RufusPeabody,but i do agree with your point! all these people in the app generation don't know how to talk to someone.,105
RufusPeabody,could have something that uses the wa price at time of release for tracking and identifies if there was a discrepancy.,118
RufusPeabody,well that‚Äôs false. less than 1 4 0  thousand  have tested positive. many people who have it have not been tested.,113
RufusPeabody,was waiting for this. yass railing against wire act. obviously this needs to disappear for an exchange to really take off.,122
RufusPeabody,i remember when he told me cville would eventually be his biggest group of supporters. looks like that dream has died.,118
RufusPeabody,did you try to double on a 1 4  against a 7  again or was that a one time deal üòÇ,80
RufusPeabody,nowhere in dk‚Äôs statement or your article does it say she will receive no money. where are you getting that from?,113
RufusPeabody,futures from preseason/early season. would not have bet futures entering postseason. you'd be better off rolling over mls at that point.,136
RufusPeabody,oh i found big issues with their mlb accounting. go back on schwim‚Äôs timeline to june and i pointed it out,106
RufusPeabody,it‚Äôs almost like this was foreseeable  and people who were pointing this out actually knew what they were talking about...,122
RufusPeabody,generous promos and odds boosts are a result of a competitive market. a competitive market benefits pros and recreational bettors.,130
RufusPeabody,agree. we need (a) a way to educate people and (b) a way to unite to make our voice heard,89
RufusPeabody,what's interesting is schwimer is making the argument that jambos clv is amazing while danshan says it is not good.,115
RufusPeabody,in all honesty i think we know that most of the 7  people listening are awesome smart people. was tongue-in-cheek,113
RufusPeabody,so you‚Äôre saying your model doesn‚Äôt beat the market. which runs counter to all your claims of ml knowing all,108
RufusPeabody,please elaborate... i say nothing about what the job actually entails how much it pays and you don't know me.,109
RufusPeabody,but i have 5  years of data. granted the composition of the committee changed a bit from year to year,101
RufusPeabody,no you have oklahoma and utah who could be 1 -loss p5  champs. plus alabama and georgia could both lose.,104
RufusPeabody,down 1 7  in the 4 th quarter win in double ot as darkness falls. (no lights climate change protest),100
RufusPeabody,for jeff and i the only time required is prepping for it and recording. we don't do the production ourselves.,109
RufusPeabody,thanks bob. how much of an outlier is that (i was thinking something like a coach or qb-level mixed effect),107
RufusPeabody,i wouldn't say that. if i had a time machine i would have looked into it 1 0  years ago.,88
RufusPeabody,want to look at who everyone else has picked. but it all depends on structure of payout. is it winner-take-all?,111
RufusPeabody,honestly it makes no sense chris. when i try to model what the committee is grading on it‚Äôs completely inconsistent.,116
RufusPeabody,this is why i loved the sat. it‚Äôs not a test of knowledge but of problem solving. so many shortcuts.,100
RufusPeabody,what do you think the college football rankings should be based on? best teams (predictively)? most deserving? some other criteria?,131
RufusPeabody,if you don‚Äôt have st err for the prior how do you know how much to weight results you see?,90
RufusPeabody,he says he has documented records. you say your picks are verified by a top-1 0  nationally recognized accounting firm.,119
RufusPeabody,have you seen those pictures of vegas dave with those huge stacks of money? that‚Äôs how you know someone legit.,110
RufusPeabody,also can someone tell me how to post snippets of spreadsheets in a tweet? i am clearly behind the times.,104
RufusPeabody,might want to re-examine your estimated probabilities adam. with the stickiness of numbers a simple smoothing approach is not ideal.,132
RufusPeabody,additionally the terms of service provide for arbitration to decide any disputes and do not allow for class action lawsuits.,124
RufusPeabody,too much noise to model player-specific. need info on swing changes injuries equipment changes etc to do anything meaningful imo,128
RufusPeabody,what's the bet? i can bet as many plays as i want in nj at  $ 2 0  a pop.,73

RufusPeabody,for me it's an issue of incentives. so yes i believe co-investing is a better model than selling picks.,103

RufusPeabody,good point. the optimal usage rate isn‚Äôt zero but fades are certainly overused in today‚Äôs nfl,93

RufusPeabody,this is why it makes so much sense for small cap bettors to attack smaller markets.,83

RufusPeabody,plenty of governments would do the same thing if they thought their image could be tarnished.,93
RufusPeabody,same way i ended up making money on the masters despite losing 6  figures fading molinari,89
RufusPeabody,understand why it may seem that way without knowledge of the inner workings of the model.,89
RufusPeabody,was this day-of mlb sides joey? would like to see a pic if that‚Äôs the case,74
RufusPeabody,depends on how much you plan on spending! short answer: 2 5  times your annual expenses.,88
RufusPeabody,why would that change the incentives? you don‚Äôt get penalized more for losing by multiple goals!,96

RufusPeabody,i‚Äôm just saying ‚Äî exceptionally low leverage situation and you‚Äôre using an arm you could save,93
RufusPeabody,is the market inefficient enough that you can win (or lose) just based on that though?,86
RufusPeabody,though my business partner apparently had one recently so maybe it wasn‚Äôt an excuse after all.,94
RufusPeabody,based on how much weight 2  professional events have had at predicting a 3 rd historically,90
RufusPeabody,risking  $ 1  at -1 4 3  odds would be a -1 5  %  expected roi.,63
