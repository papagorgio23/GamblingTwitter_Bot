12Xpert,"since the start of the current season these are  3 8 -game running points totals. previous record was 1 0 2  held by man city and chelsea. insane.

12Xpert,"for the record here are the figures for homes.

12Xpert,so here's how it goes. match a opens with a line of 2 1 0  and closes with 2 0 5 . 'true' line is 2 0 0 . match finishes with 2 0 0 . match b opens with a line of 1 9 0  and closes with 1 9 5 . 'true' line is 2 0 0 . match finishes with 2 0 0  average closing line is 2 0 0  and average result is 2 0 0 .,304
12Xpert,i guess this is kind of obvious but in a sample of 1 6 2 6 5 4  football matches the ratio of the opening to closing 1  times 2  odds ( was bigger for the 1 6 2 6 5 4  winners (1 .0 0 5 9 ) than the 3 2 5 3 0 8  losers (0 .9 9 4 5 ). the difference is significant. t = 3 8  p-value = 3 e-3 1 6 .,295
12Xpert,you have over at 1 .9 5  and under at 1 .9 5 . 5 0  %  chance of either. bet over and your expectation is (0 .5  times 0 .9 5 )-0 .5  = -0 .0 2 5 . bet under and its the same. bet both together its still the same. 1 0 0  matches like this 5 0  finish over 5 0  under. total stakes = 2 0 0  loss = -5  = -2 .5  % ,312
12Xpert,but if zoom in on the k's that matter then you can see more clearly the impact of having a bit of skill. in this monte carlo run the 5 0  %  bettor had a probability of 3 8 .4  %  of seeing a 1 0 . for the 4 8  %  bettor it was 4 4 .1  % . for the 5 2  %  bettor it was 2 8 .1  % .,281
12Xpert,but in general i'd say it's no different. of the sample of 3 4 4 5  bwin poker players i discussed in my book just 3 8 3  or 1 1  %  were profitable (similar to sport) and most of them will have been lucky. of those 3 8 3  9 1  %  of the profits went to 2 0  %  of them with 4 0  %  going to the top 5 .,303
12Xpert,that is indeed how i'm doing it. i think there are two errors here. first loss  %  is 5 1  %  not 4 9  % . second i think the answer you get using 6 4 1  and 0 .4 9  which is indeed 0 .5 1 1  is not a percentage but an expected number of times occurring. you want this number to be 1  for 5 0 -5 0 .,299
12Xpert,this is in stark contrast to the current increasingly frenzied attack on the gambling industry by the  who have already published 1 8  stories about gambling this month alone compared 1 0  in january 2 0 1 9  1 1  in jan 2 0 1 8  7  in jan 2 0 1 7  6  in jan 2 0 1 6 . 1 2 1  in all of 2 0 1 9 .,295
12Xpert,using wiki there have been 3 8 1  sackings to date since inception of premier league. the average time a manager sacked in 2 0 0 0  had been in place was 6 6 6  days. based on the whole data set this was below par (which was 8 1 0  days). in 2 0 1 9  it is 6 1 3  days which is above par (5 3 6  days).,302
12Xpert,"more robust than average odds.
assuming your numbers e(k) for k = 2 5  is about 0 .2 1 . so seeing 2 5  is not implausible. run a monte carlo to see how often you see sequences of 2 1  losses (and 2 5 ) in 4 7 5 6  bets. this is what i got. a 2 5  happened at least once 6 .7 2  %  of the time.",294
12Xpert,"i'd say that's ""pareto principle"" for you or the ""8 0 -2 0  rule"". 8 0  %  of the profits come from 2 0  %  of the winning bets. depending on how you look at it things can be far more extreme than that. in 9 4 4 3  woc bets the overall profit is 3 8 3 .6 1 . all of it comes from just 2 3  of them.",298
12Xpert,and via a monte carlo sim that is what i find for all bets with expected win  %  5 7  % . now i re-run by having 4 3  consecutive bets of xwin %  3 9  %  followed by1 0 3  with 6 4 .5  %  (making 5 7  %  average). this time the average number of 3 4 -bet sequences with 1 2  or fewer wins is 7 .,295
12Xpert,"most of this will just be variance.
chance of 2 8 .6  %  from 4 3 9  bets avg odds 5 .0 1  = 0 .0 4  % 
chance of 6 .8  %  from 1 1 3 5  bets avg odds 2 .7 2  = 0 .8 2  % 
not a huge difference so whilst yield might be higher you can't infer that longer odds do better compared to expectation.",293
12Xpert,"i'm lost. if the book is 1 0 0  %  then the implied probabilities of all the horses must sum to 1 .
so i have a 2  horse race. i price it 0 .5 /0 .5  knowing that horse a will be hit by a meteorite and fail to finish. the true price is 0  and for b the true price is 1 . still sums to 1 .",288

12Xpert,say i bet 2 .1  and it closes at 2 .0  (after juice is removed). if the closing price is 'true' then my predicted roi is given by 2 .1 /2 .0  = 1 .0 5  or 1 0 5  %  (5  %  profit). if i make thousands of bets like this and i make a 5  %  profit this implies the closing prices were 'true' (on average).,302
12Xpert,you have 1 0 0 0 0  teams they all close at +1 0 0 . clvh tells you they should be efficient. but how do you know? say for all of those teams you were able to bet +1 1 0 . if the close was efficient for all your roi should be 5  % . if it is that tells you close was likely efficient.,284
12Xpert,think of it this way. suppose you had to throw 3 7  successful darts equivalent to 3 7  pots to make the 1 4 7 . 4  x 9  = 3 6  so that's 4  consecutive 9 -darters followed by a treble 2 0 . would a darts pro be more likely to do that than a snooker pro make a 1 4 7 ? no chance.,279
12Xpert,"what's your long term expected win percentage with these? if 5 3  %  then i estimate the current bad luck to be a 1  in 6  event
if 5 4  %  a 1  in 1 4  event
if 5 5  %  1  in 4 4
if 5 6  %  1  in 1 8 3

any thoughts?",241
12Xpert,"2 3 rd may 2 0 1 6  uk treasury published this:

its ""cautious"" forecasts predicted sterling falls 1 2  %  unemployed rises 5 2 0 0 0 0  wages fall 2 .8  %  house prices fall 1 0  % . in fact sterling fell 2 0  %  unemployed fell 2 9 0 0 0 0  wages rose 5 .1  %  house prices rose 7  % ",286
12Xpert,a though experiment. suppose bookie offers a market on a coin toss (they do in the form of odd/even e.g.). suppose it's random who bets what side so expected is 5 0 -5 0 . using binomial with odds of 1 .9 5 /1 .9 5  and 1 0 0  bettors there's a 3 8  %  chance bookie is exposed (5 2 /4 8  or worse).,299

a: opens 2 1 0  closes 2 0 5  game total = 2 0 0
b: opens 2 0 0  closes 2 0 5  game total = 2 1 0
when doing emh analysis we see average closing price = 2 0 5  and average game total = 2 0 5 . hence we see efficiency.
but hidden is the influence of anchoring.
thanks.",276
12Xpert,oh i don't doubt that but i think whilst 9 -darter would be something like 1  in a trillion (based on having thrown a couple of 1 8 0 s and i;m guessing i've probably thrown 3  darts about 1 0 0 0 0  times) me doing a 1 4 7  would be more like 1  in 1 0 ^2 4  based on my current ability.,288
12Xpert,think you know what a small sample is? imagine someone had said away wins in english pro football had been doing well in 2 0 1 4  so you decided to bet them in 2 0 1 5 . this is how you would have done with all 2 0 4 7  matches played in that year to  closing prices. +2 .8 3  % .,280
12Xpert,definitely ratio. imagine bookie probability of 0 .0 0 1  (odds = 1 0 0 0 ) and true probability of 0 .0 1  (odds = 1 0 0 ). difference is just 0 .0 0 9  (0 .9  % ) but your edge is 1 0 . edge correlates exactly with expected roi when betting level stakes. difference to my mind tells you nothing.,297
12Xpert,wisdom of crowd system performance for extra leagues. sample size of bets = 2 1 0 6 1  (since 2 0 1 2 /1 3 ). actual roi = 3 .6 8  %  expected roi = 6 .2 5  % . difference is p-value = 0 .0 3 . could this imply that  odds for these less liquid leagues are less efficient than the majors?,287
12Xpert,invert the division and then yes. in your example such bets would win 1 0  %  of the time but you would only get paid as if they were winning 1 4  %  of the time. so here your expected roi would be 1 0 /1 4  = 0 .7 1 . it's the pinny closing odds model that provides the best measure of truth.,293
12Xpert,nba has an outcome points variance of about 1 7 .5  about a bookmaker's line. 0 .5  point equates to about the size of the margin i.e. for example shifting the line from 2 0 0  to 1 9 9 .5  move 5 0  %  overs to 5 1 .1  %  overs.  it's not a lot is it. just can't see your hypothesis standing up.,296
12Xpert,"none of that implies what you're saying is valid.
""since 2 0 0 9  sportradar has recorded 4 1 4 5  sports matches as being manipulated.""
it monitors 3 0 0 0 0 0  sports events per year so let's say that's 2  million in 1 0  years.
4 1 4 5 /2 0 0 0 0 0 0  = 0 .2  % 
go figure.",276
12Xpert,"so with odds of 2 .0 0  you need about 5 5 0  bets to get under 1  % .
with odds of 5  you'd need about 2 1 5 0 .

-2  %  expected yield is the assumed bookmaker's margin. it might be worse i.e. -3  %  or -4  %  or worse depending on what odds you're betting and what bookmaker you're using.",291
12Xpert,sample was same as last week (5 4 6 1 5  odds from 1 8 2 0 5  matches). i do realise that i'm still kind of comparing oranges with lemons really we need either 5 3 8 's odds at closing or we need pinny's odds at the time 5 3 8  publish their predictions. but still it's of some value i think.,292
12Xpert,if they shade more they could increase the expected profit more. for example if the move to 4 8  %  xprofit = 3 .3  %  4 7  %  = 3 .7  %  4 6  %  = 4 .1  % . but there comes a point were punters will notice and the 6 0  %  backing it drops and probably drops considerably destroying expected profit.,299
12Xpert,"pick a random population of opening and losing odds. the average o/c ratio will be about 1 .0 0 0 . then picks samples from that population say 1 0 0  matches. see if you can pick a sample with an average o/c of 1 .0 5 0 .
but do that with results much easier to find roi = 1 0 5  % ",283
12Xpert,"how have you done the test? 1 .6 6  %  for nish seems really weak. i'd have expected much smaller than that. 8 .6  %  versus about -0 ..3  %  over 3 0 0 0  bets.

i've done a t-test using nish's actual profit/losses versus his expected profits/losses (3 1 9 4  bets) and get p = 0 .0 1 4 3  % .",294
12Xpert,(2 /2 ) your sample sizes are just too small meaning 7 /1 0  and 8 /1 0  are likely to contain a lot of luck. hence concluding a 7 5  %  chance for over is not likely to be a valid conclusion. if it was 7 0 /1 0 0  and 8 0 /1 0 0  then it would be more reliable.,262
12Xpert,...bettors are not coins. so i used a normally distributed random number generator to vary 5 7  %  using a standard deviation of 6  %  and counted the number of winners in 3 4  bets repeated 1 0 0 0 0  via a monte carlo. average minimum expected win  %  for a bet in 3 4  bets was about 4 4  % ...,297
12Xpert,preliminary investigations into performance of  soccer ratings against closing  1  times 2  betting market. sample 1 8 1 0 5  league matches from 1 2 /0 8 /1 6  to 1 0 /0 4 /1 9 . 5 3 8 's model finds 2 1 9 1 5  'value' bets. yield is -5 .9 5  %  (blind betting -4 .3 8  % ).,275
12Xpert,sorry nish these public bets are stupid. i know it's about getting skin in the game but as you know most of what happens in betting is luck. i'm not paying anyone for that. at average odds of 3 .3 4  a -2  %  ev betting system has a 3 4  %  chance of being in profit after 1 0 0 0  picks,287
12Xpert,"the gap between data mining and ""live play"" results is smaller for the subset of 4 2  ""pro"" strategies (6  of which are maxi's golden6 ) but only slightly so. data mining: 1 0 4 .3 3 9  picks positive yield of 1 1 5  % . follow up results: 1 2 .0 0 0  picks negative yield of 2 3  % .",284
12Xpert,"incredibly it's true just for draws (which i would always have thought are the hardest to predict) although the effect is not nearly as strong but still hugely significant.
o/c avg ratio of winning draws = 0 .9 9 7 9
o/c avg ratio of losing draws = 0 .9 9 2 9
t = 1 5 .6  p = 1 e-5 4",283
12Xpert,if you see a  $ 1 0 0  bill on the ground don't bother picking it up because it really had been it would have gone by now. if you don't believe in efficiency then the onus is on you to find a better explanation for why it might still be a real  $ 1 0 0  and everyone else has missed it.,286
12Xpert,here's the time series of betting overs to opening and closing lines where there is no margin (i.e. odds = +1 0 0  2 .0 0  or evens). as reported in my article there is a bias against the overs. but it's only weakly significant (1 -tailed t-test p = 0 .0 4 4  2 -tailed p = 0 .0 8 8 .,284
12Xpert,i don't think it really matters since it's a relative skills competition. like tennis. a 2 0 1 0  serena williams would probably beat a 1 9 6 0 s rod laver. but she'd have no hope against the 2 0 1 0  top 1 0 0  men. bettors might get better and better at predicting a line but the same  %  win.,295
12Xpert,luck. this calculator tells you the probability of things than can happen assuming there is no skill present. the precise figure from the calculator is 0 .9 9 9 9 9 1 7 7 7 9 3 1 8 6 1 . given that's almost 1 0 0  %  it would be reasonably to conclude that probably something other than luck is there.,301
12Xpert,1 0 8  1 4 7 s in competition but it looks about 5  years out of date. i'd guess it's nearer 2 0 0  now. 3 1 4  9 -darters in the history of the pdc (4 7  last year). but i'm guessing there are far more darts legs than snooker frames played in professional competition so 9 -darter would be harder,297
12Xpert,i didn't actual say what he has won in betting is down to luck. i would say that almost all of his outcomes reflect luck but his skill ever so slightly balances the good luck over the bad. variance in 1  bet  skill in 1  bet. variance over 1 0 0 0 0  bets  skill over 1 0 0 0 0  bets.,284
12Xpert,median is a better measure of what you should expect to see because the mean is skewed by a few very big banks. here's another the same as before but with stakes 5  %  instead of 2  % . you can see the dangers of betting more than kelly stakes. mean = 2 .7 1  but... median = 0 .7 8 .,284
12Xpert,well i suspect you're going to hurl more insults at me for this. i came up with a little model to vary expected win  %  for each bet. so say the long term expected figure is 5 7  % . i've been assuming every bet is 5 7  % . but now what happens if we vary this as you suggest because...,286
12Xpert,that would be unreasonably high. but remember for 1  times 2  there are three possible opportunities for an arb to arise so in fact the total number of possible opportunities was 3  x 5 0 2 1 0  matches = 1 5 0 6 3 0 . so 1 6 8 6 1  as a proportion is 1 1 .2  % .,263
12Xpert,"lessons in data mining: part 1
here's a wonderful little system i've found. back draws at  closing prices shorter than or equal to 3 .1 0 . since 2 0 1 2  betting main european league football you'd have made 1 0 4 .8  %  roi from 3 5 1 1  bets. p-value = 0 .0 0 0 6 . get in!",276
12Xpert,so in this graphic a bookmaker can shade a line from 5 0  %  win rate to 4 9  %  win rate (within the margin of 2 .5  % ) and if the 6 0  %  backing it (e.g. the favourite or the over) don't notice the shading the book's profit increases from 2 .5  %  theoretical to 2 .9  % .,276
12Xpert,"and to be clear even at this level the ""shading"" is only minimally more than the vig. my woc system found ev 2  %  at bet3 6 5  about 1 5 0 0  times since august 2 0 1 5  so perhaps only in about 5  %  of matches. if they were more generous they would have to ban considerably more customers.",292
12Xpert,cant believe people are going for hole in one. this is a one off luck event 1 2 5 0 0 -1  for the average golfer. 1 4 7  and 9 -darter is a much more complex outcome requiring huge skill to acquire. the number occurring even in professional sports must surely be fewer than 1  in 1 2 5 0 0,289
12Xpert,sadly it's going to be difficult for liverpool to overhaul the record of 1 0 2  since the first 5  games in the current 3 8 -game stretch were all 3 -pointers. they would need to win the next 6  in a row to ensure their loss to man city on 3 rd jan 2 0 1 9  drops out. unlikely.,278
12Xpert,he's still got an account because william hill expect him to hand it all back and more. in the end they expect the variance to kill him. here's just the second run of a simulation with 2 5 0  1 0 -bet parlays odds 2 0  each parlay with +2 0  %  xroi stakes  $ 1 0 0 0 0 .,271
12Xpert,"variable = expected bet win  % s are varied as explained.
fixed = expected bet win  % s are 5 7  %  for every bet.
as expected 1 2  or fewer wins occurs a bit less than 1  %  of the time (1  in 1 1 3  via binomial) for the fixed. but it's just about the same for the variable.",276
12Xpert,in fact if one had randomly bet once for every 1 0 1 8 0  matches (i.e. randomly picking home draw or away) with these closing odds you've have had a 3 .3 2  %  chance of making a profit. that would be 3 3 2  punters in 1 0 0 0 0 . many of them would think themselves sharp.,274
12Xpert,these 1 6 0 0 0 + bets maxi could i have seen them over the past 7  years and bet them or did you just trawl a load of historical data a few months ago until you found a draws system that delivered 1 0  %  roi? if you don't understand the difference then you need to go re-read taleb.,284
12Xpert,"you bet  $ 1 1 0  to win  $ 1 0 0  on both sides. 1  side wins. net loss = - $ 1 0 . turnover =  $ 2 2 0 .  %  loss = 4 .5 5  % 

bookmaker is laying  $ 1 0 0  to win  $ 1 1 0  on both sides. net profit = 5  % ",210
12Xpert,i'm told that because i place the emphasis at this end i ruin peoples dreams. i don't care. i'd rather ruin the dreams of say 1 0  %  of punters who might be put off trying by my negativity (of which 1  %  will make it) than encourage 9 0  %  to believe but see 9 9  %  of them fail.,283
12Xpert,in fact for odds with the margin removed the magnitude of an odds movement is equivalent either way. suppose 2 .0 0  and 2 .0 0  goes to 1 .5 0  and 3 .0 0 . the 1 .5 0  wins the 3 .0 0  loses. winner o/c = 1 .3 3 3  loser o/c = 0 .6 6 7 .,239
12Xpert,or to put it another way version 2 . if 7 0  %  of people back the favourite in a us spread market why do the bookies not bias against this 3 0  to 7 0 . why only 4 8  to 5 2  (if levitt is correct). what would happen if the bookies went to 3 0 -7 0 ?,251
12Xpert,so it's going to be next to impossible to do this. but i suppose to see if messi is an outlier we could stick to players who've scored in excess of 1 0 0  goals. he's on about 6 0 0  so if he's an outlier on a 1 0 0 + distribution then that would be even more ridiculous.,271
12Xpert,as dc has said a performance over 3 0 0 0  does not prove you are winning because of something other than luck. 1  in 2 5  punters betting odds of 4  at pinnacle will show a profit of more than 3  %  after 3 0 0 0  bets. those who write books think it's worth reminding people of this.,285
12Xpert,"depends on odds.
you can guestimate an answer with this:

put -2  %  in expected yield (cell f3 ).
put 8  %  in cell g1 0 .
cell g9  will tell you what the chance is of doing better than 8  %  if you have nothing.
you want this to be certainly less than 1  %  ideally 0 .1  % ",276
12Xpert,but it requires a really extreme distribution of xwin %  to make this happen. if i now randomise the order of those 3 9  %  and 6 4 .5  %  bets i get back to 1  again. so you will really need to come up with an explanation for why there can be long periods of way-below-average xwin % .,286
12Xpert,ok so finally i've managed to create what you see i.e. more 1 2  from 3 4  than binomial would predict. we just need a bigger sample of bets. this time i used 1 4 6  which gives 1 1 3  possible 3 4 -bet sequences. binomial would predict on average we'd see 1  with 1 2  or fewer wins.,284
12Xpert,"why beating the market in us horse racing is so hard:

a typical track ""take"" is 1 7 .5  %  meaning tracks take 1 7 .5  %  of total wagers before distributing funds to winners.

if sportsbooks had a similar ""take"" you would be laying -1 5 4  to win +1 0 0  on a point spread bet.
1 /",283
12Xpert,but energy my arse. they put up a graphic in the 5 th with the kj expended by both players. was about 5 5 0 0  kj. that's about what i would expend riding my bike at 3 0  thousand ph on the flat for 2  hours or what a uci pro in a race would expend in an hour.,260
12Xpert,it's a lot isn't it. but look at it another way. 1  in 1 0 0 0  bettors betting 2 .0 0  with best-in-market bookmakers will be able to show a 5  %  yield after 4 0 0 0  bets simply by chance. you must be clear that this calculator does not tell you the probability that you are skilled.,286
12Xpert,i suspect that once you have the skill the 1 4 7  is easier than the 9 -darter because for a highly skilled player variance (bad luck) would be a bigger factor in throwing darts than cue striking. but for idiots like me i'd be more likely to get lucky with a 9 -darter than a 1 4 7 .,283
12Xpert,"a useful read on the psychology and quantification of losing runs. however i think they've got their maths slightly wrong. 

""a service with a 4 9  %  strike-rate has a 5 0 /5 0  chance of hitting 1 0  losers on the bounce over a 6 5 0  bet period.""

i think it should be 8 5 0 .",279
12Xpert,"it's actually very hard to create skewed distributions where the average is still 0 .5 7  win  % . so i created a non random extreme one:
first 2 4  bets have exp win  %  of 6 4 .5  % 
last 1 0  bets have exp win  %  of 3 9  % 
this fulfils your longer left tail requirement.",275
12Xpert,..although the lowest was 3 1  % . average maximum win  %  for a bet in 3 4  bets was 7 0  %  although the highest was 8 4  % . here are the results tabulated by percentage of time in 1 0 0 0 0  runs the minimum number of wins was fewer than or equal to n.,256
12Xpert,i agree on reflection i thought it was too which is why i deleted it. however i still think all this moaning about a few selecting a new prime minister is at bit over the top. boris is a hypocrite for complaining about it in 2 0 0 7  as are labour now. this is how our system works,281
12Xpert,how did you get 2 9 ? it's 1  infects 2  not 1  infects 1 . it's clear cases and deaths are following a logarithmic not linear growth. anyway the true mortality rate will not be 2  % . i won't be 1  % . it will end up being nearer 0 .1  % . massive under-reporting of cases.,274
12Xpert,"2 7 4 0 1  ratios where opening price is between 1 .9 0   2 .1 0  (so close to 5 0 :5 0 ). 4 9  %  winners 5 1  %  losers.

average winner o/c ratio = 1 .0 0 7 7
average loser o/c ratio = 0 .9 9 3 2

p-value = 1 .4 e-4 8",220
12Xpert,"yes i can do that. although i suspect you'll see more movement at longer odds simply by virtue of the fact that 0 .2 5 /0 .2 0  is bigger than 0 .8 0 /0 .7 5 .
yes i'm assuming odds across the population movement are random. given the large noise to signal ratio i suppose that's fair.",285
12Xpert,levitt suggested that 4 8  %  of nfl spread favourites win and books were exploiting that. what if the books pushed the line so 4 7  %  were winning. then 4 6  %  and 4 5  % . at some point there would be a sudden change in the behaviour of bettors. a non linear response and potential liability,295
12Xpert,of course as i've pointed out it's probably not fair to compare messi to the others like this because he has so many more goals. if there was a large sample of players with 6 0 0  goals then the sd would be much smaller than this. so maybe he is a genius. intuition will say he is.,281
12Xpert,presumably at 7 8  (or 8 0  if they win the undeclared seat) it is. if it isn't then that would destroy the party. no deal is not wanted by the british people. brexit won 2  % . they didn't even get close to a million votes. if the erg still stand for that they have no mandate.,278
12Xpert,you have an average bet odds to closing odds ratio of 1 .0 1 0 7  in the 2 1 9 0  bets where you have closing odds. that's not enough to overcome their margin so you won't have +ev over the fair (margin removed) closing odds. if clvh is correct you don't hold long term expected profit.,286
12Xpert,friday to sunday's 5 7  woc matches showed a loss of -3 2 .9  %  compared to an expectation of +3 .8 7  % . monte carlo says only 3  %  of these will be worse. if anyone doubts the influence of short-term variance on real world outcomes here's the 1 0 0 -bet running average time series.,287
12Xpert,as for the economic pain of wto rules obviously hard brexit would hurt (for n years n unknown). but my point is that you don't have to be in the eu to get rid of tariffs. the uk can have no tariffs with all countries it trades with if it wants. it doesn't need the eu for that.,277
12Xpert,combining the records gives p-value = 0 .0 0 8 . but really we should apply a bonferroni correction so alpha = 0 .0 0 5  hence no significance. if we take alpha as 0 .0 5 /0 .0 2 5  then the significance is weak at best and still non existent for the spreads on their own.,272
12Xpert,actually this is nonsense. i'll give you my data set and you see if you can randomly subdivide the population into two samples with one sample exactly twice the size of the other and get anything close to these figures. i tried 1 0  times and got this (population avg = 0 .9 9 8 3 2 ).,285
12Xpert,thats not what i inferred. he said if i find clv so from that i took to mean he knows what his expected value is. then its a question of how long bad luck can go against you. if on the other hand the question is how long does it take to find clv answer is much less.,266
12Xpert,i would defend it regardless. i've always loved gambling ever since i played a kiddy fruit machine at a local fair when i was 1 4  and the prizes were 1 p 2 p and 3 p. for me it's about the thrill of outsmarting the opposition to win with wits as i admitted to in my book.,272
12Xpert,norwich winning at home had a big impact. that that out and the total homes is -2 4 .6 2 . wolves beating man city impacted the aways significantly (price 2 1 .9 4 ). in total 8  away wins with prices more than 8 . take those out and aways would be -4 5 .9 1,258
12Xpert,ok so would be useful to know what the standard deviation of the distribution is. if we assume average is 1 .0 0  then if the sd is 0 .0 5  messi would be a 4  sigma outlier. but if it's 0 .1  then no so unusual. problem will be that different players have different goals totals.,280
12Xpert,if a paper doesn't agree with his politics a free press is allowed to criticise them. if more papers than not don't agree with his politics that's not a reason to invent a conspiracy and claim foul play. the same press existed between 1 9 9 7  and 2 0 0 8 . blair did just fine.,278
12Xpert,indeed. the first mourinho chelsea was truly impressive points-wise. 2 1  consecutive games with a 3 8 -points total of 9 7  or more. liverpool are currently only at 1 7 . man city beat them both with 2 5  consecutive games at 9 8  or more and 1 3  consecutive with 1 0 0  or more.,281
12Xpert,so you have to increase the sample size to go looking for it. but at the other extreme with the whole population of odds everything is perfectly efficient e.g. average probability of 1  times 2  is 3 3 .3 3 3  %  and outcomes actually happen 3 3 .3 3 3  %  of the time (on average).,282
12Xpert,actually had my maths wrong. with a 5 0  %  win probability 1 2  from 3 4  or worse is 1  in 1 6 . with a 5 6  %  win probability (9  %  roi from 1 .9 5  odds) it would be 1  in 8 2 . so really no idea what you are doing here.,226
12Xpert,using poisson leads to a systematic underestimation of draw probabilities (average -2  %  max is -4  %  in the bundesliga) with p-value0 .0 0 1 . poisson can lead to very high px %  compared to odds but still boomakers estimate that in about 1 2  %  of matches px3 0  %  compared to poisson 6  % ,296
12Xpert,(2 /2 ). the unskilled bettor (-2  % ) finished with a bankroll higher than the skilled bettor (+2  % ) 2 6 .1 6  %  of the time. the unskilled bettor's best best bankroll 2 4 8 .4 4  beat 9 9 .1 5  %  of the 1 0 0 0 0  skilled bettor's finishing bankrolls.,257
12Xpert,"i simply chose a past date to look at. i could have chosen any but i chose february 2 0 1 5 . it was a random choice. i have no intention of doing this again to make this look better for your argument.
""on our main site""
so is this an admission you actually represent betrush?",276
12Xpert,you must have more than one link to different results then. i could have 1 0 0  links to 1 0 0  different sets of results and 2 5  of them would be better than the picture i just posted. i could should boom for those 2 5  and say nothing about the other 7 5 .,259
12Xpert,sorry to confuse you. no it's showing pinnacle's price as sharp and 5 3 8 's implied prices as erroneous. for example if pinny have 2  and 5 3 8  have 2 .2  your expected value is 2 .2 /2  = 1 0  % . over many matches you win about 1 0  %  profit over turnover.,261
12Xpert,"sorry i forgot you sent me the data. had a look now p-value = 0 .0 0 0 2 .
i still won't be convinced yet. there are other reasons why pinnacle might not be responding to you leaving aside arguments like they don't respond to sharps. you go via a broker maybe they don't know you.",280
12Xpert,but isn't that the problem? we don't know what the true single event probability is. an expected average of 5 0  %  from 2  events could see one winner one loser but we don't know if the true probability of those events wasn't 0  %  and 1 0 0  % . hence true objective measure is tricky.,287
12Xpert,yes indeed. but couldn't i say forget 5 3 8  look at pinny instead. ok they have to do a bit more maths to remove the margin. pinny could do that for us in fact they do although they don't do it properly for the public because they don't want to reveal how they really do it.,275
12Xpert,i just checked again. five big leagues 5 .2 2 3  matches from 1 2 -0 8 -1 6  to 0 9 -0 4 -1 9  with calculated probabilities from 5 3 8  and pinnacle closing odds from . value betting based on 5 3 8  probabilities would have produced a negative yield of 8 .3  % ,262
12Xpert,"same system now from december 2 0 1 5  to march 2 0 1 9 . 9 2 .8  %  roi from 2 2 3 4  bets p-value = don't be a schmuck and believe everything you see has a reason for being so. 
learn what regression to the mean is and don't  be fooled by randomness.",252
12Xpert,you're asking all wrong questions. it's not a question of the relative  %  of skill and luck. it's a question of how long does it take for skill to dominate. betting is a low validity environment. in 1  bet luck is almost all of it. in 1 0 0 0  bets it's still a lot of it.,273
12Xpert,oh i've noticed. but ireland is still the tax haven that it has been for a long time and no one has stopped them. eventually it will go like this: the eu gets tough and tells the irish what to do. they will either do it and fuck their economy or they won't and will face expulsion,280
12Xpert,"you're quite right so i apologise.
favourites average o/c = 1 .0 0 6 3 6
underdogs average o/c = 0 .9 9 3 4 0
t-test p-value = 1 .5 e-2 3 7

but isn't the explanation basically the same? favourites are opening on average nearly 1  %  too long and shorten. most winners are favourites.",284
12Xpert,i mean the other 5 0  % . if the winner to loser ratio was 1 :2  winners just wouldnt be able to win as much because the losers would stop playing. the 1 :1 0 0  ratio or smaller is just going to be the natural equilibrium of this kind of competition. its just like evolution.,276
12Xpert,"it might. it might also lead to job losses.

the problem with labour's tax policy is that it's at the mercy of high variance. 1  %  of the nation contributes 1 2 .5  %  of income tax. if just a few of those get annoyed the tax take is dramatically affected. then you need other sources.",286
12Xpert,"yeah i would too. 
the tipsters' book is basically a grind for two-thirds of it 2 5 0  stories of tipsters who are now almost all gone. you wouldn't have to read all of them just a few to get a flavour. the reason i put them all in was to avoid giving a biased view.",266
12Xpert,but think you understand small sample size and variance. here's what could have happened. i ran a monte carlo and got this out put on about the 3 5 th attempt. that would still be within the bounds of the model just rather unlucky. 9 0 0 0  bets and a loss from a winning system.,279
12Xpert,i'll briefly qualify this. if you toss coins in the financial markets you can expect to cover inflation and perhaps get an added 1  or 2  %  on top relative to a bank long term. if you toss coins in a sports market long term you can expect to lose your shirt house job and family.,280
12Xpert,much of uk news media is indeed gutter both tabloid and broadsheet but in a free country they have the right to print it and i have the right to call it gutter. the fact that someone might not like what they write is not a reason to say the law needs changing to stop it.,271
12Xpert,i don't doubt many of the benefits. is why i've always been a supporter of the idea. but you have to let people have a say in whether they want this. i don't think they do sufficiently. and if you do give them a say  they turn against you calling them stupid is not good enough,277
12Xpert,when you win a bet ask yourself if that happened because of luck or skill and how you could tell the difference. nate silver has shown that a skilled poker player could go two years with no profit because of bad luck. 5  %  from 1 9 4  results is going to tell you almost nothing.,280
12Xpert,i'm thinking of reducing the main leagues football data bookmakers for 1  times 2  odds to just two: bet3 6 5  and pinnacle. is there any reason why i shouldn't do this? in return i am thinking of adding bet3 6 5  and pinnacle o/u and asian odds (in addition to max/avg). would this be useful?,293
12Xpert,don't forget that if you have a million different things (for example a million tipsters) then one of them will be expected to show p-value = 0 .0 0 0 0 0 1 . that looks great on paper but it's simply just telling you your dice is rolling as it should and doing nothing else.,275
12Xpert,you might then well say that 4 0  %  of 6 0  %  turnout is hardly an endorsement by the uk public of the tory party. then change the voting system. when the uk was given a chance to start that process in may 2 0 1 1  it chose to leave things as they are.,254
12Xpert,depends on what his probability was of losing one week and that depends on how many bets he has each week and what the odds are. suppose its 7 5  % . 2 3  consecutive is 1 -in-1 0 0 0 . if thats the worst in 1 0 0 0  players then its hardly surprising.,252
12Xpert,this is when it's appropriate: . your follow up results (a posteriori) are -4 .5  %  from 2 2 7 7 2  bets and 1 5 3  systems. 9 1  of them are loss making the average t-score is -0 .3 2 ). your systems are regressing to the mean because they are based on nothing.,263
12Xpert,so running a monte carlo (1 0 0 0  iterations) gives emdd of 6 2 .4  (close to the calculated figure of 6 5 .3 5  that kostas quoted presumably from  's brilliant calculator). in those 1 0 0 0  iterations 6  had mdd above the actual quoted figure of 1 0 7 .7 1 .,262
12Xpert,"similar to...
a  $ 1 0 0  bill is lying on the ground. an economist walks past it. a friend asks: ""didn't you see the money there?"" the economist replies: ""i thought i saw something but i must've imagined it. if there had been  $ 1 0 0  on the ground someone would've picked it up.""",282
12Xpert,but based on figures reported amongst self isolating footballers and other confirmed cases of high profile people who make up a tiny tiny percentage of the population plus stories of people i know who had it but have not been counted i can make a guess which would be 1 0 0 0 0 0 +,281
12Xpert,generally they don't smoke drink have diabetes and other cardio vascular compromises. meanwhile fatalities from measles have risen over 5 0  %  during 2 0 1 6  to 2 0 1 8  to 1 4 0 0 0 0  mostly effecting children 5  who don't get a choice to be vaccinated if their parents are conspiracists.,292
12Xpert,specifically see my example output for distribution of possible banks using kelly odds 2 .0 0  ev 5  %  bets 1 0 0 0 . for full and half kelly compare the area under curve left of the origin line. much smaller for half kelly but median (position of curve peak on x axis) little changed,285
12Xpert,because one cigarette can cause harm to anyone who smoke it. and arguably it doesn't much work anyway. between 2 0 1 4  and 2 0 1 9  the uk smoking population fell about about 2  million. the number of people who used to smoke but now don't and instead vape stands at 1 .5  million.,282
12Xpert,"no i  don;t think so. i'll say it again just to be clear but i suspect you and everyone else who thinks i'm an idiot will either misunderstand me or misquote me:

""almost everyone is a long term loser in betting.""

if i could use font size 1 0 0  for the first word i would.",274
12Xpert,the figure of 4 7 0 0 0  online vip customers has been estimated from health survey participation rates. from these it is implied that 3 7 6 0  (or 8  % ) are problem gamblers. no research source for this data has been included in the report so we have to conclude it is internal.,280
12Xpert,"average yield colder = 0 .7 7  % 
average yield hotter = -2 .7 7  % 
average price colder = 3 .8 8
average price hotter = 3 .2 5

so it's possible a bit of the difference could still be due to residual favourite-longshot bias if the log method doesn't fully account for it.",273
12Xpert,"for example 1 0 0 0  bets of odds = 2 .0 0  ev = 2  %  and stakes = 2  %  will have a performance distribution looking like this.

mean bank growth = 1 .4 9  which is more than the median (centre of distribution) = 1 .2 2  because the distribution is lognormal.",261
12Xpert,"it's just not good enough to say ""i feel like i made my profits happen."" where luck is so prevalent and it can so easily account for the things you think you see and feel you have to have a way of proving you made it happen. that is what the scientific method is for.",267
12Xpert,"yes strange shit can happen like 8  wins in 3 4  as happened here in 1 0 0 0 0  runs. but if you keep seeing those things far more than binomial predicts it's far more probable that your model or your tipsters' models are fucked not the maths.

but thanks for making me think.",276
12Xpert,here's the latest woc performance still publishing in real time (august 2 0 1 5 ). 9 5 4 8  matches avg odds 3 .9 4  expected yield 4 .1 7  %  actual yield 3 .7 8  % . that's nicely within the bounds of standard error telling us system seems to be working well.,261
12Xpert,youre welcome to just look at your own performance and think i win so do my mates so that joe he must be full of shit. thats ok. ill carry on studying the population of players when im permitted to see the data and wait for other like minded people to tell me im wrong,268
12Xpert,i really don't know how we've got to this. this just began by observing one could have made a good profit backing all away wins in 2 0 1 5  in eng prem champ 1   2  with pinnacle closing prices and suggesting this illustrates how large a sample can be that can still fool punters.,280
12Xpert,i've been investing in financial markets for 1 5  years. my annualised rate of return has been 1 1  % . i've either been clever (by picking decent markets) or spectacularly lucky. there is not a hope in hell i could have done this in a sports market with the same amount of time devoted,286
12Xpert,hard to work out. guessing seasonal outlay is about 1 0 0 0 0  so about a 1 3  %  roi. judging by the odds (a lot of bets seem to be accas and goalscorers) this success is probably down to variance and recreational books offering loss leading odds which you'd get banned for exploiting.,286
12Xpert,we came out of last glacial period (colloquially known as ice ages) about 1 0 0 0 0  years ago. typically warmer interglacials last about 1 0 0 0 0  years compared to longer periods of cold. this natural periodicity is driven by orbital (milankovitch) cycles over 1 0 s/1 0 0 s thousands yrs.,292
12Xpert,if no government can be formed after 2  weeks then there's ge to find one. at which point all bets are off as to what happens. about the only thing i am fairly confident is that brexit won't happen unless the eu let it and they won't let it because it's too dangerous for them.,277
12Xpert,"that's one point of view. the alternative point of view is that ""up to 2 0 0 9  bookies gave away routine value in the place part of long term bets so that simply betting e/w accas during the season netted an easy 6 0 -8 0  %  profit with minimal risk"" is complete bollocks.",274

12Xpert,wocs reached new high last w/e. still overperforming. here's profit chart ranked by descending bet ev (highest first). lower ev bets have underperformed indeed 4 6 4 2  bets with ev 3 .5  %  made nothing. at avg. odds of 3 .1 7  for these 1 1  %  this happens randomly so still only unlucky,290
12Xpert,actually youre right the bet would be +ev for me and would therefore be rational but the point about refusing to pay someone who would claim proof on the back of a 3 4  %  chance of it happening by luck still stands. he needs to explain more why he thinks his systems are +ev,275
12Xpert,"i couldn't resist without seeing results in football so i created a kind of game

12Xpert,im not coaching on how to find value at pinnacle. im coaching on how hard it is to do that. the fact that you appear to manage it in table tennis does not change this truth and does not preclude me from coaching it. this is the point you and your buddy seem to miss.,266
12Xpert,im not really sure what your agenda is here with me. when i say the things i do about luck does it sow seeds of doubt in your mind that you might not have what it takes? or are you presenting yourself as some kind of saviour of the hopes and dreams of aspiring bettors...,271
12Xpert,it is certainly true that on my journey as a bettor i've discovered that i probably am a loser in the sense that i haven't (yet) been able to beat a sharp bookmaker. but i don't think there is any shame in that and then helping others understand how much is involved to achieve it,280
12Xpert,"but evidently within each implied win  %  winners show bigger o/c than losers. no example where the orange dot is bigger than the blue dot for that specific implied win  % .  no a single orange dot is 1 . most blue dots are 1 . so surely this must be the market ""knowing"" winners.",280
12Xpert,but for draws only even winning bets see price lengthening (on average) just not as much as losing bets which leads me to speculate the bookmaker plays with the draw more than h and a. from open to close the vig reduces a bit and it looks like most of that is on the draw.,272
12Xpert,or maybe its lazy traders just posting a disproportionate number of 1 .9 5 /1 .9 5 s and seeing what happens. i just think you read too much into this. given that nba totals are within 0 .5  point efficiency this says to me its just not possible to exploit squares much beyond margin.,284
12Xpert,if the claim that 1 1  times as many big spenders are addicts as compared to non big spenders can be verified then it would have some merit. but from this report it cant be since weve no proper idea of the methodology. its not a journal paper. its a set of powerpoint notes ffs,277
12Xpert,if twice as many people back -1 1 0  on the over as -1 1 0  on the under then to what prices would you have to move to try to get 5 0 -5 0  action and if you then did that what would happen to the action? the response will not be linear.,237

12Xpert,ok thanks. time will tell as it always does with these things. there's a chance i (and lucky) are wrong. i hope i am because i don't like to see people get stung badly from misplaced hope. and if i miss out on a good thing because of my poor judgement that's ok with me.,270
12Xpert,"i bet and am not addicted to betting. less that 1  %  are. many more people are addicted to food. they eat too much and can't stop it. the damage costs billions.

12Xpert,pinnacle closing. remember when you use level stakes you won't necessary get things summing to zero (or to the equivalent of the margin). in fact had you bet either all home or aways so far both would be in profit 0 .2 1  and 3 7 .9  respectively. draws are -8 .6 1 .,267

12Xpert,but here's the problem. i collect a load of tipsters who say they are sharp. we study them and they end up with a mean of 0  % . i say so much for being sharp they are just more coin tossers. and you say they obvious weren't sharp so your results are void.,256
12Xpert,i spent 1 4  years verifying tipsters. 1 2 0  of them came to me with previous records many of those had been published elsewhere with other services like blogabet or bettingadvice. in aggregate they had done 1 7  %  from 2 4  thousand  tips. their next 9 0  thousand  did 1  % .,279
12Xpert,and if you want to talk about pyckio here's this year's performance from the pros. 1 .4  %  from 6 2 4 1  tips january to september. that's pre fees and slippage. regardless it's whole lot less that their previous work. no idea which pros have come in and gone out in that time.,278
12Xpert,of course highly unlikely that wh would have keep the data for such bets going back years less still want to do the job if they had. hence the honourable thing to do would be to honour the error by paying out. the publicity gained would more than make up for their tiny loss.,275
12Xpert,the hardest thing for a bettor to deal with is understanding they live on the green line not the red and how they adjust their psychology to deal with that. remember these are 1 0 0 -bet samples so not insignificant. you will still see significant variance over 1 0 0 0 -bet samples.,283
12Xpert,i can check although could be a little tricky since i don't have a measure of what a 'big' team is. do you have one? obviously i would expect this sort of data mining to be completely meaningless and on the off chance it returns a profit will be because of small sample size.,275
12Xpert,i didn't say he was. he bets for a living or claims to. hence people lose money to facilitate that. you can bash affiliates or anyone else for being less moral (not sure why they are) but the fact remains that pro bettors can't do what they do if people don't bet and lose.,273
12Xpert,not really im asking people to show a bit of fairness and common sense. a majority voted to leave. parliament voted to trigger article 5 0 . that set a 2  year process in motion which was such that if a deal could not be agreed then the uk would leave with no deal.,265
12Xpert,and a good place to start is to wonder why humans like to take risks and make predictions about the future? which i hope is what i did in my book. simply closing off debate because we take a moral objection to something is not effective imo. surely the war on drugs confirms this.,280
12Xpert,fair enough. when you have a 1  in a gazillion record that can be verified then come back to me assuming you want me an others to know it's possible. in the meantime i'd suggest you keep the fact that you have such a skill set to yourself so you don't lose that advantage.,272
12Xpert,referring to your own record only is not sufficient to disprove emh. the probability that its something specific about what you do is greater than the probability that the emh is systematically invalid. if you can find 1 0 0 s/1 0 0 0 s others showing the same as you then that changes.,286
12Xpert,"so i then ask if sports betting is different because it's not quite random and allows for prediction models to compete and the possibility of skilled profit how can you be sure that yours is better than others and you say ""look at my profits."" so you have told us nothing (2 /2 )",279
12Xpert,given that the tips are with soft books its likely a lot of them will shorten if his system is genuinely +ev. easy to show but hes insisted i should do it implying he cant be bothered. why should anyone pay for tips from such a lazy arse? oh yeah coz he makes profit.,267
12Xpert,still making silly noises every time a tip wins? what sound when you lose? i could beat your record just guessing 1  in every 4  times. the second number seems to be getting lower. the first time i heard you breaking the sound barrier it was 1 1  then 9  now 4 . hmmmm.,269
12Xpert,"expected roi of a bet is actual bookmaker odds / true odds.
e.g. bookie odds = 2 .1  true odds = 2  expected roi = 1 .0 5  or 1 0 5  %  or 5  %  value.
true odds is given by pinnacle's odds with their margin removed.
all is explained in the pdf:",245
12Xpert,wawrinka won three and when he plays he really plays. zverev has zero mental toughness he was 2  points from taking the first set playing some really good tennis and then fell off a cliff. useless. how he ever got to 3 rd in the world is beyond me. big regression on the way.,275
12Xpert,yes i could. or alternatively i could say looking at it cynically that the stars group had asked them to get rid of it as part of a cost saving exercise to secure the deal and used the bad press about tipster affiliates as a means of doing it. their competitors said as much.,275
12Xpert,that's not something i can help you with. i don't profess to be able to beat the sharpest of players and that is whom i would be competing against when betting at pinnacle. i can only tell you that it takes a lot of hard work to be a winner at a sharp book.,257
12Xpert,"not as smart as you at obviously.
brad i will do same analysis with opening prices when i get a chance. i agree with your point it's going to hard to beat closing prices with less information but i'm then making the point that there's then not a lot of point to such ratings.",275
12Xpert,"sbc's recommendation is that if 1 ) a bookmaker offers you no protection and 2 ) if you are not betting with them right now - then withdraw the money you hold in these accounts.

you can deposit it back later if and when things return to normal. 

it's simply not worth the risk!",279
12Xpert,"don't you understand it's the word ""winning"" used in the context of ""strategy"" that's the problem . if you're going to use it then say"" you can only win through luck and in the end luck will run out and you can expect to lose an equivalent to the size of the house edge.""",271
12Xpert,because betting is fun even if you dont have ev. tennis is fun even though i would tell everyone that they have about 0 .0 0 0 0 1  %  chance of being better than roger federer. im just telling the truth hopefully to help some people not do silly things with their money.,271
12Xpert,"the only person who showed up with the ruler whenever it was you first showed up is you.

5  %  on tennis is incredible. you can make a living from it provided you have the volume of tips and stakes to go with that. if you don't... well you know the rest by now....",265
12Xpert,i build my conclusion on data analysis so when someone comes to me and says you are a loser or you have no idea what you'r talking about or you'r all wrong about tipsters i'm going to ask the how they know that. and that means they have to show me their data analysis.,268
12Xpert,no idea voy. that's what they accused you of. sue them if you don't like it. i can't ask them because they don't offer a contact unless you have an account which i don't. i could ask on their twitter pages. what do you think should i? or will they just die of boredom?,268
12Xpert,hold on a minute i think its fair to say that whilst there may be an element of skill in taking and saving penalties the noise in outcomes is much greater than the signal. hence a one off shoot out largely reflects luck in just the same way the outcome of a bet does.,267
12Xpert,yeah that's fine. if people who say they're not helpful give that as a reason i'm good with that. i would of course point out that this wasn't ever my intention so a) i'm sorry if i've mislead anyone in that respect and b) it's already been pointed out i'd never give you those,277
12Xpert,in fact i will price a at 0 .9  and b at 0 .1  to trick all my customers who don't know what's coming from the heavens. being a stupid biased lot they all back a. i win massively. but all the probabilities still sum to 1 . but this is all just silly.,250
12Xpert,so what? he might be a decent chap because of that but that has nothing to do with this issue. how can you argue that you want to take power away from westminster when you spend 3  years trying to assert the power of westminster over the power of the people? that's the joke.,275
12Xpert,2  questions here. if the answer to q1  is no i can't assure you that in 1 0  years ai won't leave pro betting markets impossibly efficient to beat (which is what you'd expect with this kind of arms race) then the answer to q2  is your initial bank growth will depend on luck.,276
12Xpert,when we talk about cognitive bias we do so as if people are really really dumb. they are not. just a little bit. if things are too obvious they get exploited away. more than the vig and too many would start to notice. i'd notice and i'm pretty dumb when it comes to betting.,274
12Xpert,could you also announce that  have beaten the record for the most points in 2 1  games (6 1 ) and the most points from the last 3 8  consecutive games (1 0 4 ). i love reading the triggered comebacks from disillusioned united fans about the numbers 1 3  and 2 0 .,263
12Xpert,as i don't have a sky tv subscription anymore i have to pay now tv to watch it or go to the pub and buy drinks or food there instead. the main reason it is being attacked and why you are puzzled why i defend it is because of an anachronistic moral viewpoint (imo).,264
12Xpert,but to buy panini stickers you have to pay the shop keeper as well as panini it's just that it's all rolled into one price. they don't need to make you buy something else. to watch a game you're paying both the fa and the bookmaker. the only difference is due to moral attitudes,278
12Xpert,i would be hugely surprised. poker is a game of relative skill. best bluffer takes all. here's a ranked plot of net losses faced by a sample of 3 4 4 5  bwin poker players (dataset discussed in my last book). 1 1 .1  %  were profitable obviously the majority of those were lucky.,279
12Xpert,"well perhaps we are arguing over what ""vip"" means. would you agree most of the turnover comes from a much smaller percentage of players? i would ask you to show data but i'd guess you wouldn't have access to that anymore and even if you did would not do so for commercial reasons",279
12Xpert,indeed. we know what city can do up front. liverpool can do the same. but city no longer have kompany. has made a big difference. liverpool have vvd. yes city have de bruyne a genius but liverpool have wing backs robertson and aa whose stats puts 9 5  %  of forwards to shame,275
12Xpert,"2 0 1 9  mega betting thread 

what ive learned about betting in 2 0 1 9

i thought i would update my 2 0 1 8  betting thread as there has been much to still learn  assimilate new people  resources to follow  i want to continue paying it forward to help others.",261
12Xpert,"indeed i'm looking forward to his answer. what i actually ""proved"" was that some markets aren't completely efficient but that's a long way from implying anyone can do +8  %  when the clv = 0  % . you may be a special case and if so we're still trying to find out why.",267
12Xpert,thanks. average 1 .1 6 6 . on that data alone that's a strong case for saying there are some players for which usual xg rules don't apply. arguably there should be an extra weighting applied to their xg to account for their finishing ability. obviously hard to know when to apply it.,283
12Xpert,great article and thanks for all the stats. it would still be useful to know what the standard deviation is to be able to say just how far off the charts he is but i guess that's practically impossible because every player has a different goal total so a different sd would apply,279
12Xpert,"it could be but i've no idea how the record was put together. if it was ""here's my hypothesis i will now test it with data"" then no it isn't. on the other hand if it was ""here's some data i will trawl it until i find something profitable"" then yes it is.",254
12Xpert,this time there are at least two teams possibly three who haven't been declared missing in action. if they win it from here it would arguably be far far greater an achievement than 2 0 1 5 /1 6  since it will like need 1 0 0  points to achieve not 8 1,251
12Xpert,i calculate a 9 .2 6  %  yield from 3 4 6 7  bets avg odds 4 .3 9 . p-value is 0 .0 5  relative to an expectation of -1  %  (rough estimate based on your clv). bayes factor is 1 6 0 . they're strong signs that clvh isn't correct here.,234
12Xpert,it's possible. however in the end the bookmaker is going to see you and want to know what you are doing that is better than them. they employ clever people to figure that out and then your information you bring will move the market. or more likely they won't offer you the value,278
12Xpert,whilst leicester were in just the right place at the right time (when the big 6  went on leave) ipswich can consider themselves unlucky. they spent two seasons with a lowest total of 3 6  and an average of 5 2 .3 8 . that would normally be enough to keep them up.,263
12Xpert,also interesting that leicester managed to pull off a premier league title with just a max consecutive 3 8 -game total of 8 3  points whilst liverpool on 1 0 1  have yet to get one (this season maybe). leeds and newcastle on 8 1  and 7 8  might also consider themselves unlucky.,278
12Xpert,"just to cut off arguments that this is a useless methodology that can only be used at soft books who will ban you i have been completely up front that it only works at soft books and that to sustain it you will need to find ""ways"" to sustain your soft book accounts.",266
12Xpert,because i don't have any data to study it. my general view is that the bookies do better out of it it's harder for the average punter to succeed at it than pre-match and that is why it's been pushed so heavily by bookies and now well over half of bets are in-play.,264
12Xpert,i think the ifs have been very balanced in their position in the two main party manifestos. on labour they have said their are saying it's wrong to imply only the rich will have to pay. on the conservatives they have said it is wrong to imply no one will have to pay.,267
12Xpert,"that bettor now has 1 4 0 0 0  records and has regressed back to closer numbers as expected.

2 .5 5  actual
2 .0 7  expected

that expected could be cloudy without the bettor actually known the true margin on all bets and ""getting close"" to the actual margin for calculating expected",284
12Xpert,or you could assume it's about 0  %  if you are targeting best in market prices. but if you do that with recreational bookmakers (all uk and europe apart from exchanges) then they'll ban you for doing that. they'll also ban you if they think you really have +8  %  advantage over them.,285
12Xpert,i don't have the data to carry out such an analysis. i would also expect that others with access to far more data than i could ever gain access to and with far more sophisticated mathematical skills than me will have already done it and are in the process of exploiting it away.,278
12Xpert,yes that's my job and i've done it. i've showed that the performances of large collections of tipsters appear to be little different to random performances. i would love to be able to study a subset of so-called sharps and see if their mean was deviated to the right by 7  % .,276
12Xpert,people with 1 4 8  iq were lucky to be born with genes predisposing them to be able to pass iq tests or lucky to have a favourable upbringing that encouraged the sorts of things that allowed them to do well in iq tests. in the end perhaps everything reduces to quantum probability.,281
12Xpert,it's indirect confirmation bettors move markets when they see value prices. whether you should bet with bet3 6 5  or pinnacle depends on who you are. if you're sharp at pinnacle then use them. if not bet3 6 5  will offer you value until they decide they don't want to offer it anymore.,285
12Xpert,it's just never going to happen in a domestic league. barcelona were 4 .5 8  v celta. they'd just won la liga and were about to play liverpool so meaningless and they lost. real madrid were 3 .6 9  away against barca they lost. juve 3 .1 4  away v napoli. they won.,265
12Xpert,"but his account of why he did what he did would be his point of view. i imagine in addition to solving the ""tory bastards"" and farage problem he would probably also argue that it was reasonable to put the question to the public after such a long period since the last time...",275
12Xpert,you work for opta right? there are those who would argue you're a corporate slave owned to make profits for the few in this case perform group with revenues of half a billion and profits of close to 1 0 0  million. personally i think that would a silly position as is yours.,274
12Xpert,but if that's how they see it then at least give europeans a chance to decide if they agree. .currently they don't (almost no countries hold referendum with each new eu treaty) and when they do and get it wrong they are told to go away and get it right the next time.,267
12Xpert,it's a good read and on the money with the science but it's another example of a piece quoting a low percentage of affected people in comparison to over eating and problem eaters and we don't seem to attach the same level of moral outrage to that behaviour. i'd like to know why.,279
12Xpert,my views on gambling are espoused in my last book. rather than simply treating it as a moral bad i've tried to look at why humans do it why it's as natural as a belief in god and how thinking about uncertainty through the lens of gambling can make us better decision makers.,274
12Xpert,0 -0  after extra time the uk would have to keep retaking its penalties every time the score one on the grounds that they hadn't scored it the right way so had to do it again until they missed and then it was the right way. final score 3 -0  to the eu.,252
12Xpert,that's why they were top class with you. it's a lesson punters should learn. if a soft book doesn't restrict you and you are doing nothing to disguise your activity then this implies they think you are an idiot and a cash machine for them. that's fine if betting is just for fun.,279
12Xpert,i'm not saying his prediction model is wrong. it might work. but he's no idea if it does and argues that the only way to say it does is to look at profits. that is bad statistical thinking and if he doesn't know why he's clueless and if he does then he's deceiving,264
12Xpert,when will people understand that we do not operate a presidential election system in the uk. our prime minister is simply the head of a government that has been formed by the party that won the most seats in our first past the post election system. we do not vote for a pm.,273
12Xpert,no company will say they're not required to by law. given probably over 9 0  %  of recreational bookie customers will not know how to break even long term it stands to reason that the easiest business model is to limit those who are. there'll always be more mugs to take their place,282
12Xpert,i put it out for others. i've long since been restricted by the vast majority of books. i could find ways to make it work but it's just not worth my while since i earn my main revenue from affiliation. perhaps one day when that stops i will have to make more effort.,266
12Xpert,yes you were missing something. i used my yield distribution calculator rather than my p-value calculator. the later is programmed to compare roi to break even (roi - 1 0 0  % ). in the former i set it to the blind betting returns which from memory was around 9 7 .5  % ,270
12Xpert,yes it was arbitrary. that's the point. but don't take my word for it. look at the 1 5 3  follow-up betaminic samples that will tell you all you need to know about what's happening here. if you end up profitable well done you've been lucky. don't kid yourself it was anything else,280
12Xpert,if the test to positive test rate ratio is assumed that would still put the true cases in the uk in the high tens of thousands imo. but that ratio is no longer meaningful so i'd imagine the true number is already in the 1 0 0 0 0 0 s (possibly higher).,252
12Xpert,but i'm actually not ruining any dreams at all. if you actually bother to read the things i've written then you will see that i simply say it's possible but you'll have to work damn hard at it and for those not willing betting is more than just about money anyway it's fun.,273
12Xpert,"why would believe them if they are asking for money for their advice but won't even follow their own advice?

however i can see a case where the tipster might be trying to do good deeds not betting their own picks and hence not causing the prices to drop. but is that credible?",277
12Xpert,i've tried to e-mail them but their contact page is so shit that they don't even have a visible send button. you think i'm going to pay any attention to someone lecturing me about limits/limitation who tips table tennis at a book no one has heard of  get less traffic than i do?,278
12Xpert,"i suppose that's a good analogy. and there are some who just think they can be ""formula 1  world champions"" and then get annoyed at others who have never been and will never be world champions when they tell them it takes a lot of talent hard work and knowledge to get there.",275
12Xpert,"the exercise was framed as equal stakes. obviously hypothetical. said nothing about smaller stakes for longer odds.
but lets make it more real. given the median staker stakes around  $ 5 0  and the 9 5 th  percentile staker stakes around  $ 1 0 0 0  for how many do these limits apply?",285
12Xpert,"you just pluck numbers out of the air like they mean something. they dont. you just make stuff up to suit your belief. no data at all

i show that tipsters normally distribute. you then tell me they arent real tipsters. so i ask you to show me real tipsters. im still waiting.",276
12Xpert,there are far too many charlatans in this industry who sell betting to win as easy. it's this sort of message that will lead to problem gambling. i want to prevent more of that. recreational betting is fun and the challenge of using your mind to make it something more is fun too,279
12Xpert,mark i just tell it how i see it. betting is a hard game to win so i feel it's right to give people this message. hopefully it will help more people who might believe they have an expectation to win from becoming problem gamblers and keep their betting as for fun only.,269
12Xpert,and on average or rather i should say almost always bettors aren't clever enough to find them systematically. i know i get slated for saying it but it's far more likely i'm right about it than all these young males who tell me i'm wrong are not in the least bit over confident.,277
12Xpert,i do apply a 2  %  buffer i.e. dont include value 2  %  but this is applied for all odds. the uncertainty in true odds will be greater the longer the odds which would make a case for increasing that buffer as odds lengthen. but then explaining this to users gets more complicated.,280
12Xpert,the reason i keep the pre-closing odds for the main leagues is really down to historical legacy. i've been collecting pre-closing odds since 2 0 0 1 . i only started adding closing odds a few years ago. i didn't want to be too disruptive so didn't get rid of the pre-closing odds.,280
12Xpert,i'll say it again. i'm too old and risk averse to care whether i do well out of a new idea that doesn't interest or motivate me. if you all become millionaires through fi well done you. i have other things in life i care more about. if i miss out that's fine.,259
12Xpert,you'll find i've already been clear in saying that fi is not actually a ponzi since that would mean it is fraudulent which it plainly isn't. but i will still continue to describe it as a 'castle in the air' built on sentiment and not fundamentals and that is why i won't invest.,278
12Xpert,try to imagine his life. i mean really try. not just the money but the intrusion every day all the time. and that in his mind the thought that this world killed his mother. try to imagine if youd want that or be happy living such life. i mean really try to imagine.,265
12Xpert,he had another strong woman in his life growing up but the filth that phone hacking rags like this one print was instrumental in her death. for all his errors his primary motivation is now to protect the other strong woman in his life today whom he loves from that sort of shit.,278
12Xpert,still cheaper than a sky sports tv subscription. is it worse than forcing someone who can't afford one of those to buy it to watch football on tv getting into debt and the rest of it? what's the ratio of people getting into debt by gambling v's getting into debt buying sky tv?,277
12Xpert,the former simply amounts to paying a fee as i now have to do to now tv. it is a guaranteed loss and there is not gamble. others will argue that there exists the opportunity to gamble and get addicted. but if you don't want to be addicted simply apply a self limitation.,270
12Xpert,presumably you'll reply with some stuff about how there is downside for you but not for me. try setting up an affiliate business and see if there is no downside. then also consider that you pay no tax on your winnings (well not in the uk at least) whereas i pay huge tax.,271
12Xpert,"i didn't say i didn't favour it either. i'm thinking out loud. 

you still haven't explained what's wrong with it.

what's the difference between having to pay 8 .9 9  to now tv to watch a premiership game and paying 5  for a bet which i might win and get my money back?",270
12Xpert,a large addiction industry? it's less than 1  % . you might say that 0 .0 0 1  %  is too big a price. but then say it for everything else that can be individually and socially harmful like driving and eating. what is it about gambling that makes it an easy target?,264
12Xpert,for sure you get regressions like this. but if hes moving lines and nothing else has changed hell still move lines when results are poor. compare the odds he advises against the closing odds. a sample of 1 0 0  should do it. calculate the ratio for each pair and then average.,276
12Xpert,tell me what stat has predictive value then? last 6  games? last 3 8  games? the fact that man city don't have kompany anymore? the fact that guardioloa has consistently failed to beat the best teams in europe if he doesn't have messi in his? bookies pay city too much respect now.,281
12Xpert,"what ""should be"" morally is frequently not what ""should be"" legally. i think we all agree it doesn't ""seem fair"" but there is a long historical and legal context to this. perhaps the law needs changing but that would be a big deal for contract law in the uk with many consequences",280
12Xpert,"it critical for a healthy uk democracy which has been absent since 2 0 1 5 . and it's always about ""the economy stupid."" to achieve liberal progressive green goals you have to credibly show how you will pay for them and bring everyone with you who will be asked to contribute.",276
12Xpert,a well known example is over/under markets. 6 0  %  of bettors typically bet on the over. whilst that doesn't imply that also means 6 0  %  of the turnover it's likely that it won't be 5 0 -5 0 . hence if bookmakers just balanced action they would offer incorrect prices.,271
12Xpert,"if i insult you it's because you come here looking for trouble. so why don't you just fuck off forever if that's all you've got to offer unless you have something useful to say like ""here is the place where mr. buchdahl said betting is all just chance"" and post a link.",269
12Xpert,if you've got something to say say it but think it through first before deleting posts. i'm not defending katie hopkins. as the son of an immigrant i'd be the last person to do that. i'm simply suggesting we don't apply her standards when judging her. it may not be her fault.,276
12Xpert,i can assure you that tipsters this side of the pond are just as useless. perhaps the only difference is that a greater proportion in the us know they are useless and cheat whilst in the eu many are still deluded into believing they have the slightest idea what they are doing.,277
12Xpert,"so you are left to simply take them on trust. many a fortune has been lost putting faith in people like these.

if you don't know how you made your profits you will have no idea what to do when those profits stop. i'm afraid betting is about numbers not drawing pictures.",271
12Xpert,think about it. why do 2  people engage in a contract. 1  buying. 1  selling. the both can't be right about the price. if there is commission involved likely both will be wrong. but the still do it. why? are the irrational? financially yes. but they play to play not to win.,274
12Xpert,yes it's possible i agree but i would think far less likely than the explanation that you don't have 5 7  % . without seeing your exact record this is basically all conjecture. and the trouble is so often people insist on things but never actually show me exactly what has happened,281
12Xpert,(1 /2 ) whilst we're on the topic of luck and skill i've ran a little monte carlo sim comparing two bettors betting even-money 1 0 0 0  times with 1  %  stakes (1 /2  kelly). first has margin expectation of -2  %  the second has skill expectation of +2  % .,257
12Xpert,"no it's not 5 0 /5 0  as i've explained in my book and articles but evidently you are either too stupid to understand anything that i say or too determined just to troll endlessly on this feed and interpret me as ""betting = exactly coin tossing"" for your own self gratification.",278
12Xpert,this is about testing for consistency. full regression to the mean implies pure luck none implies pure skill. heres what i did in the book 2 4 9  tipsters with records 1 0 0 0  tips. split into first half v second half. the almost no correlation implies almost full mean regression.,282
12Xpert,thinking about this a little more it strikes me that this provides another example of why focusing on actual outcomes rather than expectation is flawed. for example suppose a bettor has 1 0 0  even-money 1 -unit bets. 5 1  win. profit is +2 . all of it comes from 2  bets.,272
12Xpert,"""sorry about this joseph. we wouldn't be able to deal with that here at all. your best to get in touch with them directly i know you said they arent replying to your messages but it wouldn't be anything we would have control over here at ladbrokes.""
still not fit for purpose.",276
12Xpert,you could but it's not worth my while given i don't charge and i'm guessing you believe the data to need many corrections. i think it would be simpler for you provide your own service. i'm sure you are technically more able than i am. i'm sure users would be most appreciative.,277
12Xpert,"here we go again. the words 'monopoly' and ""footballdataco' (please that is not me) seem to go hand in hand. in 2 0 0 4  the ecj ruled against them copyrighting fixture lists. this will end up back there. i suspect they are quite keen for boris to get brexit done beforehand.",275
12Xpert,yes that's likely but we are still left with a 6  %  difference which is much bigger than their margin. i don't believe sharp books are in the habit of letting such profitable biases persist too long. they will want to figure out what the sharp punters are doing to beat them.,276
12Xpert,on the other hand if you're a coin flipper with no skill an a long term expectation of say -5  %  (unlikely to be this bad if you're using soft books and best market prices) then things look like this. 1  in 5  chance you could have done better than you did.,258
12Xpert,at current tip rate you won't get answers for years. if you want to make a career out of betting you need answers about skill a lot sooner than this hence bet volume is crucial.  people are welcome to deny this most do. that's ok. they are't professional bettors never will be,276
12Xpert,"what does boom! mean then? ""shit look how lucky i've been""?

also your numbers on bk don't add up. it says 2 6 3  tips but the monthly totals add up to 1 9 3  for a loss of -7 4 .3  not a profit of 4 4 .6 . how come?",216
12Xpert,"""the proof of whether it works or not is in the profit.""

don't follow tipsters like this. this single quote exposes how little they understand. if you don't understand why take the trouble to find out and if you can't be bothered give up betting unless you do it just for fun.",277
12Xpert,we don't play to win we play to play. and we do that because we crave control. things that give a sense of control even if illusory (like predicting how dice will land or belief in god) are beneficial to an ego engaged in evolutionary self preservation. have you read mu book?,276
12Xpert,look at his voting record on the eu. hes with tony benn who was staunchly anti eu. he wants brexit which is why he refuses a second referendum. when a vote of no confidence in the government is passed in october it will be interesting to see whether hell compromise on that.,274
12Xpert,"you put far too much faith in ""experts"" when the system we are dealing with - politics - has been shown to be close to a zero validity environment. besides if people fail to take the time to educate themselves and then subsequently make a mistake they won't do it next time.",274
12Xpert,you think working class folk in the valleys who don't see the eu money spent there doing anything for them who have voted labour all their lives and were decimated by thatcher in the '8 0 s are motivated to achieve lower taxes for the rich and less regulation for big business?,277
12Xpert,i could be a tipster using soft book. i've shown everyone how to do it. it's easy. hence it should be free. hence tipsters who charge should be selling something that isn't easy and hardly anyone can do. soft books are for recreational players. they are welcome to use my data too,280
12Xpert,it's somewhat starting to trouble me that references to old white people deciding the future prime minister of the uk is a classic 'ism that would be called out in any other context. not that i'm saying this was the point of these data but i thought it important to draw attention,280
12Xpert,no apology required its a fun discussion. youre basically right i just like the idea that its silly that more than half of people can think they are above average in ability at something. obviously we could have 9 9  who are just above avg. offset by one who is truly awful.,274
12Xpert,i agree that is what they should be doing. soft books are not a place where winning punters should be betting. but the majority of winning punters know that anyway. what they don't seem to realise is if soft books were actually trying to beat them they might not be as successful!,280
12Xpert,but to be a proper fan you can't ignore infinity. to be a proper fan you would be happy to bet your whole life against liverpool winning. they lose you double your life's worth (if this is an even-money wager); they win you lose everything but have the pleasure of their win.,275
12Xpert,really bottom line for me now is that whatever anyone tries to do here to make this sector of the gambling industry a better place for people there will always be some looking to exploit and others stupid enough to be exploited so not sure doing a new project will add anything.,278
12Xpert,"and by the way i already do. but not 1 3 1  picks over 8 0 0 0  of them and i give the methodology away for free. 
of course you'll probably get banned by uk bookies for using it as you will for using yours assuming they think you're a winner.",243
12Xpert,i don't care about knowing i'm just saying if you can do this you should get on with it quietly don't bother telling anyone else about it that increases the chances people find out how you're doing it and then make it less likely you can carry on doing it as well.,264
12Xpert,this question is only relevant if the closing line value hypotheses (that it's a good predictor of profit) is correct. many disagree with it. anyway i tried to answer it with this. for a margin of about 2 .5  %  i cam up with a figure of about 7 0  % .,252
12Xpert,thanks. yes i can be bothered. i've found the 2 0 1 6 /1 7  and 2 0 1 7 /1 8  seasons. that should be sufficient. will take a bit of time to match up with my pinny closing prices. still better than standing on a platform at crewe eh jez?,237
12Xpert,so let's be clear. a 1 -in-2 0 0 0  system was actually nonsense. of course if you 2 0 0 0  systems one of them will be this good just by chance but the point is that it won't stay being this good. it is all luck and luck regresses fully.,238
12Xpert,if you didn't care about feeding my ego you shouldn't have bothered turning up in my thread about closing prices with data that proves nothing. i explain theory i then back it up with data to test it. it's called hypothesis testing. what you are showing me is luck which is free,278
12Xpert,"this was also the primary reason why i chose to ""live test"" my wocs strategy. 1 0  years of back testing is one thing but i couldn't be sure i had something that worked and wasn't simply going to mean regress. i'm now almost certain it works as it's supposed to work",266
12Xpert,i still believe it is the second. after 1 4  years of proofing tipsters i'm still inclined to believe that overconfidence is far more common than deliberately misleading people. to be fair i was the same when i started out and it took me a long time to figure out these things.,277
12Xpert,most importantly here the winning or losing of such a bet by either side does not prove one way or another what i and others have asserted which is that these systems are just flawed data mining projects. maxi if he wants to has to prove he holds +ev in other ways.,265
12Xpert,this is not how you prove a betting system is doing what it claims to do. they way you prove that is by demonstrating a priori reasons why it works and then showing it's got persistence and doesn't regress to a -ev mean because it's just based on luck. maxi's systems don't.,274
12Xpert,so it's mining data until you find patterns that are profitable? if that's the case then forgive me if i say this in no way refutes clv hypothesis. if you trawl data long enough you will always find patterns that made money. the question is do the make money in the future?,273
12Xpert,yeah makes sense although it presumably will increase with an exponent 2  regardless covid-1 9  is here to stay just like flu has been for 2 0 0 0  years and it will eventually just become part of humanity managed by herd immunity via a vaccine. it's not going to get uninvented.,279
12Xpert,then say there are things you can do so you will lose less like not chase losses and play in the lowest edge games. along with roulette is purely a game of chance and has no strategy to it. only play for fun and dont risk what you cant afford to lose.,251
12Xpert,total rubbish. if you want to change what you think is true then you are free to set up your own political party get enough people to agree with you and then change it. and i'm guessing you'd probably change it some stupid top down ideology because you think you know best.,273
12Xpert,"and not going to the pub/restaurant to be with friends? not travelling? work from home or lost earning because you're self employed or your employer refuses to pay? have to stay at home anyway because schools are closed for a year?

would you accept a year's solitary to add 2 0 ?",280
12Xpert,every back or lay will have an intrinsic true price at that precise game state. you will need to beat that true price to have ev. obviously this is a concept thats harder to grasp because on the face of it laying at a shorter price than backing completes a successful trade...,276
12Xpert,"and i get rubbished on the grounds that i can't do it therefore i have no right to say nearly everyone else can't either. that is a bs proposition.

finding a sharp tipster and being a sharp bettor is a hard thing to do and i make no apology for saying so.",256
12Xpert,"tipsters cry when i call them out for (probably) being lucky. but when asked to prove they're not (or to show me tipsters they can prove are not) they'll never reveal their ""secrets"". kind of catch 2 2  ain't it? sports betting's a funny world. not like this in poker or finance.",279
12Xpert,yes you're right. i must have done it wrong. it was actually 0 .9 1  %  and now it's 1 .4 8  %  after 5  more winners and 2  more losers. what do i infer from that? that i could beat this record about 1 4  %  of the time just guessing?,235
12Xpert,look voy. i don't want to be aggressive with you. but you and entwolken are on my case all the time chipping away at me because you don't like my message about tipsters. i've seen so many tipsters in my life. as garry klein would say i've developed an intuition about them.,273
12Xpert,i certainly feel the life drain out of me waiting for a goal to be adjudicated. fans and players alike have said as much. you can't celebrate. and in football is a low scoring game hence why even 1  goal matters so much. rugby has about double the average number of tries.,272
12Xpert,that's irrelevant. your response was the fallacy. you would win the argument by proving that a reduction in online casino game limits would lead to a reduction in problem gambling although even if you managed that it might not justify the impact it would have on the other 9 9  % .,281
12Xpert,knowing what i know about customer conversions and staking from my affiliate work i'm estimating the ratio of bet3 6 5 :pinnacle customers is counter-balanced by pinnacle:bet3 6 5  average stake. hence we arrive at a annual sports turnover figure in the region of  $ 1 0 0  billion (2 /2 ),289
12Xpert,of course. it's a relative skills game. take out the 9 9  %  and the remaining 1  %  would then subdivide into another 9 9  %  and 1  %  (or something like that). being a pareto-type distribution it's recursive indeed almost fractal i.e will look the same no matter what the scale.,281
12Xpert,not a massive takeaway really. if o/c  1  that means prices (on average) are shortening. if  1  it means they are lengthening. winning bets show o/c 1  and losing bets show o/c  1 . it's as you'd expect but it's nice to see confirmation of a betting market doing what is should.,278
12Xpert,on average the bookmaker knows what the true price is; so do the sharps. i just go back to the same place. if it was systematically more than the margin it would be obvious to enough people meaning the bookmaker would lose too much money if it remained more than the margin.,274
12Xpert,"what do you think  

""9 9  %  of cases there was no value there."" this from someone who's attempted to make his livelihood from following them. that's skin in the game if ever i saw it. but perhaps he writes to much for your liking.

time to shut your damn mouth maybe?",269
12Xpert,if they were just taking money off the really rich but square 1  %  then eventually they would become richer than those losers and would have to find another source. but if that 9 9  %  all thought the same they just wouldnt bet at all because theyd be almost no value.,269
12Xpert,"you can calculate the kelly stakes yourself using the following.

full kelly  %  = value/odds - 1

where value is expressed as a decimal percentage for example 3  %  = 0 .0 3 .

so quarter kelly stake for odds 6 .0 0  with value 5  %  = 0 .2 5  % ",247
12Xpert,nonsense. think about it. a bookmaker is a risk manager. yes they may still want to take money off pgs if the argument that they are no better than drug pushers is correct but they would not be able to accept the same level of staking. ask yourself what you would do.,267
12Xpert,both are certainly present in all markets. the question then become what is the relative weight? clever people like your good selves might be able to make rational decisions based on intrinsic analysis but can the same be said of most of the 9 8  %  who are alleged to be winning?,280
12Xpert,you see it's statements like this that ring alarm bells. by design gambling is a winner-takes-all market. so if 9 8  %  (or whatever the figure is) are winning who is paying for the losers? that's how castle in the air (and ponzi if it's fraud which to repeat this isn't) works.,278
12Xpert,well good for him and well done you. greyhounds is niche market so opportunity for someone who knows their stuff to succeed. but the trouble is that bookmakers will not allow it. 3 6 5  have let you carry on simply because they are so large they can soak it up longer.,268
12Xpert,1  %  of tipsters tipping asian handicap at pinny would be profitable after 1 0 0 0 0  plays through nothing more than guessing. just coz you find a profitable tipster that doesn't imply he's any good. almost always they are just lucky you've been fooled and that's what you pay for.,283
12Xpert,then you are dealing with one choice. do you bet both sides thereby paying a small guaranteed fee to watch the game? or do you bet only one side and get the added anticipation of an uncertain outcome where you might win or you might lose? the choice depends on the individual.,276
12Xpert,so presumably the defence against my defence is gambling can be addictive so why force people to do it to watch football. but there are many things in life that are addictive which we have to pay for and that is perfectly ok. i just think it's people getting squeamish about it.,278
12Xpert,if we were ever granted access to all time player profits you would see a classic power law distribution. look at similar for poker (via hendon mob database). top is  $ 5 6  million. 5 0 th percentile (median) is just  $ 1 8 0 0 . sports betting will be similar.,262
12Xpert,"for those who have enjoyed the bingo cards in the past im currently working on a data build that hopefully i will be able to share with you all i have attached a screen shot below of some elements i am working on 

thanks as always to  for sharing the raw data",260
12Xpert,here's the cumulative percentage losses for 4 0 5 0 0  sports bettors over a 9  month period in 2 0 0 5  ranked by player losses. 5 0  %  of the losses come from 2  %  of the players. data source and paper is fully referenced in my last book.,242
12Xpert,ras = risk adjusted score. so you award a score of 1  - 1 /odds for a win and -1 /odds for no win. is a means of seeing how a team has performed relative to what the market expected. in this case the market is fair closing  odds (margin removed).,246
12Xpert,depends what odds you have and whether you only took out the 0 -0  retirements. i also took the matches where the odds were the same for each player. here's the first 5  lines in my spread sheet you can see the formula for he favourites column. opposite for the dogs.,267
12Xpert,"more great analysis from jbm. and no reference to the words ""racist"" and ""thick"" in sight. i'd also like to add the word ""trust"". ironically it turned out the 'blue collar' class trusted boris more than corbyn to give them what they want. the next question is can he deliver it?",278
12Xpert,"i suppose i could feel some guilt for getting punters' accounts closed. however i'd say 3  things. 1 ) they'll ban you for being a 'winner' whatever your system so you'll need to find those ""ways"". 2 ) if you're good enough to beat sharp books then bet at those instead.",270
12Xpert,"that's beside the point. chris (and i) make this idea available so people can try it. it's up to them how they find ""ways"" to protect their soft book accounts. it can be done. patrick veitch managed to take tens of millions off them despite them constantly trying to stop him.",276
12Xpert,rereading  work reminds me you could have +ev system that loses over a signficant number of samples. looking at 1 0 0 0 s of paths with most successful still leaves some that arent. those are careers and hours spent working on a +ev system that was quality yet still lost,271
12Xpert,"his average odds are 2 .5 7 . that's not super high.

we've had this debate many times. there's always the possibility he's just super lucky but the longer he goes with an upward trend to his actual bankroll the more likely it is that there's another explanation. i've offered two.",281
12Xpert,i mean in the extreme every bet is massively inefficient because outcomes are either 0  %  or 1 0 0  %  but odds are never those. but clearly single outcomes are hugely influenced by variance (luck) which is why it is meaningless to try to talk about (in)efficiency at that level.,280
12Xpert,it seems counterintuitive i'd have though over a sample as small as 3 4  that it might matter. but it doesn't. i've seen this before regarding kelly staking and whether it matters if you know or don't know precisely your edge for every bets. it doesn't you just need the average.,279
12Xpert,and by ordering all the 3 9  %  bet together hopefully this gives an opportunity for more losing sequences to occur. but i'm afraid it doesn't. the outcomes are basically the same. so it seems it won't matter what distribution or order your exp rois are in only the average matters.,282
12Xpert,if you can do 2  %  long terms with a turnover of thousands of bets per year you will have subdued the variance monster sufficiently to make a living from it. if you only have hundreds of bets per year you're wasting your time.  gets this he'll explain it to you.,263
12Xpert,i didn't exclude anything. i picked a date. i neither chose to exclude nor chose to include. i just picked a before date and then looked to see how those who were still there are done in the intervening period and compared it to how they had done before that date.,264
12Xpert,ask pyckio nicely and do it again. they'll have about 6  or 7  times the amount of data i had to analyse. do it for the minor markets. there should be enough data now. let's see what we'll find. we mind find a non random distribution but lets find the evidence.,261
12Xpert,looking forward to your evidence that it's 7 0  %  true however on earth you are meant to prove something as vague as this. you can't make sweeping statements like this without evidence. have you got it? for example a distribution of the performances of 1 0 0 0  badminton punters?,281
12Xpert,that depends on the performances. we are back to p-values again. ultimately you will never know for sure if a tipster is skilled or even was skilled and is no more. i think you need to apply a scatter gun approach in looking for numerous signals that are indicative of skill.,275
12Xpert,please no affiliate-hater ever tell me again that i don't want people to win. i gave you all this method completely free of charge and chris took it to the next level. yes you might well get banned by recreational books; that is your conundrum to figure out how to stop.,270
12Xpert,she did choose to move to a stable surely knowing that he was under a cloud of suspicion. if she didn't ignorance is unfortunately no defence in doping in professional sport. that's how it is and how it has to be even if you don't like it. professionals know these rules.,271
12Xpert,how sad hassan doesnt even realise shes been used by salazar as a puppet and hes ruined her reputation because no one can believe in her ever again. doesnt really help her case running 3 :5 1 . and of course as mj says she made the choice to join him.,251
12Xpert,that's kind of stupid on their part because i'd have thought you're far more likely to increase turnover if they offer you 2  %  and make more profit from you. suggest to your account manager that you would certainly be increasing turnover by more than a factor of 5 /2 .,271
12Xpert,true. but puzzle here is why you could still make a profit if you bet closing prices of nish's tips. if clvh is correct and pinny are paying attention to nish that shouldn't happen. the point of my analysis was at least to show their closing tennis prices aren't fully efficient.,279
12Xpert,"you did say ""definitely something to take into account for the future."" but actually you haven't the slightest idea if it is you're just assuming it because you've started shit this season so draw the conclusion that it might not be a good idea to start a season at the beginning",279
12Xpert,and if that is not what the european elite is striving for then they should be straight will people and tell them it means more greek-style bail outs. the eu is like a cancer patient receiving endless cycles of chemo that have hugely unpleasant side effects just to keep it alive.,280
12Xpert,oceans absorb a lot of co2  but over hundreds/thousands of years will put a lot back into the atmosphere. in theory that might hold the planet in a much longer interglacial. might there be another return to ice age? maybe i suppose at least if it happens it would be delayed.,275
12Xpert,and since then the surface temperatures have been increasing now about 1  degree celsius above global average pre-industrial value. doesn't sound much but to give some perspective the earth was only about 5 c cooler as an average in the last ice age northern uk was under 2  thousand m ice,289
12Xpert,so in the 1 9 6 0 s when surface temperature records were showing cooling scientists started to wonder if we where heading towards the next ice age. then in the 7 0 s we realised the increase in greenhouse gases due to industrialisation could in theory cause a global warming.,276
12Xpert,no not any more (it used to be 9  % ). my general point really is that telling people they are bad for gambling which is indirectly what anti-gamblers do when they say gambling is bad is that you don't actual solve the problem of excessive gambling. better to understand gambling.,280
12Xpert,to answer your question of how many bets then a rule of thumb would be minimum 1 0 0 0  but it could be a lot more than that. it depends on so many factors. there are other quicker ways to determine these things like closing line value. for example here:,254
12Xpert,ive shown many times that in football at least which is your preferred sport the ratio of the bet price to closing price is an excellent predictor of advantage. but you carry on believing your nonsense. if youre a winner long term well done if not youll have no idea why.,271
12Xpert,that's how it worked for major brown and may. if you want to change that for example become a republic vote for parties who want that too. if enough of you vote for it you win and get to change it. that's democracy. until then quit whining. kinda like brexit really.,266
12Xpert,"well you have to think of this as a data mining exercise. if you endlessly test data until you find something you want to find and then declare it meaningful you may well be ""deluding"" yourself (i hope that translates into spanish). hence why you need to use a p-value correction",279
12Xpert,patrick veitch made tens of millions off soft books. if you have the motivation and are prepared to work hard then there are ways you can makes these things work. nothing in betting is easy. it shouldn't be if it was everyone would do it then it would stop being easy.,268
12Xpert,"plenty of references in my book. fama did a pretty good job.
fama e. f.  french k. r. 2 0 1 0 . luck versus skill in the cross-section of mutual fund returns. the journal of finance 6 5 (5 ) pp. 1 9 1 5 -1 9 4 7 .",213
12Xpert,doesn't follow. if a bookmaker exploits a square's bias in making a 1 .9 5 /1 .9 5  market that wins 4 9  % /5 1  %  the bookmaker will make more than the vig of him but the fader will still show a loss of -0 .5 5  % .,218
12Xpert,i concur. if betting was that easy everyone would do it and then it would stop being possible and stop being easy. until it became easy again and then everyone would do it and then it would stop being possible and stop being easy. until it became easy again and then....,270
12Xpert,to be fair  has been decent beyond other bookie ceos in reaching out to his customer base. but it's tinged with what he and his team did to his affiliate prog (there was no need for it). he will have done very nicely from the pokerstars buyout who probably drove it.,266

12Xpert,i'm guessing the methodology penalised man city and tottenham relative to liverpool for not drawing very much. perhaps that implies that awarding 1  point for a draw is too high relative to the points you get for a win. how would the table look if it was 4  for a win?,268
12Xpert,ahh you reminded me.  when are you going to respond to my revolver complaint? it's only a few weeks now before i'm allowed to raise it with ibas. that's going to be so much fun. they're as broken as you are which is why you get away with what you do.,250
12Xpert,as before i must point out that there are no time stamps for either sets of odds so we aren't comparing like with like exactly. but i suppose the timing of pinnacle's opening odds will more comparable to 5 3 8 's updated predictions after previous matches than their closing odds.,280
12Xpert,(2 /2 ). so suppose you ask for a price at betfair based on 'true' pinny price. some will get matched and some won't but i fear there will be a systematic bias in what does and doesn't get matched. it will be the pinny errors that will get disproportionately matched.,267
12Xpert,just a lot of nonsense. why would anyone pay such fees. based on the historical records of the 1 0 3  tipsters you could copy now you pre-cost expected roi is about 1  % . about half have been profitable half not. you know where i'm going with this don't you.,259
12Xpert,i have -0 .5 5  %  from 1 3 1 9  stakes in 1 0 8 5  matches. chart is date ordered. given this sample size and the average odds (4 .6 2 ) this is not a statistically significant difference compared to the overall population of bets from all leagues.,249
12Xpert,the way to do this i suppose is to see how closely their blindly backing their prices (after margin is removed) conform to a random walk about the profit line (roi = 1 0 0  % ). the problem here is that i don't precisely know how they apply the margin.,252
12Xpert,indeed  already mentioned this to me. i really have no knowledge of this probably because i'm european and don't follow us sports much at all. all i can find is  a -7 .6  %  loss from 2 5 0  picks. that on it's own is not enough to call a scam.,244
12Xpert,if you've just data-mined until finding a pattern that's profitable then there's nothing more to say other than to tell other readers that your systems will almost certainly be worthless and will just mean regress. so please answer the question. did you advise these 1 6 0 0 0 + bets?,284
12Xpert,"yes if you're savvy and work hard and indulge in accounts abuse. the problem with any ""get rich easy"" message is that most people don't and won't read the small print and will assume that this means the casino game can be beaten not that the casino operator can be abused.",272
12Xpert,"it may not be. wiki quote the following: ""the rapid spread of disease to a large number of people."" presumably 'rapid' has to rule out linear and no-growth scenarios. given the timing and wording of this story it was clear the link with covif-1 9  was being made. hence my response",281
12Xpert,dont you get it? they are suggesting there are things you can do to improve your roulette success. there is nothing you can do. its a game of chance. and its implicit they are promoting this lie to boost their own revenues just at the time theyll be losing sports revenue.,272
12Xpert,"that's how vaccines work dan.

in the end that's how this will go. covid-1 9  is here to stay it will end up being managed like the flu with vaccines to contribute to herd immunity. the choice facing society is how to get there (which may take 1 2 + months).",258
12Xpert,"indeed. if you are that unsure about how to handle variance you should never have been selling your advice in the first place. if i had a  $  for every tipster that had said ""i'm learning from my mistakes"" well.... you know the rest...
your only mistake was believing in yourself.",280
12Xpert,"do they know what the cost of not doing it is? you assume that they do but do they? have the models modelled the costs of shut down properly? it's a complex system. how reliable are the models? variance?

some people see climate change as an immediate problem. who is right?",274
12Xpert,"yeah and vig and juice too. it can all get rather confusing. but the equation in the last tweet is all you really need.

plus overround is the sum of the reciprocal of the decimal odds. that's why decimal odds are so much easier to work with than us or fractional.",264
12Xpert,"we end up arguing because i'm told that i say betting is all luck and all tipsters are just lucky. and that is not what i'm saying.

you place the emphasis on there being 1  %  who can do it. i place the emphasis on being 9 9  %  who can't.",240
12Xpert,"you never show me the oranges.

pyckio is a tipster market place for people to sell or distribute their picks. i guess it suits your argument to say they are not real tipsters.

i guess only a real tipster is someone that suits your argument.

i'm getting off the roundabout now.",279
12Xpert,"""the reality you show is too one-dimential as for my taste. i have noticed that you like putting all ""tipsters"" into one sack and claiming  luck as a main factor explaining good and bad results. ""
i'm asking you to show me the other dimensions. show me the data. you'd won't.",275
12Xpert,yeah i get that. hence why i make the case that gambling is something to be enjoyed outside of  $  (dopamine). but i won't apologise for telling the truth about sports betting. and the truth is that very few people will have the aptitude/work ethic/skills to make a living from it.,281
12Xpert,i can count on the figures of one hand the number of people i've seen beat the closing line. of course i will now be told that beating it is not important. perhaps not in lo-liquidity markets but then you're going to to struggle to make a good living from those.,262
12Xpert,"empiezas a seguir a un tipster de o/u que tiene un yield a largo plazo del 1 0  %  a cuota 1 .9 .
tras un ao siguindolo con 2 0  apuestas al mes acaba en negativo. eres gafe? el tipster es un fake? qu probabilidad haba de que ocurriera esto?",241
12Xpert,i listen to people who have useful information. i don't recall you having any. just complaints that i give tipsters too hard a time. i provide evidence for my claims but you don't provide anything just anecdotes as far as i'm aware. if i'm mistaken could you show me your data,276
12Xpert,has remarked that the difference between a good and bad run in the premier league is the difference between champions league and regulation. in fact it's 2 0  points. in the national league after 2 5  %  more games (3 5 ) it's just 1 1  between possible promotion and relegation,278
12Xpert,indeed. let the referee be the adjudicator. before var debating points in the pub were about them. now it's just about whether var is good for the game. i know which debates were more fun. trying to solve this problem has just pushed it somewhere else and arguably made it worse.,279
12Xpert,"lucky you then? good  bad var 'luck' will mean regress but loss aversion will tell you that the pain of the unlucky decisions is felt stronger than the lucky ones. expected var emotion is negative.

every time we get one of these var goals my football soul dies a little more.",276
12Xpert,"lucky you then? good  bad var 'luck' will mean regress but loss aversion will tell you that the pain of the unlucky decisions is felt stronger than the lucky ones. expected var emotion is negative.

every time we get one of these var goals my football soul dies a little more.",276
12Xpert,he's using it to make a point. it could be some other unknown variable that someone cleverer than you has modelled successfully and exploits it but you can't see it coz you don't have the model and only see the aggregate data so don't know what variable it is that's relevant,275
12Xpert,so if a book uses these agents by holding a price rather than moving it in response to their money what would stop the agents hammering the price again and again and again? eventually the bookmaker would have to move the price else the agents become as rich as the book.,270
12Xpert,i think it is the presence of a view sharps that stops the market evolving too far away from efficiency.  if there were no sharps that could happen but the variance in price movement would be much bigger than observed. if there were more sharps there would be much less action,276
12Xpert,it would be remiss of me not to point out the difference between value betting and investing. in the former tossing coins (almost all of you) means you lose. in the latter you still win because in theory it's a positive sum game as natural capital is turned into social capital.,278
12Xpert,with respect to gambling they aren't given free rein. it's a heavily regulated industry far more than in other parts of the world. if you take the view that this regulation is not fit for purpose then i think the onus is on you to demonstrate you're not just anti gambling.,273
12Xpert,no it didn't it implied you hadn't. my comment about what he said implied that i find it laughable he now wants to put the people first. look i voted the same way he did in 2 0 1 6  but i lost the argument. i moved on 3  years ago.,231
12Xpert,"decided he couldn't see anymore so took a medical timeout 
naturally he apologised to the crowd and to raonic at the end but he does this sort of distraction thing so much more than the other top two goats that you simply can't believe it when he says it's not intentional.",273
12Xpert,indeed. but if they then have to start competing against more ais things get tougher for them too. if they currently can exploit human inefficiencies they may not be able to do that so readily in a future with mode models that are as good as or better than their own.,267
12Xpert,"sadly hours of work put it does not linearly correlate with reward got out in a relative skills contest. i could play 1 0 0 0 0  hours of tennis but i would never beat roger federer.

if others are doing superior quality menial tasks relative to you you will lose.",264
12Xpert,1  in 1 0 0 0 s. so that basically confirms what i've been saying for years. and it takes hard work to find him. good for you steve for having the patience to stay the course. i would have fallen short long ago had i embarked on such a course.,243
12Xpert,the difficulty comes from finding ones that are good (really not many of those) incorporating the subs and dealing with the price slippage as well as losing runs.  is an expert and has found barely 1  %  and doing it full time. i say that makes it hard work wouldn't you?,271
12Xpert,that would make sense. but i still think that push things too far from the 'true' number and too much money will come on the other side flipping the liability. i think the response of this system will be finely tuned non-linear. the sweet spot on average will be within vig.,274
12Xpert,run the scenario if you shade too much and the public notice. look at the profit heat maps i did for my pinny article. the more you shade the bigger the potential profit but the bigger the risk people start to notice and trip your expectation to a completely different one.,273
12Xpert,maybe a better test would be to get a new customer to place their first bet with a max stake on a low limit market against the value bet. if pinny move it as you would predict then you may be right. if not it's evidently more complex than you think.,249
12Xpert,might be a case for that for smaller records. but in the long rung they'll end up about the same. here's the evolution of level stakes yield versus fixed profits yield for wocs starting after 1 0 0  bets. agreed fpy is lower variance but no good for my record-test calculators,276
12Xpert,i'm still intrigued to find out if this sort of book ever existed in the uk and why it didn't in the us. i've speculated previously that the reason us books have preferred to 'honour' action was because of its roots in the mafia. does this have any credibility? anyone know?,274
12Xpert,further to this if skill is to be deliberately set aside to reveal the true nature of gambling i.e. a matter of chance what's left is the enjoyment of random property transfers. this is considered immoral and the work of the devil being as it is the repudiation of all reason.,276
12Xpert,there are people who want things and then there are other people who think those things are not good for them. imo patronising like this make it less likely you achieve your desired outcome. just look at brexit. call people bad or stupid even if indirectly and what do they do?,277
12Xpert,but i would face the same dilemma if i ran an airline company or a pub or a shop that sold scratch cards or mcdonalds or an ice cream van. or driving to work in a car that would indirectly contribute to an existential threat to the existence of the maldives.,258
12Xpert,i think (maybe wrongly) that there's a pot of societal 'bads' (for want of a better word) which is largely fixed in size because of the way humans are. messing with one 'bad' will just push it somewhere else. so when we do so we're not so much fixing as juggling.,263
12Xpert,and now  is showing that even the best 'pros' largely regress to the mean and of 2 7  of them there may be only 2  or 3  who are really any good with real profitable expected value. 2  in thousands implies 9 9 .9  %  is not a bad estimate imo.,243
12Xpert,"ah i see smaller sample that's the explanation.
i used a t-tailed t-test i.e. made no presumption about whether nish would over or under perform expectation whereas the yield-dist calc is effectively 1 -tailed.
using it and doubling gives me 0 .0 0 9 2  %  for the full sample close",282
12Xpert,whilst i agree it will be the case that 8 0  %  of losses will come from 2 0  %  of customers (and this is recursive) this does not not imply that the bookmakers don't want leisure punters not does it imply that they want compulsive gamblers to keep gambling.,259
12Xpert,when you place a bet that is an economic decision based on the premise that you think you will win (or have expected value if you're more sophisticated). if you don't think those things you won't agree to bet. when both sides think they have those things they agree. consensual,277
12Xpert,it's a mix of both positions. in an ideal world a bookmaker would want equal action to keep things simple. but bettors are biased so don't facilitate bookmakers' wishes all the time. hence a bookmaker also has to know how to price a line to ensure he's not facing -ev.,268
12Xpert,"i know you were. i was simply making one too. 
the nordic model has much to commend it but it will have to figure out a way to sustain itself as populations age. sweden for example appears to have embraced massive immigration to solve it. that will create new tensions.",269
12Xpert,only explanation i have that a large sample would not be in line with clvh is if pinny was intentionally biasing the market to mop up mug money allowing sharps to have a share of it because overall it's more profitable like that and the sharps are finding the value.,266
12Xpert,"i think poker theorist david sklansky was the first i heard say that if 5  %  is a threshold 1  in 2 0  tests should randomly hit it.

and what gambler doesn't test 2 0 + systems?

significance comes on a continuum is relative and a description not a prediction.",262
12Xpert,i'm a bayesian skeptic. when someone presents evidence for me to update my priors i update my priors. for example you encouraged me to look at the idea of a skewed distribution for a bettor's expected bet-rois. it is a good idea. i looked but so far didn't find evidence.,271
12Xpert,here's a plot of t-scores which measure the performance deviation away from expectation over 5 0 -bet samples in my wisdom of crowd history. they look pretty symmetrical and normally distributed to me. 6 7 .8  %  within +/-1  sigma 9 5 .6  %  within +/- 2  sigma of mean.,271
12Xpert,that is to say sometimes pinny will be more accurate sometimes betfair but where betfair is longer (and i bet their odds) it will be betfair that is systematically more accurate (and vice versa) and hence what i think is value will not be. i wish it were not so.,262
12Xpert,certainly something worth thinking about but on what grounds do you think it should be considered? not just what you see but something more fundamental about the nature of betting outcomes. besides 1  in 1 0  years is still really only 1  in 5 0 0  weeks if betting weekly.,273
12Xpert,hence the scope for skill to be a factor unavailable in roulette. but 1 ) the noise is much bigger than the signal and 2 ) betting is a relative skills contest so the more players with skills compete the more they will cancel each other out leaving only luck.,259
12Xpert,"this is just anecdotal. how do i know how many bets these low-liquidity 'sharps' have made relative to the rest? how do i know whether they aren't just using more softbooks to get their yields (which is easy)?

show me the data. show me that's true at a sharp bookmaker.",270
12Xpert,as for liquidity it has nothing to do with anything. go to a casino. bets by players will not be random. they'll be using all sorts of nonsense money management. will also be causally related to income risk tolerance and addiction. but that's nothing to do with the game maths.,277
12Xpert,again i don't know why i'm even bothering with this conversation. no betting is not roulette but for nearly everyone who does it it might as well be. their outcomes are effectively the same as if it was random. that's because the link between cause and effect is so weak.,271
12Xpert,indeed most tipsters/punters are blind to their own inability. with regards tipsters that might just make only stupid. but when people like me point out that they might be the duty falls on them to prove to their customers that they are not. in my experience most cant or wont,276
12Xpert,are there any circumstances where you would accept the result and accept that if a deal can't be agreed (either with the eu or in parliament) then article 5 0  implies we leave with no deal? as i see it remainer parliemantarians are playing heads i will tails you lose.,269
12Xpert,if the basis of vote or referendum is that the majority wins then its in the interests of the people to honour it. if leaving the eu is a mistake that can be put right. disregarding individuals right to have their opinion respected and honoured is much harder to fix.,267
12Xpert,there doesnt need to be a border. its just rule-obsessed politicians who put projects ahead of people. boris has said there wont be a border from the uks perspective. no reason why there cant be a transition period with goods moving as now until a free trade deal is done.,272
12Xpert,i don't necessarily agree that it's increased relative to may's deal. with may's deal there was zero chance of getting a trade deal with the us. with no deal there is a non zero probability. one may well say a deal with trump is a bad deal. that's another story.,262
12Xpert,so what happens next in a natural context over hundreds/thousands years? who knows. i would expect by the time we halt greenhouse gas concentration rises (probably by end of 2 1 st century) earth will be committed to about a 3 c average temp rise (so 2  more to go).,266
12Xpert,i think others have revealed that it's about their 2  units p offer. they appear now to be advertising the inferior prices that come with this offer on the odds comparisons. if you want the better odds you don't get the 2  units p offer. at least that's my understanding,270
12Xpert,"dear  i'd like to 'request a bet' via  could you please tell me what odds you will offer for the following.
""your affiliate team to resolve non-payment of affiliate revenue with 1 4  days of telling me my valid neteller id is invalid."" we are 7  days in so far",260
12Xpert,so bruno never did make his  $ 2 4  million. whoever owns it now is obviously still scamming. no one would sell 6 0  % + win rates. if these were possible long term it would be your personal gold making machine. touts advertising these are either cheats or deluded.,265
12Xpert,of course it's likely that someone spending 5 0  on the horses is not likely to learn much. but if financial risk taking was taught properly in schools then perhaps it would reduce the incidence of problem gambling. clearly demonising it is ineffective much as the war on drug is.,280
12Xpert,did i say it was. the point is that it's most of whom voted brexit. the rest will be the third of labour voters and two-thirds of conservative voters who are pro brexit. it's unknown how many of those would want hard brexit. but hard brexit wasn't on the paper.,261
12Xpert,at least 3 5  %  of the voting public definitely voted for wto brexit if the euro elections are anything to go by. that's about 2 /3  of those who voted brexit. i think the idea that people didn't know what they were voting for has been put to bed.,248
12Xpert,"how is ""i'm not good enough to beat a sharp book"" which i'm on record saying many times being generous to myself? remember i'm not selling tips. and for those who aspire to what part of this image is not ""almost all sharp book tipsters are lucky?""  (sample is thousands.)",271
12Xpert,but in many cases it hasn't removed subjectivity just added to it. makes great tv but then so did contentious decisions before var. so long as everyone is clear what var can and can't do and is accepting of it then it's fine and we can all move on. no?,252
12Xpert,what an absurd argument. taken to its extreme nothing would ever get done because we would be paralysed by the though that the future would always be a victim of the past. but if that's what you think stand on a ticket and get enough people to agree with you.,259
12Xpert,if  use such an image on their own website without seemingly been pulled up for it why should anyone believe that a voluntary industry body for affiliates would have any use at all. would i be able to go to them and say my bookmakers has broken tcs? not likely.,261
12Xpert,this is indeed correct. however it's not the refusal of winners i have a problem with that is their right but it's the lack of transparency about why customers are restricted and now the promotion of using your wits as a reason to become a customer. this verges on mis-selling,276
12Xpert,he's going to outperform nearly all those who think that they can outperform him. there are people who say they bet for a living. most of those will go bust because they never actually had skills better than the pinny trader who's access to the most sophisticated models and data.,280
12Xpert,you may be the only person in this thread up to now who has contributed nothing jez. my threads are to facilitate debate about things which are to a significant extent unknown and uncertain. i don't see your name in the forbes rich list so presumably you're not sure either.,274
12Xpert,all companies do this in my experience. i presume it's attract new custom. it's just like the bookmakers. advertise value but if you take it more than once don't expect to be allowed to exploit it in the future. as with bookmakers a simple law change would cut it out.,268
12Xpert,if by virtuals you mean esports they do offer the possibility to model and find +ev. for casino there is no mathematically possible +ev and pointless debating it. however deposit bonuses can give you +ev if you play the right games but their abuse would get you banned i assume,277
12Xpert,"its quite clear they are attempting to mislead people into believing there are things you can do to become a winner.

someone has to win at roulette so why not you? read some of the best key tactics of how to win with a developed roulette strategy at roulette geeks.",266
12Xpert,this applies at all times when your tipster has had a poor run and changes methods to put thing right like markets bet frequency and staking. this is equivalent to loss chasing. its an admission that they had no idea why things went wrong indeed no idea whether they had.,271
12Xpert,more importantly: would you rather have a 9 0  solar orbit expectancy living a fearful life or a 7 0  solar orbit expectancy living a joyful life? imo fear is just another commodity modern people have decided they like to consume and as with others at the expense of happiness.,277
12Xpert,"overround = 1 0 4 .7 6  % 
expected profit for bookmaker = 4 .7 6 /1 0 4 .7 6  = 4 .5 4  % 
expected payout by bookmaker = 1 0 0  %  - 4 .5 4  %  = 9 5 .4 6  % 

why do you ask?",177
12Xpert,let me do my stuff and i'll let you do yours. and if you can show me data that says i've got it all wrong about bettors and tipsters i'd love to see it because i love to learn new stuff and change my ideas if i've got something wrong.,234
12Xpert,youre basically trying to say that if the true price is 2 .0 0  and bookmaker a has 2 .1  and bookmaker b has 1 .9  then betting 2 .1  is not a real value bet because only one bookmaker offers value. have you any idea how stupid this sounds?,241
12Xpert,"i've had every success at value betting just at bookmakers who won't let me anymore.
i've shown my data so many time on tipsters but you just say it's rubbish data. then i show you  data on 'pros' (mean regressing) and you'll still tell me they are not pros really",264
12Xpert,further if you think i offer utility in calling out frauds what does it matter if my motivation is either a) wanting to protect people from getting scammed by false/blind claims of tipping skill or b) an ego thing because i'm annoyed i can't do it. outcome is the same.,269
12Xpert,the lottery is not a competition. penalty shoot out are. what counts is the relative difference in skill between 5 + takers and one saver on both teams. if this is small noise in outcome is large. would be true if scoring a penalty had a 9 9  %  chance.,253
12Xpert,but hopefully writing about the mechanisms of a betting market is helpful in some respect even if it's not offering the holy grail. besides for soft book bettors i've given them the holy grail (woc) completely for free. i apologise to you now if you've had all you account shut,277
12Xpert,if you listen to the podcast youll hear marco say its 1 0 0  %  data analysis and 0  %  balancing action. its all about the line efficiency. of course this means piinacle will take positions but in the long term the law of large numbers will care of those.,256
12Xpert,"allegedly my team is winning the pl because they've benefited.

you honestly enjoy waiting for a computer to tell you if a goal has been scored? i'll say it again: we might as well just scrape real players and play fifa2 0  if all that matters is a computer algorithm.",268
12Xpert,this is all so obvious but i guess there are just some whose virtue signalling gives them a reason to get out of bed every day. a shame they aren't invested in solving problems. i suppose if they were they wouldn't be advertising the very moral deviance they complain about.,274
12Xpert,"at my age my memory is not what it was which was pretty hopeless to begin with anyway.
you were indeed the inspiration for the article but when i saw the numbers it just struck me that given the things levitt had reported anything much larger would just get smashed.",266
12Xpert,"yes. which would make me high-functioning. it's you who doesn't get it.

i've done more than anyone else to try to find an answer to the question in the betting world. like eugene fama did with mutual fund managers. all you have done is disagreed offered nothing else in return.",278
12Xpert,"from my reading (and writing) i've concluded that people crave those chances and hopes to feel in control. if you can predict the future which is uncertain then it proves you are a ""somebody"" rather than a ""nobody"" with status and kudos. much like a tribal shaman or witch doctor.",280
12Xpert,yes i get that but really this no different to someone hoping that they are right about the earth being flat. most sane people understand the concept that the house is against them (because that's what they're told) but still hope that it won't apply to them when they visit.,275
12Xpert,of course such a scenario is low probably but that is the point of black swan events: low but non zero probability where outcomes are potentially ruinous. the time frame of this game may be much longer than the age of civilisation to date so we have a biased view.,264
12Xpert,and it has nothing to do with straw men. it's about allowing a legal industry to promote itself to a population which likes to do the things that are being advertising to them and whom almost all behave sensibly. i don't people like you taking that way from me thanks.,268
12Xpert,all it does is allow you to make a subjective judgement about whether you are. the smaller p-value or the larger the 1 -in-x number the more likely it is that you may conclude that you are not just lucky. but it doesn't that you are more than just lucky.,254
12Xpert,"and is this not an argument that books aim to be close to the 'true' (efficient) number more than balanced action?

(my answer: i think it's both and depends on the market and the match but books will never stray too far from 'true' because sharps would not let them.)",268
12Xpert,i can't answer that. the data source is as reported in the original tweet. basically large sharp bookmakers so anyone familiar with nba markets at these books (i'm not) will have an idea of the timeframe. i assume since teams play daily it won't be more than 2 4  hours.,270
12Xpert,the existence of sharps must mean that inefficiencies exist. however they are at a scale and resolution that takes a lot of hard work to find. that is why there are so few sharps and why it is hard to see deviations from efficiencies when looking at averages like this.,269
12Xpert,of course if one proposes this one then has to propose a hypothesis for why this might happen. i can imagine that bookies might bias a few matches based on public money behaviour but for there to be equal and opposite systematic biases cancelling out seems a stretch to me.,273
12Xpert,i'm not sure. the amount of time and energy you can waste not learning the process yourself but trusting others who turn out to be either rubbish on insufficient could be better spent learning the process yourself. so after 1 0  years it may be just as hard either way.,269
12Xpert,trust me with respect to pro-betting if your numbers are true (and i have no reason to doubt them) you are smart very smart probably 1  in 1 0 0 0 0  smart. if i was clever enough to build a model to show you how and why i would.,229
12Xpert,why the headline then? we know readers rarely get to the end of a news piece. the headline is designed to capture the imagination. so really just more of the same from  despite any nuance that might appear in the content which few will bother getting to the end of.,265
12Xpert,the fact that recreationals artificially shift markets by more than the vig for advertising purposes and then have to ban in the region of 5  %  of their customers (probably 1 0  times the proportion of sharp book winners) is evidence enough that people know when shading is too great,284
12Xpert,if the 9 9 .5  %  who didn't have a gambling problem didn't gamble then there would be far less volume for problem gamblers to bet against hence staking limits would be much lower. obviously doesn't apply to things like fobts but the govt's already dealt with that via regulation.,280
12Xpert,given that fi themselves report that only 2  %  of their customers say the tended to lose money with fi the answer is blindly obvious to me. evidently it is not to you which is why your ego and overconfidence continues to defend this product against some very valid observations.,279
12Xpert,in the end someone has to pay because money doesn't grow on trees. and typically with the way gambling markets are structured it is a large number of losers who pay for a small number of winners. i can't see this being different other than this truism is being time-delayed.,274
12Xpert,frankly i don't really care. if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck. that's pretty much my means of judging the inherent risk of an investment strategy. if i'm wrong then i'll take up bird watching instead.,259
12Xpert,look it's simple for me as one who's risk averse. i'm wary of investment products that look like they're built on people's desire to get rich rather than fundamental value of things. same with bitcoin. for me that's all there is to it.  you're welcome to take a different view.,277
12Xpert,what you're effectively saying is that i should draw conclusions from the 'dark pool' of clever guys who know what they are doing but remain hidden and that will prove how good tipsters are. i might as well believe in god if we chuck out evidence based science like this.,271
12Xpert,arguably i contribute more in tax that would have been contribute had that money been spent in other ways to business which make losses hence pay no tax or to businesses whose tax footprint is smaller than mine because it typically is and i've chosen to remain a sole trader.,275
12Xpert,yes i thought would say that. no credit for being straight. had i not been upfront you'd have held that against me too. you're entire presence on my thread is hollower still. you follow me presumably because you gamble. which means you when you win you take money off others.,275
12Xpert,well evidently if the licence fee stayed the same it would have to be since presumably the bookmakers would calculate that 8 0  %  of the revenue to cover the screening rights would come from 2 0  %  of the customers. hence the  majority would may less the minority more.,271
12Xpert,i liken be to einstein as emh is to newton: the latter does a pretty good job in most circumstances. if it didn't then it would be much easier for more people to win. after the costs of playing what proportion of players can really say they have true alpha?,257
12Xpert,i think somewhat this is straying from the issue. which is: how can you tell the difference between structural market evolution and regression to the mean for example when you start losing? to put it another way: how do know you ever had an edge when it appears to disappear?,275
12Xpert,i don't doubt for a second that markets do evolve. i talked about that in my book. but how do you know when it's happening? that's the point. technical analysis is basically useless in that respect since it's all just hindsight and probably too late by the time you know.,271
12Xpert,however if the latter you still have a problem that there simply aren't enough bets to make it worthwhile. pros need high turnover and large numbers of bets to deal with variance. 3 2  bets per year even at short odds won't give you that. what is the year-to-year variance?,273
12Xpert,""" have an xg database containing over 1 5 0 0 0  matches. the expected goal difference in this match was just over 4  in liverpools favour making this the joint-eighth best away performance by this measure... and the finest from the 1 3 2 8  premier league matches.""",266
12Xpert,"i think it's highly improbable that books don't know how to quickly differentiate""sharps"" from ""luckies"". if you and i know the difference and know how to tell the difference i think they will too. just have to look at clv and the sorts of bets they make. easy patterns.",270
12Xpert,yes that i think is the way forward. materially i can't believe it would actually affect their business at all and the bonus is you deal with the transparency (or lack of) issue. just be honest about the sort of customer who's not welcome. casinos manage to do this.,266
12Xpert,"unless you make the distinction when moaning about recreational bookmakers who close accounts it's so easy for them to say ""look at all these customers with profits"". in fact on a short term basis (1 0 0  bets) probably around a third will be winners in the profitable sense.",275
12Xpert,it might be the case. but it could also be that the bookmaker sets -7  knowing it should be -5  the sharp exploits it telling the bookmaker that line is really -7  but they also know that the squares will disproportionately keep betting -5  because they suffer psychological bias.,280
12Xpert,3 ) if you're not good enough to beat a sharp book then and get banned from soft books consider that they are saving you livelihood because they would only let you continue if you were a loser. in which case i've done you a favour getting you banned.,250
12Xpert,hmm i'm not sure. for future price movements to be random that would imply no bias in the way humans interpret past information that has arrived at the market. i.e. once it's arrived then it's public and fully reflected in the price move. that might not be the case.,266
12Xpert,"most punters don't get variance and most of the ones that do can't handle it.

it's a funny thing. the biggest addiction humans have is uncertainty; it is also the thing most easily and frequently misunderstood. we crave to control it yet when we fail come back for more.",271
12Xpert,"the two explanations i have are:

1 ) nish is hitting on same tennis inefficiency that pinnacle knowingly offers punters because they know they will make more money by offering it.

2 ) the fact that he and many of his customers operate via a broker influences pinnacle's response.",281
12Xpert,i've put together my main leagues data since 2 0 1 6 /1 7  so basically since the book was published. just a straight comparison betting colder teams versus betting hotter teams. odds are pinny closing with margin removed (log function). t-test p-value = 0 .0 1 5 .,265
12Xpert,i see. the bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. in this example i suppose binomial says m1  and m2  have about the same likelihood. priors are therefore important and bayes weakness is where they are hard to define.,281
12Xpert,"don't recall using the word ""quantitative"".

you still need a way to measure. there is the scientific method and there is faith (one of my friends also says there's poetry too). i'll stick to the first and encourage others to do so. it's worked quite well for modern society.",275
12Xpert,we allow trash food and drink advertising during sports (and a whole load of other shows) and these ruin far more lives (as measured by number of solar orbits a person manages to achieve as well as quality of life during those orbits). morality is definitely a funny thing.,273
12Xpert,i don't bother separating home draw and away. it's entirely conceivable that bookmakers deal with draws differently. i'm under no illusion that the methods i've used to remove the margin are not the ones they use. have a look at the record and see how the draws have done.,272
12Xpert,i don't care if they are fucking gods. the fact that the top 2 0  could print money (assuming they could  might say otherwise) doesn't change the hypothesis that betting performances look very similar to a random distribution if the other 1 0 0 0 0  are tossing coins.,268
12Xpert,that is why you could be a skilled poker player and go hundred thousand plays without profit. just ask nate silver. that is why you could go thousands of bets in sports betting and still be losing. the noise is much bigger than the signal even for skilled players.,264
12Xpert,pyckio will have enough data. ask them for it and then show me. then i'll pay attention. i won't pay attention to people who tell me the earth is flat until they start showing me the data that it's flat that can't be refuted with more robust scientific enquiry.,261
12Xpert,as you know i'll be able to find meaningless p-values a lot lower than that. really the idea of this exercise was show how easy it is to be fooled by small samples that are actually really big. most punters won't care about p-values just profits and profit trends.,264
12Xpert,well never know how much was down to greed and how much was simply regression to the mean. as for tipsters and punters its so hard to know whether you never really had what it takes once you lost it or whether the market just caught up with you.,245
12Xpert,...consequences of the actions they insist on making for others. in other words like the 2 0 0 8  bankers there is no downside for the establishment prescribing how things should be for the uneducated because they face no risks. people want to be allowed the right to decide....,278
12Xpert,you could test it but my hunch is no. taking a market average for football failed miserably. i think the reason is probably because soft books systematically bias their odds so the average will be systematically biased too i.e. errors will not cancel out to leave a wise number.,278
12Xpert,i think ive made my views quite clear. youve chosen to disagree via insults and mockery. i often reflect on my way of making a living but a cetainly wont be influenced by such an unpleasant and hypocritical character as you. probably nothing more needs to be exchanged here.,274
12Xpert,...given that the eu had rebuffed him and it was obvious the nation was split down the middle about whether to continue with membership. presumably he'd also argue that the eu doesn't have a god-given right to continue to demand membership  that nations have a right to debate it,279
12Xpert,just to reiterate with so bets just a low yield and highish average odds we have really no idea if you have anything that you ultimately intend to sell for money. and that's taken  two years. pro tipsters need to have decent bet volume. without it they are pointless.,267
12Xpert,what would the question be? and if neverleavers win it on what grounds would it be argued that there shouldn't be a third? that we know more now about what leaving meant? do we know everything there is to know about what staying means? european defence force? tax harmonisation?,278
12Xpert,what should i say? i don't follow us sports and haven't analysed their opening/closing line data but if it looks anything like soccer then pretty clear that to disregard clv is just plain silly. ratio of the odds you bet to the closing odds is excellent predictor of advantage.,277
12Xpert,yes if we're not simply talking about the lucky ones they exist but in my view fewer than 1  %  (possibly far fewer than that). is ssss you are reading? if so get to the end and then see if you have anything else you want to ask me.,232
12Xpert,im not asking him to admit its pants. im not even arguing that it is pants. im asking how he knows its not and all hes come up with so far is its only profit that matters. that position needs calling out so others dont make the same mistake.,241
12Xpert,but those things don't happen because 1 ) most bettors are overconfident and will never believe the will never have +ev and 2 ) greed drives those with -ev to believe that touts claiming +ev are telling the truth when almost always that's not so. touts are equally blind.,271
12Xpert,"""we'd just like you to stop kvetching and move to israel were you'd be happier.   just exodus from us and never interact again until time ends.""
""just like you asked someone to stop saying jews control tv?""
""jewish iq....""
""because jews don't go to jail?    duh""
well done billy.",279
12Xpert,i think it is subjective for all the same reasons. anyway we'll see how it goes next season. if there are no debates about handball penalties then perhaps you are right. if there are then we can debate if rules are being broken or whether people have different interpretations.,277
12Xpert,you have to ask yourself why it is that bookmakers have hammered the advertising of in-play and now about half of all bets are placed on in-play markets. there are two possibilities. 1 ) they are charities who like giving back to customers. 2 ) they are something else.,269
12Xpert,for anyone interested in betfair bots i have created a bitbucket (similar to github) account to place sample bot code and eventually a fully working acquisition bot. nothing there yet but i will be adding to it over time and hopefully soon get a website for coding tutorials too.,279
12Xpert,if a genuinely skilled tipster sells +ev tips as well as places bookmaker ads on their website then they would potentially earn revenue from both methods. if the ads are passive then the tipster is not expecting the user to sign up with a bookmaker to access the tips.,268
12Xpert,i also happen to think that with the right education about it gambling offers an excellent way to learn how to make better judgements when faced with uncertainty and risk. personally i would teach a form of in schools. perhaps then we might have avoided a global financial crash.,279
12Xpert,alternatively you go to a match on grass watch 2  big servers with no other weapons bash down serves for 3  days before one of them dies. thats not good either. entertaining players can deliver a spectacle on any surface. sport like theatre is about making and telling stories.,277
12Xpert,"let's say opening odds of pinny is a real price. but is opening odds of pinny really correct? i don't think so.
reason you( ) feel pinny's opening odds is most accurate is because they open odds at end. pinny opens first and difference without opening first is obvious.",269
12Xpert,yes but there are three ways of doing it per match. you could have it with pinny home odds and draw/away with other bookies. or you could have pinny draw and others home/away or pinny away and others home/draw. i used my f-d collected odds so a one-time snapshot.,263
12Xpert,really no point at making an official complaint to the  because whilst they will agree with me then ask the offender to stop and then tell me that they have been assured they will stop the respondent will then carry on as normal. thats how this thing works right?,263
12Xpert,the maths says i can 9  %  of the time (assuming i can get best market prices where overroud is effectively eliminated). but i though given your twitter handle you would understand that. the maths really is very easy just need a random number generator and monte carlon sim.,274
12Xpert,"it's fine be critical. that's how i learn. this whole 5 3 8  thread has already revealed to me how stupid i was to compare apples with pears. but on the ""bettors don't make money"" i'm still waiting to see the evidence that it's more an a tiny percent.",251
12Xpert,in financial investing you can study the way prices move in an attempt to predict what happens next (technical analysis charting) or you can study fundamentals like what is a company doing to get an idea of what their stock might be worth in the future. same with betting.,272
12Xpert,i've debunked your value. you've been offered the opportunity to explain why i'm wrong why you're not just charting and data mining and back testing data to find patterns. you haven't bothered. i might be wrong but you won't say why. you won't offer the theory and test it.,273
12Xpert,sorry nish i would never make a professional bet where i have no control over what i'm betting on isn't just based on pure luck and in this case i have no control. let's turn this around. would you ever bet on something professionally that looked like it held-ev?,263
12Xpert,really don't know it's not something i've spend a lot of time on. i think most people who use poisson say it's a bit crude because one team scoring a goal is not independent of the other team. there are better statisticians than me who can help you here.,254
12Xpert,but you still haven't answer my original question which i think  did for you. he said since buying this system became an option it's failed. so what i want to know is whether all bets before that were available in real time or whether it's all just back testing,261
12Xpert,ive honestly never thought about it. i suppose in a sense any of these bets are really binary options: player scores or does not score. if you then compare score odds to the true scoring rate of the player youll get an idea of what margin the bookmaker applies.,261
12Xpert,because its not harnless. obviously you cant see that. in the uk at least there is a vocal anti gambling movement highlighting problem gambling. having pages like this promote the idea that there are things you can do to be better at roulette just gives them an open goal.,272
12Xpert,"there's a third category: the group who likes to ridicule mock or insult one or t'other of the first two groups on the back of a perceived superior understanding of the problem. 

there might be a fourth: the group who likes to ridicule mock or insult the third group.",268
12Xpert,referring to yourself as an example of a +ev bettor doesn't imply that the environment is not low validity. note also i haven't said zero validity. that would be roulette. but i fear i am simply wasting more of my time with this. believe what you want to believe.,263
12Xpert,i respect the fact that you may have an edge in a niche market and are tying to exploit it for your personal gain. if you are clever enough to beat pinnacle even in something like table tennis then well done you you're better than i am at betting.,247
12Xpert,yes it's true you might have a skill in a very small niche market. but all this fucking about changing where you report things how you change your approach because of mistakes made blah blah it's all classic tipster talk. so may times i've seen it so many times.,262
12Xpert,"i can't believe that's it. in football most people think the referee is a wanker. 
i think it will have more to do with the spontaneity and simplicity of the game (football far more so than rugby). hence waiting for var to adjudicate in football is a passion killer.",266
12Xpert,why does sanders refer to himself as a democratic socialist when 1 ) he's not he's a social democrat (welfare capitalist) and 2 ) socialism doesn't win elections in the us. neither does it win in the uk and i'd have thought he'd know that from another failed septuagenarian.,274
12Xpert,makes me laugh that store card holders think they get great deals when in fact they are just being screwed for more of their money. some might tell me they are vert careful and makes sure they save. which then implies there must be others who do much worse.,257
12Xpert,"always a good read every time i see it. confirms that:
1 ) markets are becoming more efficient;
2 ) bookmakers increasingly care more about 'true' prices than balancing money even the recreational books;
3 ) it will get harder and harder to win through anything other than luck.",278
12Xpert,in poker i imagine you can more readily choose who to play against.  for example you could be an australian just waking up after a good night's sleep and playing against a table full of european piss heads just back from a night out looking to massage their egos.,263
12Xpert,i completely agree with you. the problem is that when everyone else starts doing the same as you it becomes an arms race. everyone might get absolutely better at estimating the true number but if everyone gets closer to each other then the outcomes become more defined by luck.,277
12Xpert,"furthermore if it actually is the case that the proportion of ""winners"" has grown there is really only one way that can happen: the paradox of skill. a decreasing variance of betting skill even as absolutes skills increase will mean luck plays more of a role in your outcomes.",276
12Xpert,"i did. 
shows what i know.
to be fair he had changed his serve and was destroying everybody with the new nadal. it's just djokovic has his number it seems whatever nadal he's faced with.
but i just don't see enough from zverev to every really be a great.",254
12Xpert,the point is the overall response is not linear. at some threshold there is a non-linear step change which might be over a very small range. that presents a potential liability for the bookmaker trying to figure out where it is. safer just to stay closer to 'true' line.,270
12Xpert,i would side with danshan on this one. you don't have to be dumb to lose in betting. get the world's best poker player to player 1 0 0 0 0 0  hands with the 1 0 0 0 0 th best poker player. who will be the winner?,212
12Xpert,how would i measure the certainly of value? one way is to compare to the closing price. you then find that about a third of the bets would not have been value. but how can you do that in real time before you know what the closing price is?,239
12Xpert,this is nonsense argument. presumably warren buffett would pick what he does over shelf staking. the point is how good do you have to be to make it work. anyone can stack shelves. not anyone can make a living from betting either by their own work or someone else's.,265
12Xpert,"but it would appear to correlate reasonably well with the
gambling commission's ( own figures for 2 0 1 6  to 2 0 1 8  for problem gambling percentage which is 0 .7  %  0 .8  %  and 0 .7  %  respectively for those 3  years. i.e. little change.",243
12Xpert,anyway that's not really the point. the point is public money way well go nuts on the favs and overs but a book doesn't really get a choice. if they tried to balance the action by shifting the prices accordingly the public's behaviour would flip to a different equilibrium.,273
12Xpert,how will me trialling it change my mind? don't you get it? i'm suggesting that fi's claim that 9 8  %  of customers tend not to lose with their product is a reason to be fearful (that it's built on sentiment not fundamentals). me winning won't change my fear.,259
12Xpert,oddly hypnotic. probably just nausea-inducing for arsenal chelsea tottenham and man united followers. if you grab the white dot with your mouse and move it at speed you can get an impression of just how far and fast those teams have fallen behind in the last season or so.,272
12Xpert,i've looked at it now and it has the hallmarks of a ponzi. evidently that's not the intention but that appears to have been the outcome to date which explains how almost all valuations have risen and most customers have won. when fear overtakes greed we'll see what happens.,274
12Xpert,this is not thousands and thousands of matches. it's one small minor league from a nation with a history of financial and political corruption. you might as well say 1 0 0  %  of one fixed match is fixed. i'm taking about all matches globally available on betting markets.,272
12Xpert,it's really easy. would you pay someone who said they had a system for red-black roulette? if the answer is yes you are a sucker. same applies in sports. the only difference is that almost all sports sellers are suckers too whereas for roulette almost all would be sharks.,272
12Xpert,"at least you concede that. frankly i don't know if i have a point other than let's drop all the nasty attitude (i don't mean from you) towards people who facilitate gambling drop the ""it must be worse than everything else because i believe it"" attitude and study data.",268
12Xpert,"maybe so.
suppose you had to throw 4  consecutive 9 -darters (3 6  successful darts). not a hope in hell even for pros. probably never happened even in the history of practice by anyone ever born. hence on dart throw v cue basis there's more variance in the former.",265
12Xpert,you're happy with them offering a loss-leader business model more generally so why would this be different. if society took the view it wasn't happy it could change the law insisting that bet3 6 5  charge the full fee. but as you've pointed out not easy and unintended consequences.,282
12Xpert,so change  perception. gambling addiction is 1  % . far higher for alcohol (and i might add food if obesity is the measure). it's only a financial loss. people sometimes forget it's actually fun and exciting. like going to the cinema and a meal out. also financially loss making.,279
12Xpert,"excellent research into the effective of framing of gambling warning labels from  

how about this one: ""9 5  %  of sports bettors will lose at uk bookmakers. the other 5  %  will be banned. 9 9 .9  %  of sports bettors will lose at bookmakers who let you win.""",261
12Xpert,well let's see if they manage to mean regress. if not it might be time to rethink some of the xg modelling. after all for betting purposes xg is just an arms race. one model will overtake another and then get overtaken by another and on and on.,244
12Xpert,no i dont. gambling is a product like alcohol holidays and ice cream. all cause harm. all also provide much pleasure to many people. people pick and choose their moral battles almost all of it is virtue signalling because they can so easily be shown to be hypocrites.,267
12Xpert,compared to the closing average market prices i had a 1 3 .3  %  (minus margin) advantage. really was a no brainer for them despite my protestations. i was aggrieved that they accused me of arbing but really this amounts to the same thing over the longer term.,260
12Xpert,here's an article that helps explain why it take far less time to spot a signal over the closing line than it does via results. using results can take thousands of bets using the closing line (if clv hypothesis is valid) can show something in 5 0 .,248
12Xpert,it doesn't matter what they call it so long as the law is changed to require them to say something. the onus is then on them to find a set of words that will minimise the impact to their business if indeed there would be any at all.,232
12Xpert,that was betfair exchange so basically no costs or insider trading to worry about. racing has too many runners too many variables too much variance and uncertainty and hence too much potential for inefficiency and risk for a sharp bookmaker to make work in a high tax regime.,275
12Xpert,so all that has to change is that the govt. legislates on their use of winners and winning for advertising purposes. simply insist that they must say all winning is through luck only and anyone more skilled than our traders will not be allowed to play with us.,260
12Xpert,indeed. that is the moral choice where this debate leads us. traditionally the us bookmaking industry has taken the view that it is a matter of honour to accept action from everyone who asks for it. it's different in europe. the european model is now infecting the us.,268
12Xpert,i see the thought police are seeking the arrest of lee dixon. for all the wonderful aspirations mr. corbyn has for this country he his undone by a stalinist cult following. it's so utterly feeble that people can no longer express how they feel politically without receiving abuse,279
12Xpert,i think it came out of the financial crash and brexit and trump came out of that. when people stop believing what they have been told because what they were told seems to them to be a crock shit then they will believe in anything that seems better.,248
12Xpert,yes for most polls. but 1  election doesn't negate a hypothesis. there may have been other factors at play. e.g. ukip collapse and theresa's may's policy on social care which went down like a lead balloon with traditional tory voters. pollsters may also now try to accommodate stv,280
12Xpert,"yes you're trolling. trolling is just showing up to be insulting.
what gives you the idea i don't think pinny scores clients  corrects odds accordingly? find me the place where i wrote that.
if you were really good at practice i wouldn't be having this conversation with you.",275
12Xpert,none of these twitter tipsters will be profitable because of skill. they will all be lucky. its just variance. much easier to be more heavily profitable in a high variance market. also much easier to be loss making. but those disappear from sight or just delete old records.,274
12Xpert,obviously a lot of last chapter is out of date now but the broader science is still valid. i think the strength of it lies in contextualising contemporary (and man-made) climate change within a wider natural climate system that responds over many different timescales. chps 2   5 .,281
12Xpert,the reality is that the tax burden for everyone above median wage will have to rise to pay for this. if people want these things then it has to be paid for. endless borrowing is not sustainable we've seen that. all politicians are being completely disingenuous about this.,272
12Xpert,survivorship bias. there's no letter of signatories not backing their spending plans so we have no idea about the relative numbers. i would imagine if they could be bothered it would be a lot larger than 1 6 3  but perhaps that's just me expressing my confirmation bias.,270
12Xpert,but every time i look at this with different data the bias is in the same direction. i admit (and have always admitted) it's weak and it might not be enough to make a profit in the real world outside of soft bookmakers. but i'm confident it's real.,248
12Xpert,"regarding first question i've not actually tested it.
regarding second question yes if it is real it is small.
regarding third question yes it's possible. bookmakers account for punter stupidity all the time. e.g. punters bet 6 0  to 4 0  on overs but prices don't reflect that.",278
12Xpert,"so maybe your 2 5  was a little unlucky. about 1  in 1 5 .

just to explain my monte carlo assumed odds of 3 .0 3  for all bets. you run one with your actual odds and see how it compares (if you can be bothered )",212
12Xpert,the half time data is just for completeness. to be honest without the betting odds it's questionable whether i should bother with them. i don't for the extra leagues data. no i don't bet then (apart from an occasional fun double result) because i don't have the data.,267
12Xpert,"there will always be ""fresh meat"" hence it's a great concept for the betconnect owners it's just i'm not particularly convinced that it's of sustainable value for non pros. initially it might be for pros but if the non pros get banned and become non pros then what?",265
12Xpert,"here's a review i found probably not what you had in mind:
.
i still struggling to understand the concept. to me it seems like a convoluted form of arbitrage. but surely the non pro punters are just going to get banned by their bookmakers in the end.",250
12Xpert,i've already shown you my own data that disputes this skewness. i can show you a distribution of expected roi based on odds movement (if you subscribe to clvh). that is symmetrical about the margin too. if you have a hypothesis test it don't just suppose it's true.,265
12Xpert,"i'll retweet this post as it is the most relevant amongst the posts in this thread that say a lot without saying anything at all. the thing that these ""artists"" are never able to tell you is how to tell the lucky one from the good (skilled) one.",245
12Xpert,"actually you have to pay tax the moment you born.

i agree with you both. i've thought the voting age should be lowered to 1 6  for many years. but i don't agree that it should be done for the purposes of providing an advantage/disadvantage to political parties.",262
12Xpert,you can indeed. in reality humans are not physically and emotionally mature until 2 5  or even later even thought they are capable of having children at half that age. voting age is certainly an interesting debate but i dont think it should be influenced by political expediency.,279
12Xpert,"no it hasn't look up astragalus (or knucklebones). gambling was originally about divination and preordaning the future in the same way that cave painting may have been before it. it was and still is very much a behaviour rooted in the desire to ""know"" and control the future.",275
12Xpert,i hear what you're saying and i agree real life will likely throw up skewed distributions. however i have to tell you that over samples of 3 4  bets (already big enough) it doesn't make any difference to your expected win/loss sequences. it's the average exproi that matters.,275
12Xpert,"yes binomial. i haven't used chebyshev. i would need a valid a priori reason to do so. simply saying ""my intuition tells me"" is not one. intuition is so often wrong in matters of probability. ""things that should have happened so often"" may simply mean you were wrong.",267
12Xpert,if you believe in the closing line value hypothesis which in my view is pretty solid in major markets this this evidently not true. from memory of my data analysis on this about third of pinnys prices move by more than the margin so must have contained value.,259
12Xpert,finding a needle in a haystack is problematic. i have never said there are no needles and that betting = coin tossing. i have only ever said there are very few needles finding them is hard and betting is almost like coin tossing in terms of performance outcomes.,262
12Xpert,"here's the link: 
only way you can do this properly is see what happens to the pros going forward in time. do they mean regress or do they show persistence? if it's the former then most of what they are doing is luck. that's what mean regression implies.",254
12Xpert,yes you do. you come out with some rubbish about it's only 7 0  %  random whatever the hell that means. and you offer no proof. i've offer proof that almost all you see in betting represents coin tossing. thousands of tipsters who are allegedly better than mugs.,262
12Xpert,why are you trying to retrofit causal explanations to patterns you see? now if you'd proposed a reason why bettors were going to behave differently in 2 0 1 5  on the 3 1 st december 2 0 1 4  then this would be worth paying attention to.,237
12Xpert,this wasn't. this was a blind betting of all english football league away wins in 2 0 1 5 . the outcome is to all intents and purposes random. unless of course you disagree in which case you would have known it was causal and made a fortune.,241
12Xpert,"complete nonsense. suppose bet 1  was 1 st january 2 0 1 5  and bet 2  was 3 1 st december 2 0 1 8 . what will that tell you?

unless bets are not independent of each other. but please explain how that would be the case?",220
12Xpert,i would always urge anyone who is thinking about following a tipster they have found on a tipster supermarket site to ask to see all the data the supermarket has ever collected. if they won't help find another supermarket who will since they are not to be trusted.,264
12Xpert,i would agree with you undeniably. i was merely pointing out that there seems to be a modern trait amongst intellectuals (yet idiots?) of bashing anglo saxon culture and life philosophy as if others are far superior. they're not they're just different. we are all human after all,279
12Xpert,given this is a retrospective enforcement of betting rules william hill should now retrospectively go back over all losing bets struck with them find those that have a similar contingency problem and refund all the stakes. this will not be the first such a mistake has been made,278
12Xpert,i've dm'd you my affiliate id. to reiterate for the millionth time this isn't a betting account matter. it couldn't be because you closed my account deeming it unprofitable from your perspective. it's an affiliate matter. i have to use this channel since your aff team won't reply,280
12Xpert,"sorry  and  i've had to resort to twitter again to shame you. you finally did fix your affiliate programme and ""faulty"" tracking. well done. but as far as i can see you still haven't paid outstanding revenue (back to november 2 0 1 8 ) that was promised.",254
12Xpert,besides some bookmakers already do run two different markets. one time i was told by one particularly irrelevant soft brand that i wan't allowed an advertised price but they would give me a shorter one which was shorter than the new price they shortened the original one to.,274
12Xpert,"...establishment that doesnt live or die by anything with the possible exception of trying to keep those beneath them in their place.

let people take risks. if they get it wrong they learn. theyve nothing to  learn from those who face no risk but assume they know better.",272
12Xpert,right. instead of counting wins i'm calculating returns and comparing them to those predicted. it amounts to the same thing really. but since your bet price / closing price provides a useful numerical yardstick to help bettors understand this in term of returns i do it like this,279
12Xpert,to do so does not make my a hypocrite about the former. they are separate. if you were simply talking about the former then this makes you a hypocrite because you take money off people through gambling. see i just knew we couldn't keep aah out of it.,250
12Xpert,affiliates who are also tipsters who advise bets they know in all likelihood will hold greater negative expectation to increase their rewards (e.g. accas and long odds) are in my view immoral but not because gambling is immoral (if indeed it is) but because it verges on fraud.,277
12Xpert,that's fair enough in which case this should probably remain a hobby but of course it's up to you. i'm simply pointing out what punters need to know or at least those punters that have a clue about what they need to know. fortunately for you most don't.,253
12Xpert,certainly germany does. but endless cycles of economic hardship in mediterranean countries will take its toll in the end. the only realistic way to mitigate against that is to make europe a single country with all the distribution of wealth from rich to poor that goes with it,276
12Xpert,but no one really knows how people and businesses will respond to wto rules. it's completely untested for such a major economy. i might be they respond positively to the decrease in uncertainty over the nature of brexit. once we know what we're dealing with people move on.,273
12Xpert,not if i can get my excel formulae working as i want. but certainly will make results collection longer that before so i kinda don't want to be doing it late sunday night anymore i always hated it anyway. hopefully long term users will be able to accommodate.,259
12Xpert,"it's been there a number of years yes admittedly not in the beginning. regardless as i set out in the book there is more to gambling than making a profit. ""stupidity"" was used in the context of this conversation. i actually don't think anyone who gambles is stupid.",265
12Xpert,if you're aware of it stop going boom and misleading punters that profits mean skill. your whole position on this is tautological. i effectively asked you whether profits at a roulette wheel imply skill and you said obviously not because that involves a random distribution (1 /2 ),281
12Xpert,i wish politicians had the balls to accept a referendum result and the possibility that the people might know better than they do. besides i expect come the autumn were going to get what youre advocating and with that the possibility that brexit voters will take back control.,276
12Xpert,claiming this result to be highly statistically significant seems to me to be a stretch. using my yield distribution calculator the spread bets have a p-value of 0 .0 6 3  the over/unders 0 .0 3 1 . neither are significant at alpha = 0 .0 1 .,242
12Xpert,of course if a subscriber signs up with an advertised bookie the tipster will make no affiliate revenue from the bets they advise specifically. but the subscriber may place other bets which are -ev or the tipster may acquire other referrals who bet -ev but who dont subscribe.,276
12Xpert,fobts have been regulated to. max stake down from 1 0 0  to 2  and rightly so. bookmakers or should i say their shareholders have been hammered but perhaps that means they might now get back the the proper job of odds setting by employing proper odds setters.,259
12Xpert,my point is pro sports has to consider what makes people want to watch. in the extreme imagine your team is awarded every game by default because all the others had been caught cheating. that would be pretty boring. as said professional sport for me is about storytelling.,272
12Xpert,the other side of skepticism is confirmation bias. you simply can't defend the hypothesis that clv is not accurate based on your results only. i need to see lots of tipsters/punters like you and explore the reasons why they might not move odds as much as clvh predicts.,269
12Xpert,then don't make the rule. it's obvious why these images are used. bloke gets home from pub drunk. sees image of sexy female at roulette wheel. thinks he'll play and win and females like that will find him hot. use this image intsead. would it be as effective?,259
12Xpert,"""betting cos are trying to make money not pay certain punters an income!""

before you go perhaps you could ask  to put this in their tcs and tv adverts. something like ""gambling with us is recreational only. if you are looking to make a professional income go elsewhere""",270
12Xpert,for sure but for a bet to happen between two parties in the first place both have to think they are more right than the other. that's impossible. so either one or both are irrational (they want to lose assets) or more likely they are suffering overconfidence bias.,264
12Xpert,ahh i think i get it you're creating a single implied probability by combining the two models with different weights. i think it will be hard to find signal via this method. i imagine even 5 3 8 's implied probabilities are pretty efficient when compared against outcomes.,272
12Xpert,that's correct. the service was  which operated as a verification service from 2 0 0 5  to 2 0 1 4  (and 4  years via football-data before that). about 3 0 0  services were verified and about 2 0 0 0 0 0  tips. almost entirely coin tossing.,240
12Xpert,basically i test my margin removal model against blanket betting and try to get a random walk about the profit line. but if i achieve that this does not imply my model is correct because it could be that pinny's prices are intentionally inefficient. we just don't know.,269
12Xpert,but the thing is i don't find them very amusing either i find they make fun of people who are potentially compulsive in their behaviour. if they already experience self-worth issues is this going to make it less likely or more likely they continue to feel those things?,269
12Xpert,"yes and yes. so you're right we would probably expect this. this is not so much an attempt to say the ratings are rubbish more asking the question ""what is the point of pre-closing ratings like these if they aren't sophisticated enough to do better than closing odds?""",268
12Xpert,in this case my blind sample is simply bet every home draw and away at 2 1 9 1 5 /5 4 6 1 5  stake size to ensure that the two samples end up with the total same stakes. perhaps i should have called it blanket betting.,218
12Xpert,"i don't believe his ""inefficiency"" is real. the sample size is too small. i've given you samples in the thousands with big profits to closing pinny prices never mind junk bookies that are totally worthless. betaminic has given you samples of 5 -figures that are all worthless too",279
12Xpert,that's great so if you know selling systems based on data mining is bollocks why are you doing it? or are you actually doing something else? if so what? you don't need to give away the precise methods just explain how it's a priori rather than a posteriori.,257
12Xpert,here's another wonderful system: back  closing price draws 3 .2 7  to 3 .3 5 . 1 0 6 .5  %  roi from 2 4 4 4  bets from august 2 0 1 2  to december 2 0 1 5  p-value = 0 .0 0 0 5 .,179
12Xpert,but difference with wocs and maxi's draws stuff as i understand his systems to be is that wocs was developed with a priori thinking (pinnacle prices are wise) which could then be tested with data. trawling data until you find combinations of things that are profitable is not.,276
12Xpert,which rather begs the question why the media still report the number of cases. globally it is 0 .0 0 3  %  but i already know 1  confirmed case and 5  other probables based on matching symptoms and i'm billy-no-mates with a social sphere barely touching 3  figures.,265
12Xpert,worst case scenario is that it keeps mutating (like flu)  it's harder to manage with annual vaccine upgrades  the new strains have higher mortality rate in which case we're going to have to have a new relationship with death if we don't want to iteratively destroy our economy.,277
12Xpert,"however this is dealt with the end game is herd immunity whether via a faster but socially devastating ""do nothing"" strategy or a slower ""destroy the global economy and wait for a vaccine"" strategy. this is precisely how things like flu and measles are managed. take your pick.",277
12Xpert,"tell me how i can do that. i still don't know how you do that. ""improve chances of success"" does not equal ""lose less"". it does not mean ""being lucky"". it means having positive expected value.
the word ""improve"" implies causation. how can i cause anything in roulette?",268
12Xpert,public healthcare systems will suffer if a nation's economy contracts by 5  % . have you modelled which outcome would be worse for public health after the whole thing is played out? presumably we must believe experts have done the modelling. i wonder what the outcome variance is?,280
12Xpert,"on the second point i said: ""there will be times when the bookmaker takes a position on some action.""

i would assume it's most of the time. but the 'not caring' what happens' idea can be applied to samples if not to individual markets. it still make sense.",257
12Xpert,it raises the age old question: what is more important quantity or quality? would you rather have an increased life expectation of 1  month (and a 1  %  chance of it ending now) if that means giving up 1 2  months of regular behaviours that are fun things?,256
12Xpert,"yes and what percentage of players manage to get the +ev according to this model of price discovery?

the vast majority of people can be reasonably good at tennis. almost no one can be good at winning tennis contest. this is the difference between absolute and relative skill.",276
12Xpert,in fact it was thinking about whether some people were more able than others to forecast the future that led me to embark on this journey of investigating skill and luck in betting. can some people be disposed with a natural intuition for betting? i still dont know.,266
12Xpert,"just as for pre game its about are you winning more bets/trades than the odds say you should be winning.

its always just about value whatever kind of trade youre making and whatever market. closing line value is just a set of words to describe a particular instance.",267
12Xpert,appreciated. that was also my intention: to cut through the bullshit. that why i started the tipster proofing - to find out if any of them really had what they were selling. this time i make not apology if people don't like the message i'm giving about tipsters.,262
12Xpert,well that could simply be the effect that tax evader is taking about. 7 9  %  to 8 0  %  gives an o/c ratio of 1 .0 1 2 7 . 1 9  %  to 2 0  %  gives an o/c ratio of 1 .0 5 2 6,175
12Xpert,"i've been thinking a lot about the betting content out there at the moment (some good some not so good). so i decided to do a thread of articles from  that i think all bettors should read.

bookmark them. share them. share this. its all about empowering bettors..",263
12Xpert,christ mark you're not allowed freedoms like that. the maverick minority says so. what a shame that the inuits can't do the same and order the rest of the world to stop polluting this planet by doing things like driving trucks. i mean ffs what a reprehensible activity.,269
12Xpert,whether it's unfair depends on your point of view. parts of the christian church regarding taking property off other through application of superior wisdom as a form of fraud. if you then randomise the contest so only chance operates they consider that to be the work of satan,276
12Xpert,no your contribution on this thread so far is worthless. obviously pinnacle would never reveal to me or anyone else how they evolve their prices. i've just attempted to offer some thinking about it to see where it might lead. all you've offered is a bit of comedy.,264
12Xpert,and how do you know that gambling causes harm? have you determined that the direction of causality is like this or whether it might be certain psychological dispositions a small percentage of people have that cause them to gamble but if they could they would find another harm.,277
12Xpert,are hoping to win and knowing you will lose mutually exclusive or can people hold both thoughts at the same time? if the answer to this question is they are mutually exclusive which i think is the crux of your beef against squares then casino gambling shouldn't happen.,269
12Xpert,"just on a point of information ""the growing number of individuals making a living from betting"" does not imply it has become easier only that more people are playing in betting markets. if the market structures stay the same the percentage of winners will stay the same too.",274
12Xpert,but intuition says they must exist. surely closing lines are more efficient then opening ones right? they are and this is how we can see them. plot shows the actual (fair odds) returns for each opening to closing line ratio (samples are to a 3  significant figure resolution).,276
12Xpert,"there are different kinds of sharp as you well know. we both know the version we are talking about.

and then there is complete bs from bookmakers looking to attract more customers by selling the image that you can win if you bet. much like their jackpot stories.",263
12Xpert,"the gc have told me that ""[d]ue to the small number of operators who provided information for this study it should not be assumed that it is representative of the wider online gambling industry.""

but with the  headline written as it is that is exactly what it does.",266
12Xpert,the justification of the winner will be that (s)he doesn't directly cause the loss for the loser. the link is passive. as such it's a standard response to variants of the trolley problem. of course it doesn't stack up because if no-one gambled there would be gambling losers.,275
12Xpert,"i remember when i took a pasting over calling the bitcoin bubble just before it crashed 8 5  % .

it's two people who understand that gambling has far more winners than losers by its design versus thousands who may be suffering from overconfidence and denial about that.",270
12Xpert,fair point. i'm just not interested enough to try it. my honest review would say fi looks interesting and has a lot of merit but it worries me that current profiting by majority of customers may drive an overconfidence in their own abilities and understanding that isn't merited.,279
12Xpert,yes new account from a new customer the bookmaker knows nothing about. that's the point. would the sharp book move a line in response to their max stake bet in a low volume market? we can only speculate because we don't know the trading decisions of the bookmaker.,264
12Xpert,it's ironic. identity shouldn't even come into it. on paper he's the best candidate but labour have spent the past 5  years making so much about identity that the cognitive dissonance they will suffer over who to choose because of that will be self consuming. all self made.,274
12Xpert,wasn't really thinking of addiction. more that people are entitled to spend their money how they want having a good time whether playing roulette on a night out or going on holiday both which can elicit emotions of excitement/fun. who is anyone else to judge whether it's stupid,278
12Xpert,not a lot to be honest. if traditional bettors cared about this sort of market they'd already be share dealing. i suspect the two worlds of sports betting and financial markets are still as separate as they ever were probably propagated by the anti-gambling class war from iyis.,278
12Xpert,but that's the point. as a degenerate gambler it's not particularly beneficial for me to be reading the  if i'm targeted with ads from gambling firms seen on their website. perhaps the paper needs to reassess what ads it shows to ensure that's in line with their ethics.,270
12Xpert,it is an interesting model and we shouldn't let preconceived ideas about 'gambling is bad' get in the way of testing it in some way if that's what society wants to do. lots of people like  got upset about brexit but the societal majority wanted to test it.,256
12Xpert,that's not to say we should give up trying to 'fix'. but we should be aware to unintended consequences of trying to do so. for example forcing cyclists to wear head gear (i choose to btw) might increase coronary heart disease because fewer people will want to cycle.,266
12Xpert,february to september 2 0 0 5  from memory at bwin poker.  happy to lay you odds you'll see the same everywhere else. any relative skills contest where compounding of advantage is relevant will exhibit this. as einstein said compounding is the most powerful fore in the universe.,279
12Xpert,does that mean there could be much more than 0 .1  %  or 1  %  of the total? it could. hopefully if i can pull it together and they're willing to publish it next month's pinny article from me will look at a way of (g)estimating the figure.,239
12Xpert,+z for actual  expected -z for actual  expected. my contention is that if clvh is valid this distribution of scores would be normal about a mean of zero. if that proves to be the case it implies there must be special circumstances that apply to tipsters like nish.,264
12Xpert,i actually think a ban on the use of credit cards wouldn't be a bad idea. but arguably that could be extended to much greater regulation of their use more generally in society to reduce the risk of personal debt and the consequences that this can lead to.,255
12Xpert,"it's this sort of ""journalism"" which makes it easy to label  a moral crusader. it might well be the case that big stakers are more likely to be addicts but let's see the data before passing implicitly moral judgements which encourage mps to shoot their mouths off.",264
12Xpert,here's data from my old skybet affiliate acccount (at the time i downloaded it there were 8 5 7  players. 5 0  %  of net revenue comes from 3 .6  %  of them. i think the sample size will be broadly representative of the wider player population.,244
12Xpert,if the argument that bookmakers want to fleece addicts for their shirt is valid (questionable but go with it here) then it would stand to reason that they would make every effort not to restrict customers by mistake in the hope the will bag players like this.,259
12Xpert,the problem is that with both pinny and exchange equally efficient but not perfectly so for every price betting one when the other is lower may mean you are systematically betting the less accurate price on average hence the expected value is illusory only. (2 /2 ),265
12Xpert,it might seem unrigorous to me and you but these brands particularly those answerable to shareholders are in the business of maximising profit. hence they will run a tight ship and do things properly. if traders were found to be making poor decisions well what would happen?,274
12Xpert,"main leagues fixtures for 2 6 th and 2 7 th december available:

i've omitted 2  friday evening fixtures (besiktas v genclerbirligi and dundee utd v dundee) since these are part of the next round of weekend games and they will be available as normal friday pm.",260
12Xpert,"this to understand what ""winner"" means.
it means a bettor with profitable expectation expected value positive alpha etc not profits. as i keep reiterating to be a successful bettor you need to forget about the results and look at the methods of how you achieve expected value",275
12Xpert,"not sure i'd agree it's anti-capitalist. also not sure that gambling is not in the best interests of society. that's typically an argument made by those who don't like it and aren't interested in considering the benefits. reminds me of ""brexiters are like turkeys voting for xmas""",280
12Xpert,this actually isn't news anymore rather i imagine the times have joined the  in an anti gambling moral crusade. bets are always consensual and if one side refuses to take action from another that's their right no matter how annoying it might seem to a skilled punter.,267
12Xpert,"either you beat the line or you've already been restricted elsewhere and bookmakers are very good at sharing data about such things with each other.

i've been refused a 1 st bet. i've had another account closed after 1  bet. beat the line (closing odds) you're done.",267
12Xpert,this strategy is nothing to do with pinnacle. it's simply wisdom of the crowd at soft books. it's inferior to mine because it uses the average of soft book odds to then find outliers. far better to use a sharp book like pinnacle to do that job.,244
12Xpert,"listening to bbc now. ""all i heard on the doorsteps is how is this going to be paid for how is this going to hurt my business?"" there's your distrust.
""sort out our views on the economy.""
""present ourselves as a world stage player""
""deal with antisemitism.""",257
12Xpert,i don't necessarily buy the narrative that bj will usher in an uncaring right wing government. he has shown himself to be socially liberal in the past for example voting against ids on lgbt issues in parliament. londoners obviously liked him enough to re-elect him as well.,273
12Xpert,yeah i know. i was merely querying whether there would really by anything wrong with that. obviously if the motive is to attract more customers to make more profit it would be questionable but if the motive was more educational then i wouldn't necessarily rule it out.,268
12Xpert,"i don't spit on people who have proved themselves to be capable of delivering persistent +ev. almost all people who call themselves ""tipsters"" aren't able to do that so i reserve the right to show people this reality. if you have a problem with that too bad.",258
12Xpert,obviously we measure premier league greatness by the number of titles and man united walks away with it. but here's the league table for best ever consecutive 3 8 -game points total in the premiership (so relegated and re-promoted teams carry over with the relegated period omitted),282
12Xpert,i do suspect more recently there may be an additional player effect in which players have basically downed tools and refuse to play for the current manager for whatever reason. again a problem created by too much money in football (has led to too much player/agent power).,272
12Xpert,it will have been a tweet and i would guess it would have been to show that betfair racing starting prices would be efficient. you're probably thinking of the bookmaker favourite-longshot bias which ensure punters have a much smaller  %  loss at shorter odds than longer odds.,276
12Xpert,or rather i should say for the reason that is the basis of this silly conspiracy attacking the bbc because their narrative doesn't suit those who are anti johnson in the same way that the right endlessly criticise the bbc for a left bias. it's all pathetic.,257
12Xpert,in the short-term variance can make a losing system look good or a winning system look like a loser. any system needs significant testing. often traders can't wait to ensure validity for fear of missing out or that the markets will correct and expectancy goes to zero.,268
12Xpert,"actually there is:

click on ""sports trading articles"" you will see a list of article sections. on each of those you can see a list of articles and they will show who the original publisher is e.g. pinnacle. at bottom of article you will find the author.",254
12Xpert,thats such a bullshit line. what does consensus mean? ordinarily you would stick your house on this if you could be bothered to wait but theres always a chance the bookmaker takes a different view on the meaning of the word to yours. scientific consensus? trump voters?,269
12Xpert,i have had some lively debates with j4 p and we dont agree on everything but i thought this was reasonably fair and balanced. they are definitely not prohibitionists and want a sustainable industry - i think industry should engage with them ideally in person/phone not twitter,276
12Xpert,i believe it was ronald fisher who first introduced the 5  %  level and groupthink has meant that this convention has stuck even amongst many scientists. quantum physicists take a more serious view on this and insist on 5  sigmas about 1  in 3  million i think.,261
12Xpert,"exactly i just don't get the concept. it just seems to be ""here's a bet from a pro go bet it at a soft book and get restricted"" so i'm not seeing how it's better than what's already available by way of tipsters for average joe punter.",234
12Xpert,as previously mentioned it was an error on my part forgetting to upload. by the time i realised the matches had already played. the results data for those 4  english games are there and the weekend fixtures will be available friday as normal. apologies for the confusion.,271
12Xpert,sorry jeff but that's just crap. if you hate his politics deconstruct them. i imagine his children wouldn't like seeing this. it's this sort of shit endlessly filling social media that slow divides a nation. why don't you give him a hug instead of wishing he died.,264
12Xpert,so do the experiment. collect a load of high-iq bettors who are all doing the things you say are needed to deliver 7  %  yield from 5 0 -5 0  handicaps. then follow their performances over thousands of bets. then report back their distribution of t/z scores.,258
12Xpert,"thereafter until the end of the 2 0 1 8 /1 9  season (7 1 0 7  matches) this is what would have happened. -7 .3 9  % .

2 0 0 0  bets is still a small sample. considerably bigger that this will be as well.",205
12Xpert,"or as keynes would put it: markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
isnt this the problem with greed? its not just the seller who is either mis-selling or simply blind to his overconfidence. its also the buyers irresponsible attitude to risk and money.",273
12Xpert,you might well say obviously that will never happen. perhaps thats because there just arent enough people who care as passionately as you do even though they may say they do. when push comes to shove having monday night football is more important that worrying about stokes,273
12Xpert,not that i'm trying to detract from your points daniel it's just that if we always bash gambling as an intrinsically evil thing we miss out on the possibility of helping with many of society's other problems which aren't a million miles away from gambling with money.,267
12Xpert,yours is a much smaller sample and no futures events (might make a difference). i agree that log method always seems to lead to positive yields for 2 -way markets (so probably over estimating strength of f-l bias) but in my sample other methods were bigger negatives.,267
12Xpert,"furthermore once your ""skill"" has seen off losing players you'll need more to come to the platform to make your model for making a living work. of course maybe losers will carry on playing and losing forever some losing their shirts along the way. happy with that?",264
12Xpert,not quite. the backstop effectively separates ni from uk and that is something no sovereign nation should ever be forced to sanction by a political entity that is not a sovereign nation. perhaps the eu should become such a thing (maybe it will) but again another story.,269
12Xpert,brilliant. citizen kane  blocked me for asking him to define soon in this reply to my tweet about impending eu recession. he asked why he should define it and i said because i asked him to and that without a timescale its easy to claim predictive success.,255
12Xpert,i've been working on a makeover of a shot metrics chart i'd posted in the past. still too early in the season for meaningful averages but any comments/suggestions on the layout formatting etc would be appreciated. e.g. do the numbers help or are they surplus? legend? colours?,276
12Xpert,accuracy isnt bad at all. i looked at outcome predictions of all ucl group stage matches in the last 3  seasons compared to  and bookmakers odds using briers score. some of their rating looks a bit odd to me but they do a fairly good job overall,245
12Xpert,"""there's a  $ 1 0 0  bill on the ground!""
""can't be. if there was somebody would have already picked it up.""

regards fading what makes people believe any systematic bias betting against the square money sits outside of the vig boundaries? (see the economist's joke above.)",273
12Xpert,i mixture of greed and overconfidence greases the wheels of touting. almost none do anything other than chance. almost all and the customers who throw money at them believe that can't be true. when i show them the data cognitive dissonance takes root from which denial blossoms,277
12Xpert,just as an aside the highest profit margin where consumers are failing to act rationally that i can think of is the lottery for which there is numerous advertising that doesnt seem to attract the same level of negative stigma. is that because it is for charity?,261
12Xpert,good for you for staying strong. all of us suffer mental disorders in different ways including saying stupid things on tv to garner attention. but lets celebrate the debate that springs from different opinions and recognise that people have reasons for why they say what they say,279
12Xpert,this is better news. probably no connection with the dumping of affiliates more likely the general malaise with the perception of gambling in the uk but a little bit of me likes to think that you reap what you sow so i won't be shedding any tears.,247
12Xpert,this is better news. probably no connection with the dumping of affiliates more likely the general malaise with the perception of gambling in the uk but a little bit of me likes to think that you reap what you sow so i won't be shedding any tears.,247
12Xpert,georg cantor went mad thinking about different infinities. let's not go there. let's just agree that if you would bet finite  $  against liverpool winning and would find yourself in an emotional state of preferring liverpool to lose you are not a proper fan as defined here.,274
12Xpert,oh this firm has no morality at all. they ruined the business of many affiliates who spent years promoting their brand in the space of 4  weeks claiming bad affiliates presented too much liability but still continue to work with the very worst of those affiliates today..,271
12Xpert,for those who remember my comparison last week of five-thirty-eight's football 1  times 2  prediction model versus pinnacle closing prices here it is again this time against pinnacle opening prices. a similar story. again actual returns are calculated as if assuming 5 3 8  is a bookie.,286
12Xpert,"the book i wrote about the story was ""how to find a black cat in a coal cellar: the truth about sports tipsters"". very few of the tipsters were intentionally and knowingly cheating (e.g. changing results) but many were clueless about their own (lack of) forecasting abilities.",276
12Xpert,it's still 2 1  %  with 1 0 0 0  bettors (5 1 3 /4 8 7  or worse leaves bookie exposed). so the conclusion has to be that the bookie with small margins will often be exposed on one side on a bet by bet basis.,208
12Xpert,the problem with my work in proving their efficiency implies that i know how they do it but i don't so when i get things that look like efficient it could be that my guess is close to what they do and they really are efficient or...,232
12Xpert,thanks tony that's really helpful and glad you've considered my feedback. genuinely interested to see if this campaign proves effective. i'm not an addiction expert and neither am i an addict so perhaps what i think is not relevant here i just felt uncomfortable with the ads.,276
12Xpert,of course prediction models use past results but that is a slightly different topic. what i think james is referring to is the error of placing too much emphasis on single outcomes to prove the model was correct. betting has far to much randomness to allow that.,262
12Xpert,that's certainly true. but if in the end neither of them are as good as the pinny implied predictions at market closure what's the point of them? no goo for making money. what else might they be good for? page filler for  certainly. is there anything else?,256
12Xpert,"the elimination of squares is a thought experiment that is all.
you just want this to be true. you haven't presented any data to back up ""single figure number"". skybet quote 4  %  as being restricted. this picture suggests it's very likely smaller at a sharp book.",264
12Xpert,since we'll never know which matches will see new information which will move against 5 3 8  and which will support it it becomes a random exercise. i suppose this has always been my general warning to bettors. news is random (by definition it has to be).,255
12Xpert,i just read the above and you wouldn't even need to match anything if you check per competition. just calculate rps / brier / whatever for pinny vs 5 3 8 . 5 3 8  also publishes some stuff on methodology and own results as well:   and,234
12Xpert,that's a shame because it's looks pretty comprehensive. it's similar with gracenote's i think. i really don't know why they don't test against the market since this is the best measure of whether it's better than (most of) the rest. otherwise why should anyone pay any attention,278
12Xpert,"if you want but you're wasting your time. the bookmaker's margin will kill you. and don't confuse mean regression with ""what goes up must come back down"". it's actually what goes up has a tendency to come back down. so many misunderstand the distinction.  e.g. gambler's fallacy",278
12Xpert,naturally but they'll never tell you what the answer is because that would reveal information about whether they do in fact move odds in response to volume and/or sharpness. we have to try to find ways of figuring out what they do indirectly and that's not easy.,262
12Xpert,as this is precisely the problem. you need to have an a priori reasons for expecting something to happen then test the data to see if that thing actually happens the way you said it would. technical analysis and charting doesn't do that that's why it's flawed.,260
12Xpert,"i'm guessing that this is because the monte carlo and  calculator uses the same odds for every bet but the actual ""record"" had much more variable odds. ""record"" is shown in quotes because we're not really talking about a record here are we really just a pattern",261
12Xpert,the standard deviation in odds movement method is sound you can confirm it easily via monte carlo. i suppose the only explanation where my thinking falls down would be if the distribution of the margin shifted between the two price times but that would make no sense.,267
12Xpert,and if that doesn't work as it doesn't for the common cold (but at least that doesn't kill) then the world will have face up to the realisation that it has a new disease that it will have accept and readjust its relationship with living and dying.,247
12Xpert,suppression has no exit strategy ian. waiting for a vaccine which may never come (there isn't one for the other coronaviruses) because covid-1 9  might mutate into 2 0 0  different varieties like the common cold isn't feasible. vaccine or no vaccine end game is herd immunity.,276
12Xpert,"we don't have true figures from anyway. think about how many people you know (your dunbar number) and how many of them you know have got it or had it. the scale up.

the figures for all age demographics will be lower than what is being reported.",245
12Xpert,no you didnt. those make me less losing not more winning. you may try to argue that relatively speaking they are the same. im saying that even the use of the word winning when used with the word strategy and not the word luck is totally irresponsible.,251
12Xpert,both sides of this polarised debate talk such a lot of bs because they unwittingly (or deliberately?) confuse sex and gender. the former is defined by the size of the gamete. the latter is a social construct influenced but not exclusively defined by the former. who cares.,272
12Xpert,obviously clv has no relevance to in-play trading in the strictest sense. but the concept of value still applies. as in any arb one side must contain a theoretical value greater than the lack of value in the other side. the same is true with in-play trading.,258
12Xpert,if there is finite probability of ruin (e.g. death) it pays to massively overestimate probability of it happening. once upon a time we were chased by lions. in an evolutionary context the successful (rational) strategy was to assume it was a lion even though sometimes it wasn't.,279
12Xpert,"ok watson i've found:




the 1 st was closed for spamming.
the 2 nd has just 7 9  picks.
the 3 rd has 7 5 1  picks and a level stakes yield of 0 .3 4  % 

elementary. you are a serial tipster spammer who rinses  repeats",220
12Xpert,im just asking you to be clear about why you tipped a shitty bulgarian softbook no one has heard of when you lecture me about limits and limitations. youve said you dont and its the verification that cheats by changing it. so lets see what they say.,249
12Xpert,yes i've heard of him. betting is a lot more like stockpicking than dentistry. i've seen the data evidently you haven't because you just live in your world of 1  (sorry 2 0 ). and gary klein would tell you that not that you appear to understand.,245
12Xpert,to give  his due i actually used to think the same. most of what i had read was utterly useless just rants from so-called gambling celebrities or examples of rating systems that were sold as winners but when tested with larger data samples proved to be worthless.,263
12Xpert,presumably intellectual remain voters will welcome covid-1 9  because it has the potential to cut carbon emission via a mass population cull. and given that will mostly mean the elderly this would kill off all those stupid old gammons who should die anyway because of their views.,280
12Xpert,i guess so far i've been lucky (or clever depending on you point of view). annualised growth of about 1 0  % . not as good as wb but better than the average stock market and certainly better than bank interest since 2 0 0 6 .,225
12Xpert,for the most part i'll still hold them. it's a 3 0  year strategy. i took the view from the outset that i would target markets that i thought were higher variance but also had a long term potential: tech biochemicals healthcare chinese consumers electronics green energy.,271
12Xpert,lets see how things look in 1 2  months. they already look different to predictions made last year by remainers (boris wouldnt get a deal) and radically different to bank of england projections about house prices jobs and earnings made for the 2  years following the vote.,272
12Xpert,as youve discovered its not really suited for larger numbers of runners. yuu can even get negative odds in extreme cases for 1  times 2 . for books with more runners look up the shin method for margin application/removal. it probably much closer to what bookmakers do.,268
12Xpert,i know ill be told it works in rugby. well good for you. in comparison rugby doesnt matter not enough people care about it. and given its already unintelligible rules to the average viewer video decisions on tries make little difference. football is beautiful for it simplicity,277
12Xpert,naturally we can then say that humans can still rule on how it should be interpreted. but that will still throw up the same type of debates about uncertainty. the fallacy was ever believing var could remove this uncertainty. all it does is push it somewhere else.,263
12Xpert,yes clearly. to a microscope. clearly a stupid bit of technology if every time there's a goal you don't actually know if it's a goal until a bit of tech kit says it is. we might as well be playing fifa 2 0 . what's the point?,225
12Xpert,sports will be next. then when pgs turn to forex and day trading they'll go after those markets too. but pgs are like criminals: always one step ahead. and addiction is like crime: f you want to solve it deal with the causes don't prohibit the effects.,252
12Xpert,i think you'll probably find that the real moral outrage is about gambling in general and pgs are just a convenient weapon to signal virtue about it. besides it's still not at all clear that the prohibitions have correctly separated pareto principle from intent to screw pgs.,275
12Xpert,i certainly think there are issues over what recreational bookmakers are allowed to do by contract law but people who bet shouldn't lose sight of the fact that if they are allowed to win someone else (and not the bookmaker) will have to be paying for that.,256
12Xpert,for sure you'll tell me there could be hidden biases within those that cancel out. i've already conceded that could be true e.g. coz of anchoring. but until we have some concrete evidence i prefer to apply the principle of occam's razor. simplest explanation is probably correct.,279
12Xpert,"1 ) taking positions doesn't not imply that the line is intentionally inefficient. it just implies that money hasn't been balanced within the safety of the margin.
2 ) you can shade a line by less than the size of the margin and still increase your profit.",256
12Xpert,when you find uk and european bookmakers offering great prices that can be used in arbs they are systematically on the wrong side. ie they are offering the value whilst pinnacle is not. this is because they are deliberately offering value prices to sell the message they....,274
12Xpert,indeed.. but remember it's easy to be on the right side of the arb relative to a soft book because soft books are intentionally trying to be wrong. all you have to be is efficient in such a case and you'll still be on the right side.,233
12Xpert,certainly for the 0 .7  %  who are affected. but that goes for any addiction whether it be alcohol drugs sex weight loss shopping and so on. it's a physical and mental illness. addiction is basically the utility of trying to stay normal hence it's massively negative-sum.,271
12Xpert,i'm sure you're not. i think the point that was possibly being made is that you rather look down on the stupidity of people who refuse to join you at the exchanges in a similar manner that detractors called things like the lottery at tax on stupidity.,251
12Xpert,you kind of see the same when certain sky sports football pundits mock the concept of xg. humans find it much easier to understand outcomes deterministically rather than probabilistically and who are we to judge if they get a bigger dopamine hit from goals rather than xg.,272
12Xpert,of course in the longer term the financial market is probably still zero (or negative) sum game because humans haven't been very good (or honest) about valuing downsides (waste and pollution for example). on the other hand they've been very good at discounting them to the future.,280
12Xpert,i think youre missing the point. the claim was that the report shows the gambling industrys reliance on problem gamblers. it doesnt. it just shows reliance on the pareto princie. all business relies on that. shops rely on it. does that mean they rely on shopping addiction?,273
12Xpert,just to explain myself a bit more. i am not talking about luck. being lucky can pay handsomely if you have aggressive money management even at a sharp book. but being lucky is not sustainable you can't make a professional living from it lasting years or decades.,262
12Xpert,isn't that the point? it implies it's hard. if you respond by saying hardly any of them are really trying what would happen if they did? it's still the same relative-skills contest. everyone's got better at predicting the true  %  but the number of winners can't change,269
12Xpert,"to even get to the point where you have the sort of knowledge about clv that you have takes years of market familiarity. i'm sure when steve started out he wasn't thinking about clv. like most it would be ""which tipsters look good then i'll follow those.""",255
12Xpert,your argument hinges on them having access to better information. but there are now a lot of modellers with access to the same and sometimes better information. if they shade too much too much sharp money will exploit the position then the squares will follow via anchoring.,274
12Xpert,although this does raise an interesting question: do the norms describing the common (moral) good emerge out of wisdom of crowd forces or a small number of intolerants? i suspect the answer is both to a greater or lesser degree and varies with the domain we're in.,264
12Xpert,in the same way that you can't expect companies to avoid paying tax. their responsibility is to the shareholder not the tax payer. the government's responsibility by contrast is to the tax payer so it's their job to come up with regulation that's fair to both sides.,266
12Xpert,"just to say again for the millionth time today fi is obviously not a ponzi. but it has some explaining to do to account for how it thinks 9 8  %  of its customers don't lose because typically for that to happen require irrational ""castle-in-the-air"" investment thinking.",270
12Xpert,and with no means of short-selling to burst sentiment bubbles that has all the hallmarks of castle-in-the-air investing which is not something i choose to get involved in. fi says only 2  %  of their customers tended to lose with them. that can't happen without irrational sentiment,282
12Xpert,i'm not going to get into this again.  did a good job last night and earlier today and i think he's worn out with it now. if almost everyone is winning that's a sure sign that the foundations which support this concept are not fundamental but psychological.,257
12Xpert,but there is not the same level of irrationality because there is a shorting side to the 1 /1 0  favourite it's the 7 /1  underdog. if punters push the favourite to 1 /1 0 0  and the underdog to 5 0 /1  what's going to happen?,226
12Xpert,"hence largely meaningless for this discussion. it was about evidence pro bettors can look for to tell them that they are skilled.

besides if you're saying that sharps make the price go down (which is what you seem to have said) then that will be their evidence.",262
12Xpert,are you for real mark. i can only draw conclusions from people who claim to be tipsters. that is what pyckio is for. unlike other other useless tipster supermarkets they at least make an attempt to vet performance before permitting the best one to sell their advice.,266
12Xpert,i'm sure they can but i'm also sure they're working hard at it. too many in this game just think it's easy with no hard work required. however you cook this whether your own ingredients or someone else's it takes diligence and perseverance to make this pay.,257
12Xpert,but this implies they are betting soft book markets and passing their restrictions to others. besides i could sell people profitable advice at a soft book i just choose to give it away for free. what's far more interesting is whether anyone can do it at sharps/exchanges,270
12Xpert,"yes if you can be sure that slippage and fees won't completely destroy your profits.  is analysing 2 7  pro tipsters with past ""proven"" success and it's pretty clear that on average they simply mean regress and slippage is too big to make this a justifiable venture.",266
12Xpert,are you sure you're not exhibiting confirmation bias? do you actually have any data on the different ways people typically get into debt? typical quoted reason are job loss and uncontrolled credit spending but with regards the latter there is never any data on what is bought.,276
12Xpert,i think the problem was over screening rights exclusivity. the bookmakers have now relaxed that. the fa will show the matches on their website. if that's for free then they've basically taken the piss selling the rights. if it's not then bookies have the right to undercut.,273
12Xpert,maybe those with more money bet larger stakes. so  argument is made that it doesn't work like that it's addicts who pay more. but this takes us back to position articulated by  in his  piece which seems to me to hinge on secret data and confirmation bias.,255
12Xpert,is that a bad thing? we have this in taxation and in ether socio-economic domains although i know the  doesn't like that. you might well say well in tax those who can afford to pay more pay more. why would that be different with bets on football?,246
12Xpert,with the world upset at bet3 6 5  being allowed to screen fa cup games could someone please explain to me why everyone seems to be so appalled about an apparent intrinsic link between football and betting when it appears to be perfectly acceptable in horse racing.,264
12Xpert,"if their input and the gc's responses doesn't managed to reduce addictive gambling then it's a complete waste of time. arguably if the line was ""we agree that bookmakers should ban 'winners' and it should be legislated they have to tell people"" that might be more effective.",274
12Xpert,but indeed for the 2 7  tipster sample you have seeing only 2  that are significantly different from clv expectation is not a reason to cast off clvh. if it's again not too much trouble can you post the (1 -tailed) p-values for those 2 7  tipsters.,248
12Xpert,how do you know when the market is evolving? you haven't made the case just given some hindsight examples. the only method i know of with respect to one's own betting is looking at your performance against the closing line. but even that is hindsight albeit short.,264
12Xpert,of course you could show my sample is unrepresentative by publishing data from your own representative sample but somehow i suspect it won't be forthcoming. in fact my sample exhibits a weaker power distribution than the bwin data which presumably is population data but hey ho,277
12Xpert,yes that's basically how a market-making or sharp bookmaker operates. i believe it can be the case that some of these brands can offer opening lines to a selected groups of sharp players privately for limited stakes and this helps adjust the line towards greater efficiency.,274
12Xpert,i agree something feels not quite right about refusing action. but writing a story about dc's salary as a means of criticising it rather than looking more analytically at the historical political and economic landscape of sport betting seems to me to be a bit pathetic.,269
12Xpert,why should they not allowed to be? has anyone actually proposed an argument that has more weight than the alternative. simply saying they shouldn't be allowed because it's not right or not fair is a tautology. i don't like it either but is that an argument?,257
12Xpert,for those who are too good for the recreational bookmakers there are always the exchanges. if you are unable to show profitable expected value at exchanges then the value you thought you had at bookmakers was simply because of their charity (in offering loss leading prices).,275
12Xpert,"what is less acceptable is the denial by bookmakers that they restrict ""winners"". of course they allow people to win (via luck) but a little bit of explaining what expected value is would deal with shameful defence. rather recreational books should just admit they do it.",271
12Xpert,we live in strange times indeed. prime minister lies to the queen and is re-elected as prime minister with a landslide.  i think this is what happens when people who feel they've been left behind and ignored are given a chance to have their views heard.,253
12Xpert,"i very much suspect that this distribution is just like betting performances. almost normal (i.e. luck) because there's a 'paradox-of-skill ""arms"" race' going on but there are a few who are geniuses and have real positive and meaningful alpha. i assume messi is in that category.",279
12Xpert,"thanks.
""the consensus in the football analytics community appears to be that finishing skill exists but is only provable given large samples of shots and hence estimation of this skill for individual players is impossible at worst and problematic at best. ""
as i've been saying",278
12Xpert,"interesting stat. any chance you could plot a distribution of ln(goals/xg) for all goal scorers (say with more than 2 0  goals over 3  seasons to reduce variance) and see who the outliers are.
(might messi be an example of xg methodology being a one-size-doesn't-fit-all metric?)",279
12Xpert,"(1 /2 ) obviously not the latter method. for example suppose both figures were 5 /1 0  (0 .5 ). multiplying gives you 2 5  %  which intuitively would not feel correct.
the first method is better but there is a wider issue in following this.",240
12Xpert,if they win that narrative endlessly plugged by the opposition parties will be tested. i'm not fully convinced by it. boris' voting record on social issues is historically quite positive but people have more recently focused on the silly things he has said. time will tell.,273
12Xpert,it's not entirely clearly whether betting markets reflect wisdom of large square crowds or wisdom of small sharp crowds or wisdom of bookmaker's odds compilers. i suspect it's all three to different degrees depending on the size of the market. ai would just be another input.,275
12Xpert,i'm not so much questioning the accuracy of the predictions rather the conspiracist nonsense that the world is run by tories/jews/free masons. i get really sick of listening to people bleat it. sadly it's infected the corbyn labour party and that's why he's being called out.,275
12Xpert,and indeed it's not a revolutionary idea but i've put some maths to it to make it more rigorous. i'm not aware that anyone before me went public about using pinnacle's pre-margin odds to calculate true odds nor how to remove the margin for that purpose.,253
12Xpert,"i have read a lot of political commentary in the past 1 8  months that the age of two-party politics is over. given these trends how wise does that look now?  has informed us that ""expert political judgement"" is an oxymoron (and politics ""experts"" are morons).",260
12Xpert,my attempt at a premiership heat map. don't know if it's any good. measures over/under performance relative to market expectation as defined by closing  1  times 2  odds. score is cumulative for the season. -1  through to -6  are cumulative scores -1  -2  etc matches before.,275
12Xpert,presumably also most of the pros won't really be that skilled. i mean it's not particularly hard to get banned by recreational bookmakers. so non pros will simply be following those wise enough to beat soft books and soon they will find themselves banned too right?,265
12Xpert,if it wasn't very original shame you didn't think of it and make a load of money selling it like  and  i don't doubt there were others who thought of this privately but to my knowledge no one published it. hence i'll take the credit thanks.,240
12Xpert,if it's only faith you're bothered about then i'm told astrology and alchemy are worth following. taleb would probably add economists to that. religion is also worth a look. i believe john chapter 2 0  verse 2 7  has some things to say on the subject.,251
12Xpert,"don't stop there jeff. let's look at the tens of millions at risk of diabetes stroke and heart failure egged on by crap food advertising.

if you'd like to join in with my threads about moral prohibition and the evolutionary motivations behind gambling then please follow.",272
12Xpert,you see. it's just all the same talk. addiction. bad. never balanced. the majority of people who gamble safely don't take prohibitionists seriously because of their prohibitionist stance. if you want people to grow up about financial risk taking you have to be cleverer than that.,280
12Xpert,well of course if youre changing the numbers this changes the numbers which was my point. little point continuing unless i have a real record of wins and losses with odds to look at. but once again thanks for making me think some more about this.,246
12Xpert,instead of trotting out this socio-economical rubbish that conforms to biased moral thinking society would gain so much more if it actually bothered to understand why gambling is part and parcel of human behaviour and what it has to teach by way of judgement under uncertainty.,277
12Xpert,"still only 1 /1 1 3  not 1 /5 0 0 .
but why are we trading insults? with 5 7  %  you're one of the best handicappers in the world. why haven't i heard about you before? and where's my invite to your beach party?",211
12Xpert,"in fact there's about a 1  %  chance you'd be showing a loss after 9 5 4 8  bets with the bets that have taken place just because of bad luck. so ask your self again: ""think you know small sample size; think you understand variance?""",233
12Xpert,yes i've seen this luck-skill continuums. it's not novel. if she has betting far removed from the luck end then i don't agree with her. michael mauboussin has investing much nearer the luck end. betting is no different. both are environments where true probabilities are unknown,278
12Xpert,i mean obviously no one would think themselves sharp for randomly betting on every match but many punters with profits from their clever forecasting systems betting to  closing prices after 1 0 1 8 0  bets would think they were so. how many really would be?,257
12Xpert,if the possession stats are anything to indicate  will have at least 3 0  years to wait if they continue to play 'park the bus' football learnt under mourinho and further indulged by solskjaer. this is not the man united way and their fans know it.,248
12Xpert,tis the greatest irony about socialist remainers. you don't see the eu for what it is a neoliberal capitalist protectionist globalist cabal which is fine by me because i'm not a socialist. if you actually thought this through you'd realise you've more in common with trump,272
12Xpert,"people and fans... are so sick and tired of drugs cheats. they have zero tolerance... so if you... have any connection with anything to do with doping they are done with you and that's just the way it is. athletes need to understand that.
micheal johnson",254
12Xpert,yes that's what's useful about it. i keep saying to nish that we need more than just your record to write off the clvh. 1  tipster who makes sustainable profits without beating the closing price is not sufficient. i need to see lots more doing that.,249
12Xpert,the trouble is that betfair is likely equally efficient to pinnacle so when they hold higher prices my belief is that it's more probable the pinnacle price is more inefficient. and vice versa. would love it if someone has tested this and could report on it.,257
12Xpert,well all i would say is that investing in sports funds is not worth the risk. it's effectively an unregulated market. on top of the difficulty of actually returning a profit long term if they break the law you may still not get your money back.,244
12Xpert,"man u were 3  five times away last season. they won one of those (but they ain't big anymore). man city were never 3 . liverpool were 3 .8 4  away to man city. they lost.

just not enough matches to make this a meaningful sample.",229
12Xpert,your child analogy is interesting. evidently you see certain adults as children that dont understand the consequences of their actions. i see it rather differently. those children as you call them are sick of being patronised about whats good for them by people who face no...,276
12Xpert,well yes but the difference is tiny (as it was for football) so qualitatively speaking i not sure how much it tells me. also i have no reference figure to compare these two figures to. what number would i get if closing price were fully efficient?,247
12Xpert,i've seen people invest in tipster funds who have lost thousands because the 'fund manager' got it wrong and there were no contracts in place to offer any protection and attempt recovery of lost funds. never hand over large sums of money to a 'tipster'. never.,260
12Xpert,that's what they wanted. no other country will want to face it. ultimately it is a doomed project unless it federalises and becomes a single county with single fiscal policy defence strategy etc. etc. see what the germans say when they are faces with that reality.,264
12Xpert,maybe the puppet masters of the eu projects see the eu as a means of expanding the concept of nation to something bigger and a natural progression from tribe  chiefdom  village  town  city  nation and beyond as globalism drives the collective psyche to ever bigger in-groups.,275
12Xpert,it didn't apply on online games. i think lucky's argument is that addicts will simply move there. then you do the same online. they move somewhere else. why not actually debate what it is about gambling that people are drawn to and investigate more sustainable solutions.,271
12Xpert,i think most educated individuals understand perfectly well how the news industry works. its how it works thats the problem. journalists are required to paint the world as a series of black and white truths. it aint like that once you come to really understand uncertainty.,273
12Xpert,don't listen to ex-footballers or journalists with no idea on how to bet on football - listen to experts like greg who have a genuine proven track-record of success betting. read his thoughts on what it takes to make it pay ahead of the new season:,248
12Xpert,first set of 2 0 1 9 /2 0 2 0  main leagues fixtures available (b1  f2  d2 ). you will see some changes. same 1  times 2  odds. added over/under and asian bet3 6 5   pinny.  all maxs/avgs now from oddsportal. number of bookmakers removed.,238
12Xpert,the other side of the anti-gambling argument. as with so many social issues today things are complex and nuanced and no one is served by the extreme polarisation of views that typically occurs. society should have a proper debate about gambling rather than just condemning it.,276
12Xpert,while tipsters like you exist punters will never learn anything. maybe you're right their too lazy to bother. but don't pretend you're somehow holier than thou because i'm affiliate scum and you offer winners. nearly all of your like are f....g useless and are tossing coins.,275
12Xpert,he's making no attempt to show how likely his record can happen by chance assuming his model does nothing. he makes no attempt to show whether it beats closing prices. indeed he even argues closing prices are completely irrelevant. this is not someone who's statistically savvy.,278
12Xpert,as for being bothered by your crowing i try to educate punters that single results indeed even quite large samples of results prove absolutely nothing about what cause them. your boom noises imply you caused them when you have absolutely no idea. punters should understand why,276
12Xpert,there are plenty of opinions in the world of betting but not all of them are worth listening to.  certainly is and i was lucky enough to spend an hour talking to him about his new book and what the future has in store. listen here,230
12Xpert,"yes we like to win but you must ask why. winning offers self confirmation that we are somebody rather than nobody who can predict the future. if you 'know"" what's going to happen arguably your life is doing to be a whole lot easier and safer.",242
12Xpert,the reason he campaigned for remain is because labour wouldnt keep him as leader if he campaigned for leave. he prioritises the end of the tories above brexit hence his fencing sitting and ambivalence as a management strategy to prevent tom watson from growing a spine.,269
12Xpert,in your opinion. and there is always a next time. if you don't suffer consequences you learn nothing. that's why there'll be another major financial crash because bankers weren't punished at least not in the uk. capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses (taleb).,276
12Xpert,but the point is that you don't have to be in the eu to trade freely. it's up to nations to cut off noses for face spiting if they so choose. the eu can decide what's more important: their club rules or free trade and jobs.,223
12Xpert,hence the subjectivity point in the case about whether the rule is a good one worth adhering to. i think clearly the scotland v argentina case illustrates the point. do we want football to become a game decided by techno nerds with a nanometer measuring stick?,260
12Xpert,i hope it's clear to the var refs too. i suspect it won't be but if they all argue it is clear despite contentious decisions i suspect they will sill be arguing precisely what it was that was clear to them. time will tell as always.,232
12Xpert,as a bayesian i'm inclined to ascribe a higher probability to the second of these opinions until such time as data becomes available to suggest that the first is much more likely proving that bookies were actually doing that rather than this being just anecdotal hearsay.,271
12Xpert,yes but the point is they can despite only being able to process one 3 0  millionths of the moves a computer can. so surely that tells you they are doing different things and therefore there are environments where the human brain will outperform the computer.,259
12Xpert,living things like to be in control of their lives. for humans with a complex awareness of self and time (in particular the future) divination soothsaying prophecy prediction and gambling are as natural as a belief in god and for more or less the same reasons.,260
12Xpert,equally maddening is spending half your working life referring thousands of customers to a brand which then pays you a living only to be told out of the blue that your account is being terminated with immediate effect because they reserve the right to do that.,260
12Xpert,i make available fixtures for anyone who does quantitative analysis on historical data to find systems that beat the bookmaker odds. from those systems they will output probability predictions for home draw and away. if those are more than the odds imply you have found value,275
12Xpert,so here i'm pretending  was a bookmaker offering their implied odds. so e.g. if 5 3 8  odds / pinny odds = 1 .1  hpothesis predicts actual roi for a sample of such bets will be 1 .1 . the chart looks pretty convincing to me.,224
12Xpert,perhaps so. i'm not party to the conversation so can't verify who's telling the truth. however i would question why someone with the holy grail who is the best in the world at betting is even wasting their time on twitter. i sure as hell wouldn't.,247
12Xpert,indeed that's basically what i do visually here just without the stats. but still the problem is you are using samples  1  to compare expected with actual. if you do this for individual bets your outcomes are either 0  or 1  and that gets us nowhere.,250
12Xpert,why would you disagree with my paradox of skill argument. suppose all the squares were removed from the game. what would happen? clearly pinny is not going to pay all these sharps their wages given the way they operate their business model. their market would adjust.,267
12Xpert,i don't believe it's that big. that's a figure that's crept into folklore and has no credible evidence to support it.  report that 4  %  of their customers get restricted. but it's not particularly hard to get that accolade at a recreational book setting loss leaders.,268
12Xpert,no idea i don't have the data but you would be a fool to look for anything and believing there was any point to it unless you had previously developed a methodology that could explain why this pattern occurred.. that is the point of this thread.,245
12Xpert,you first popped up suggesting your system cast doubt on clvh. so yes it was my work you were questioning. i wanted to point out that your system didnt do what was being claimed and took the trouble to explain to others why that was so.,236
12Xpert,the bottom line is that for a professional bettor any bet with -ev is a bad bet and shouldn't be placed. maxi's systems are -ev based on nothing but pattern spotting data mining which is basically just alchemy. i would never bet on stuff like this.,248
12Xpert,or you could try the herd immunity route. that's obviously a high variance strategy and may massively backfire in terms of impact to the healthcare system. but presumably you get to the point where lockdowns of any kind are no longer needed sooner rather than later.,266
12Xpert,i'm not criticising the story. i'm not the slightest bit surprised betway have found themselves in this mess given my own experience with them. i'm criticising the author for not asking his paper to remove the ads of brands he believes should have their licence revoked.,270
12Xpert,are you suggesting that the precautionary principle applies because the variance in unknowns of not doing anything are bigger (and hence more dangerous) than the variance in unknowns of shutting down? if so why does that not apply to climate change. some people think it should.,278
12Xpert,"then i'd go further (and apply to the finance industry too) by insisting that tipsters (and financial ""experts"") must inform customers that they should familiarise themselves with variance  that most of what happens in a money market in the short term is a consequence of chance.",279
12Xpert,"value betting = betting odds that have profitable expected value. i can do this just at bookmakers that don't let me. again you make up rubbish about what value betting means.
tipster = someone who gives betting picks to others typically but not exclusively for money.",268
12Xpert,if you're living in a rio favela for example do you think you're going to much care about about much carbon you and your neighbours are emitting and are going to go on marches about it and stopping other people getting on with their daily lives?,245
12Xpert,i haven't said i consider it impossible. i just consider it very very difficult and the more liquid the market the harder it will be (as measured by the percentage of players achieving it). i suppose outrights could well be less liquid. i think  does this.,256
12Xpert,it doesn't. but the start of this thread was to point out how unfair it is that recreational books ban winners whilst (allegedly) targeting losing problem gamblers and a contributor made the point (i think) that there isn't anything much fair about winners taking off losers.,275
12Xpert,so all you have is a shifting of distribution of how money is transferred from customer to vendor such that it become more asymmetric and for those who dislike asymmetric wealth more immoral. so smug store card holders are really just punishing stupid store card holders.,271
12Xpert,hmm i think i've confused myself. i suppose that if odds are lengthening by closing this would imply proportionally less vig goes on the draw at close relative to open. not sure if that means it has proportionally more (or less) vig than home and away.,252
12Xpert,"i think most people who criticize tipsters have lost money following them the ones advocating have had some short term success.
if you have found the holy grail of a winning tipster why would you want others to know about them and eat into your profits?",253
12Xpert,"very good points very well made. 
detractors  professionals also seem to have in common an air of patronising superiority. in the case of the former it's a paternalistic desire to save stupid people from their stupidity and they use words like vulnerable to pretend they care.",276
12Xpert,id suppose so. but shopping addiction even though more prevalent just doesnt seem to tug on the moral heartstrings of paternalistic dictators in the same way gambling manages to. presumably a big louis vuitton shopper would just be someone with a lot of money nothing more.,273
12Xpert,if deviations were easy to find then lots of people would be finding them and exploiting them and then those deviations would disappear. that's why the average market looks efficient even at the scale of smallish samples and why the average bettor is a -ev bettor.,264
12Xpert,what i'm saying is that if you have a population of o/c ratios that is distributed randomly about 1 .0 0 0  it's very very hard to find a randomly picked sample of 1 0 0  of them with an average of 1 .0 5 .,206
12Xpert,maybe the bookmaker simple ignores the square bettors' action for the purposes of adjusting the line. presumably they have to in key markets like over/under. if the 2 :1  betshare is reflected in volume too this implies the bookmaker is ignoring the squares' bias towards over.,277
12Xpert,yes closing lines. doesn't imply there isn't any inefficiency at all. it just implies that at this resolution we can't see it. some matches withing a single point scale might be biased one way and some the other way so as a whole the inefficiencies disappear.,259
12Xpert,if you're talking recreational uk/european books then you're right. i can do it. but you get banned for your troubles. then the work changes to disguising your activity and that's hard too. but if we're talking sharp books you're just wrong. it's definitely not shelf stacking.,277
12Xpert,anyway that's not the point. the point is they are banning more people for being sharp because it is easier to be sharp at a recreational a lot easier. that's because they have more incorrect prices and clearly far more people know how to exploit that.,252
12Xpert,"but you can increase your returns without shading beyond the size of the vig.

i guess there are two ways to solve this conundrum. 1 ) truth drug a bookmaker and get them to tell you. 2 ) set one up yourself and see what happens.",229
12Xpert,but that's the basis of woc. provided errors are non systematic they will cancel out over large samples leaving the signal (fair price). it's cognitive bias that can make these non-systematic but my contention is that these are limited in size i.e. smaller than the vig.,270
12Xpert,i look at the expected points table for the premier league from the excellent  and begin to wonder what is wrong with xg. the idea that  is not even a win and a draw ahead of  is quite possibly the most absurd idea anyone could propose.,236
12Xpert,the industry is far too often the architect of it's own downfall and often deserves the press it gets. in this case and on the premise that the industry is targeting under age players i want to be clear. this story it is simply not true.,237
12Xpert,"for your information i'm not employed by anyone.

and please tell me why asking that journalist supply sources for claims is bordering on laughable?

there has been a data breach. true.
that data breach has been used by the bookmakers to recruit more young gamblers. unproven.",276
12Xpert,of course i'm not suggesting fi is anything like madoff. that latter was a deliberate scam the former obviously is not. but if the concept is built on the same type of sand the outcomes for later investors can end up looking similar. time will tell.,249
12Xpert,i've known of this one for a long time. but what does it tell you when a racing tipster published a long term roi of 3 0  %  when patrick veitch britain's most feared racing punter made his tens of millions with 1 7  % ?,220
12Xpert,i think broadly speaking i agree. but i'd also say more generally there are many other things besides gambling via which people can get themselves into debt. perhaps we should look at banning those too or at least tightening the rules on the use of credit.,256
12Xpert,obviously gambling (as you're defining it) is financially stupid. but i'm sure there's more to gambling than just money. anticipating a reward from an uncertain outcome is hardwired to be fun for nearly everyone. so long as that's not taken to excess i think it's fine.,269
12Xpert,and yet you think you have the right to question my moral integrity? take a look at yourself every time you place a bet and think for a minute what it is you are actually doing. you want others to lose so you can win. period.,225
12Xpert,still trying to understand why it's wrong intrinsically? some arguments have been presented to me today some quite valid some not so valid but many hinge on pre-existing moral positions towards gambling. abusing me as one of those in their pockets is not a serious position.,274
12Xpert,"just before someone informs me that i'll see those ads because of what i do isn't that precisely the point?
maybe gambling addicts don't read the  it's just for sjws who purport to care about them i guess.
perhaps i'm just an overly sceptical (cynical?) bastard.",262
12Xpert,"brilliant. i'm sure nearly everyone won't have the slightest idea what this means 

what would be even more useful (but would require a much bigger sample of pro tipsters) would be to plot a distribution of z scores (number of standard deviations actual is from expected).",272
12Xpert,"it's a class thing inspired by a desire to keep those at that bottom of the socio-economic ladder where they belong refusing them opportunities to get lucky and move up by inventing moral arguments for why they shouldn't try and deceiving them ""we care about you.""",264
12Xpert,ok but that's kind of obvious too. just fits with pareto principle. but that doesn't imply most of skybet's deposits/turnover/profits came from those customers. most of that comes from a few players. there's is published data on this from bwin (2 0 0 5 ).,255
12Xpert,its very hard to answer such a question because you never really know what mean any regression may be moving towards. you could start by seeing if he beats the closing line although depending what markets he bets in this information may not be definitive.,255
12Xpert,as est el mapa de calor de la liga segn sistema de  en azul los equipos que lo estn haciendo mal (fros) y en rojo los que lo estn haciendo muy bien (calor). lo normal es que todos tiendan a la media es decir blancos.,216
12Xpert,that is probably true to a point. but if a book sees a punter taking prices that are best in market and then close shorter it's an immediate warning. compounded if they have information shared from other books that they have already restricted the customer.,257
12Xpert,and let's be clear sharp books will have just as many compulsive big losers as anywhere else. they don't need to encourage people to lose because their model is all about accepting anyone and allowing large stakes really large stakes much larger than recreational books.,270
12Xpert,put it this way... if the bookies changed their model and stopped restrictions theyd have to stop bog extra places and loss leading prices. youd basically end up with the exchange. so which do you want? value and restrictions or no value and no restrictions?,258
12Xpert,in the us origins of bookmaking have often been tied up with crime and corruption hence tax and regulation doesn't really come into it. perhaps given the mafia involvement in the early days this is where the sense of duty (to honour action) arises from.,253
12Xpert,as always a little bit of transparancy from both sides of the argument would work wonders in explaining the status quo with respect to sports betting in the uk instead of denials from bookmakers and moral attacks on high earning ceos from those against gambling.,262
12Xpert,the  could write another article explaining the difference between recreational bookmaker and market maker bookmaker models. the latter is much harder to make work in a high tax regime which is why uk and euro bookmakers follow the former. it's not illegal to do so.,266
12Xpert,if i read this table correctly it implies your clv has increased as youve had more bets such that in the last 8 0 0  bets its closely matching your overall performance. isnt this indicative of pinnacle gradually taking notice and is confirmation of clvh?,254
12Xpert,it doesn't have to be the opening line. any line will do so long as it's relative to the closing line with juice removed from both lines. surely you agree with that. this after all is how you calculate clv in the first place right?,231
12Xpert,i'd just like to point out that bookmakers will easily defend against the accusation that they ban winners because lots of their customers do action win by being lucky and those will (almost) never be banned. it's customers with positive expected value who are banned.,268
12Xpert,brexit seems better to some marxism to others. but let's be clear. brexit won't stop immigration. it won't even change the levels. that's all bullshit. but social engineering and wealth redistribution can't be paid for by the top 5  % . that's all bullshit too.,261
12Xpert,you may notice that the shape of the distribution goes a bit funny at extreme values and looks like the area under the curve is 1  this is the unfortunate side effect of using discrete data points to model what is essentially a continuous distribution.,252
12Xpert,the proof of whether anyone can show sustained positive expectation in goal scorer / correct score / scorecast markets is whether any accounts have been closed betting these markets. personally id be surprised since bookmakers push these markets for a reason and its not charity,278
12Xpert,i imagine length of managerial tenure is quasi-pareto distributed and hence doing a simple linear regression like i did is not the appropriate method to form valid conclusions. however i still suspect that however we do it we'll still find them agreeing with our intuition.,273
12Xpert,i certainly think placing employees at the heart of a company as corbyn has suggested is a good idea. this increases stakeholder ownership and encourages more sharing of risks. skin in the game is the best way to encourage people to do the right thing.,252
12Xpert,both would have serious cascading consequences which would also have to be modelled. given that things in nature typically follow the path of least resistance then one significant consequence would be a flight of business and capital to cheaper places. but paul can model it.,275
12Xpert,"i'll ask mine again since i don't recall ever seeing the answer the last time.

what is your expected roi and what is the probability of seeing the actual returns you have seen with jambos assuming your expected roi is correct and you've been unlucky?",251
12Xpert,the odds in these analyses are fair closing lines so evidently the approach is beating them. the question is whether it's systematic (a real bias/inefficiency) or whether it's just random. i'm still in favour of the former but admit if it's real it's very weak.,261
12Xpert,obviously the samples are too small to tell anything but the tipster in question appears to have lost faith. eventually i expect these records will be deleted so paying homage to the religion that all tipsters live by - survivorship bias frequently followed by reincarnation.,275
12Xpert,as for pro punters yes survivorship bias might be an issue. so probably will paradox of skill. the more opportunities that are created to allow more skilled punters to trade the more likely it is that their skills will cancel out leaving just random noise.,256
12Xpert,no that would be my explanation. perhaps then we need a tipster supermarket uses monitors odds slippage as a measure of skill (assuming you believe in clvh an idea i also been heavily criticised over). advertised tipsters could then be bought by single individuals. .,267
12Xpert,timeline showing the 2 0 1 9 -2 0   title race based on my predictions (method at ). my head tells me  are more likely than  but the data say otherwise (and that's kind of the point). this will be updated every week. data by,224
12Xpert,"the notion that gambling can have any benefit has been completely lost in the debate. all that is discussed is degrees of harm which is ridiculous.

it is a complete misrepresentation of the situation. the majority voice is not heard anymore. that has to change.",262
12Xpert,it would be true say that that the moral prohibition against gambling has often come from the institutionally better off (those intellectual yet idiots) telling the poor that they shouldn't gamble since they just might overtake those iyis trying to keep them in their place.,274
12Xpert,i fear you are still going to resist this conclusion but it's pretty clear to me. if you are seeing things you think you shouldn't see then it is almost inevitable that you don't have what you think you have i.e. 5 7  % .,221
12Xpert,using poisson regression i estimated attack/defence parameters for all teams in the big 5  competitions in 2 0 1 8 /2 0 1 9  and then estimated goals home and away. the graphs show the draw probability comparison between poisson bookmakers odds dixon-coles and actual,267
12Xpert,"i've rejected nothing and nobody that has been presented to me an properly scientific rigorous matter. i will reject people like you that just vomits anecdotal nonsense like ""you have to include him because he was good."" do some fucking science or just fuck off.",262
12Xpert,you behave as if you believe you think betting is not almost completely random because you and a private group you know have made some money. have you actually bothered to count all the players and study their performances? not just the ones you see.,250
12Xpert,data was 2 0 1 4 /1 5  to 2 0 1 9 /2 0  english prem champ leagues 1   2 . matches with red cards removed. an expected slight bias against away teams but they foul more since on average they have less possession.,212
12Xpert,"indeed. to emphasise this point here are the rolling 2 6 7 -match (1  season) average moneyline blind betting yields for home and away teams back to 2 0 1 4 . significant periods of lucky profits. sample size is just too small.
data from",237
12Xpert,your customer care is still not fit for purpose. have asked repeatedly for your affiliate team to reply to me regarding non payment of affiliate revenue. still silence on all fronts. how long will it take? or should i just expect to be ignored forever?,252
12Xpert,if you're a freshman reading this for god's sake don't be persuaded by the crazy win percentages. they aren't possible. don't ever imagine they are. 5 7  %  is about the best for their markets. this tells you all you need to know about why:,240
12Xpert,presumably qatari government want the self promotion for their nation and iaaf want the most possible money. fans and athletes are not considered. personally i think it's similar for a lot of us tennis atp/wta tournaments which often have mostly empty stadia for early rounds.,276
12Xpert,as in financial markets after costs are taken into account the whole exercise of professional advice is one of coin tossing (on average). can you tell me if the difference between expected and pre cost pre slippage actual profit is significant. has implications for clvh.,271
12Xpert,not beyond what's discussed in this thread. betfair volume weighted prices for racing are highly efficient. of course we are talking on average here. clearly some prices will contain errors but unless you have a crystal ball it's very hard to know where they are.,263
12Xpert,the suns treatment of stokes and his family is presumably shameless although because ive refrained from bothering to find out what its all about to respect their privacy theres a degree of assumption on my part. what this doesnt need is politicians threatening to decide...,273
12Xpert,...because the establishment calling voters stupid will always be ok they face no risk. leave voters face big risks. the majority are socioeconomically poorer and working class and will more readily live and die by their decisions. they arent going to pay attention to an...,274
12Xpert,"ah right. so when money is nudging that's bad being as it is inevitably subversive but when jc and other 'well-meaning' politicians are nudging that's good?

this also rather assume that people are too stupid to realise the are being nudged. obviously you're an exception.",272
12Xpert,nish won't know if his edge disappears if he doesn't use the closing line to test it. however using the clvh to test one's edge depends on efficiency. if efficiency is lacking (which it might be in tennis) then it bring its use into question.,242
12Xpert,do it other way round so close/open. you get a flat line no correlation. for all close/open ratios your returns are the same a loss equal to their margin. this implies relative to closing prices opening prices are inefficient and contain no additional useful information.,271
12Xpert,affiliates do not change the quantity of money lost they just take some of the share off bookmakers as payment for advertising them. if you're going to make a moral argument against gambling the start with the bookmakers and the bettors that make it happen.,257
12Xpert,but it's the unintended consequences that are far more difficult to model. the economy is a complex system like the climate. it's why prediction scenarios often prove to be way off the mark. at least climate scientists understand error a bit better than political ones.,269
12Xpert,what's the point of talking about limitations if they then don't abide by them. here's an example. here's their shock and severe shock scenarios for sterling. presumably that's some kind of attempt at error margin. so what actually happened was 5  %  beyond severe shock.,271
12Xpert,that might also be the case. which was the point of my initial retweet. there are those (at the guardian and amongst the current labour party in particular) who view gambling as a moral evil in all forms and are waging a war against it.,236
12Xpert,not quite. f1 0  tells you the probability that what you put in g1 0  will be exceeded (right tail) by chance assuming f3  is your expectation. f9  will tell you the probability that what you put in g9  will fall below it (left tail).,234
12Xpert,their way of doing politics is globalist: wisdom of the educated elites rather than wisdom of the dumb peasants. hasn't taleb taught us that globalist politics works fine until it's shocked by black swans at which point its fragility is exposed and lives are wrecked.,267
12Xpert,we live in an age of polarised truths: religious political moral environmental. ive always found this kind of absolutism obscene. am i being absolutist in my intolerance to intolerance? perhaps. but im not so arrogant to assume that i know the truth about complex systems.,272
12Xpert,not only is this incredibly patronising but it also misses the irony that the thousands of employees who may now lose their jobs are also some of the most socioeconomically deprived individuals. but so long as gambling is considered 'evil' then this will be justified.,268
12Xpert,i think the argument here would be that people indulging in cfds are educated players probably with wealth and if they fcuk up so be it whereas old school gambling like visiting bookies preys on the socioeconomically poorest who are least able to help themselves.,263
12Xpert,were currently moving into the anti gambling phase of the cycle that sees moral attitudes to gambling flip flop. winners are simply seen as collateral damage in the same way that bookmaker employees are. if they have to suffer its the lesser of two evils.,255
12Xpert,i get what you're trying to do. i just happen to think you'd get a better outcome for you and your potential customers if you helped them understand variance and luck. and if it turns out you really do have skill that works even better.,236
12Xpert,both wrong way too short. she doesnt yet have the game to compete. that will come with time and i have no doubt shes the next tennis super star given what shes already achieved. if i could id be laying 8 /1  all day long.,221
12Xpert,something doesn't have to be perfectly optimal for it to be preferentially selected via evolutionary trial  error. the point is that if some trait exists it is likely that it was selected preferentially as being more adaptive than some other similar but slightly different trait.,279
12Xpert,whilst in general pr has a lot to support it this is a fabulous counter argument that had never occurred to me. perhaps the solution then is to do away with parties and have no whips and free votes. how practical would that be however?,235
12Xpert,you are making the distinction between the activity and the marketing but many don't and attack gambling as morally repugnant per se. i also happen to believe that gambling if taught properly is an excellent vehicle to educate people to make better judgements under uncertainty.,278
12Xpert,"it took years for new zealand/australia to recover after being shafted by the uk joining the eu.

some say those rules should not be more important because they are not sufficiently democratic. for example most eu countries don't let citizens decide if updates are acceptable.",276
12Xpert,of course some people like jeremy corbyn aren't particularly keen on free trade anyway since it allows global multinationals to exploit uk workers and tax payers. i also seem to remember gordon brown arguing for british jobs for british workers. much easier if you're out.,272
12Xpert,"whether they were voting for a good idea is a different argument but that is not the one that remainers typically use when talking about the need for a second referendum. it's the ""you didn't know what brexit you were voting for"" that is used.",243
12Xpert,"if the uk leaves the eu then it will trade with south korea without tariffs. neither the uk not south korea will be in the eu. it appears that a country doesn't need to be in the eu to trade freely.

who need democracy more?",224
12Xpert,i'll remind you of that next time  starts a hand ball debate on match of the day. of course no doubt you will argue that this is not subjectivity this is just people not understanding how to interpret the rules which of course is subjective.,241
12Xpert,these things are easily solvable. if you tip have yourself verified independently. if you won't customers should always look elsewhere. i've been writing about this stuff for 1 0  years and more. still there are punters desperate to win easy that's why unverified tipsters exist.,279
12Xpert,gambling has a long history and not just in this country. dates back thousands of years to the romans and greeks (and earlier) with the use of astragalus of knuckle bones. the bible makes reference to the drawing of lots for the purpose of divination.,251
12Xpert,i would suggest that a problem behaviour would mean any behaviour that one felt compelled to engage in to relieve a craving but which ultimately fails to relieve the craving thus requiring further repetition of that behaviour and is harmful to one's general well being.,269
12Xpert,i hope health and safety will be considered when assessing whether to go ahead with todays planned route for silver group. already close to 1 0 0 m rain has fallen in past 2 4  hours and more rain and gales is expected for saturday.,232
12Xpert,the argument here is not that individual lines are wrong at closing - we know that already. the argument is whether nish's systematic identification of lines that are wrong at closing is lucky or causally connected to something. if the latter what is the something?,265
12Xpert,so what's the point? they shelved their affiliate programme or at least they pretended to. i suppose now i can expect them to start a new one on the back of this. would they invite back past affiliates and reactivate old accounts. would they ****,246
12Xpert,what benefit is having them listed on resolver?  are listed i submitted my case 3 rd april they aren't the slightest bit interested in replying. 8  days until escalation with ibas which will get absolutely nowhere because no one gives a **** about the customer/affiliate,270
12Xpert,if they were making 4  %  then fading would be possible in which case everyone would start doing it and then it would't be possible. humans are biased but they are not that stupid. players performances look exactly like a bell-shaped curve for a reason.,253
12Xpert,it's easier and more profitable for them to do it this way. a bet is consensual and if one party doesn't want to take part they don't have to. but they should be forces to be explicit about the reasons why they don't want to.,225
12Xpert,if people didn't think they had an edge why would they bet unless they want to lose money? the elephant in the room is that bookmakers won't tell their customers up front that they don't accept winners and that sports betting is for recreation only.,249
12Xpert,nice. but remember that when recreationals are offering lines that diverge from pinnacles by more than the effective margin it will be pinnacle that is on the right side and eventually the recreationals will close your accounts unless you take steps to disguise your activity.,276
12Xpert,its been a shambles for some time. disappeared from major odds comparisons basically because they refused to communicate. managed to close my personal betting account even though id not actually placed any new bets in the two months after the initial removal of bonus offers.,275
12Xpert,... that my guess is wrong and they are not efficient but the two together make it look like they are. the bayes in me suggest the latter is much less likely. but i'm merely highlighting the problem with trying to pin these things down.,236
12Xpert,picking up from last week i've now had a look at relative performance of  v  closing odds as means of predicting actual rois. following my previous work hypothesis is: implied 5 3 8  odds / fair pinny odds = exp roi. here's how things look.,240
12Xpert,books written by millionaires telling people how readers can become millionaires if they do the things the writer did are mostly worthless because we don't get to read the stories of those who didn't become millionaires who might very well have done very similar things.,270
12Xpert,ok the effective margin at betfair exchange is close to 0  %  so yes the figure will be much closer to 5 0  % . the 7 0  %  was for pinny's 1  times 2  margin which is about 2  to 2 .5  % .,189
12Xpert,actually i can do it.  offer opening odds for free so just give me a bit of time to get round to this. i think you're right it could be a useful exercise but i'm still sure pinny is going to come out ahead here.,211
12Xpert,main take is don't follow systems that are only based on trawling large volumes of data applying arbitrary criteria until you find something that would have made a profit. people are easily fooled into thinking their criteria can't be arbitrary. profits don't justify the criteria,280
12Xpert,i've found only one way to find +ev with draws and that is via wocs. draws are basically random propositions and i've not met anyone who can genuinely explain to me a methodology that would reliably and consistently forecast draws better than the published odds.,262
12Xpert,retrospective pattern spotting is charting/technical analysis and i thought anyone who was serious about betting/investing knew that this is akin to alchemy. mai's selling stuff so when someone puts it to him that his stuff is luck the onus is on him to prove otherwise,269
12Xpert,thats the point. is there a cause for the difference or is just random? you would see this difference happening by chance 1 2  %  of the time which means we cant yet rule out randomness and hence cant cast the clv hypothesis aside yet.,235
12Xpert,"indeed they will have to. but you can't keep printing forever. people have to do/make things it provides a huge part of what gives us meaning.

""to decimate the stuff of human life in the name of saving human life is a questionable moral approach.""",248
12Xpert,social distancing and lockdowns are designed to reduce healthcare pressures but may prolong this pandemic by reducing the exponential growth rate and they offer no exit strategy. locking down and waiting 1 8  months for a vaccine is not a strategy its a socioeconomic suicide.,276
12Xpert,does it matter if there is not a crossover? in most professional sport players aren't allowed to bet anyway. provided there's a market for competitive playing there'll always be a secondary market for betting on the playing even if the two groups are separate no?,263
12Xpert,the only way in the end to do this is to count all the people with antibodies. uk channel 4  news were talking about a new test that takes minutes that does this and is being rolled out to pharmacists to allow staff testing initially.,234
12Xpert,the lesson is is that in low validity environments where opportunities for learning through feedback are limited because of a very loose link between cause and effect (i.e. where there is a lot of randomness operating) you should not use outcomes to measure your success.,271
12Xpert,i see  is still taking adverts from gambling firms you and your colleagues have previously called out for licence breaches and breaking advertising rules. unibet william hill even betway yeah i've seen their ads too. ah feck it maybe i'm just indulging in tu quoque.,266
12Xpert,didn't daniel bernoulli have something to say about expected value via the st. petersburg paradox? humans tend not to equate value with utility especially not when it comes to things like dying. it seems that majority find more expected utility in panicking than chilling out.,276
12Xpert,"no i'm not worried. we all go sometime.

and how do you know what the death rate is? we don't know how many people have caught it. we'll only get the final answer when we can count how many people have developed antibodies against it.",234
12Xpert,it shouldn't but it does. i find it totally incomprehensible that we are prepared to shut down the world over something that that will almost certainly kill far far fewer people than road traffic accidents homicides influenza drinking and a whole array of other things.,269
12Xpert,"you see you did it again. you mixed up tennis with being better at tennis than all the others you are competing against who are also trying to be better at tennis than all the others they are competing against.

if you can be bothered:",235
12Xpert,if my maths is correct (i know you've told me it's not very good) then 1  %  of 1 0  %  is 0 .1  %  who miss out. but 9 9  %  of 9 0  %  is 8 9 .1  %  who will fuck up.,168
12Xpert,"agree with almost all of it. timeframe is not relevant. could happen after 6  months. or it might never happen.

and luck is always the main factor. it's just that over the longer term if you have a true edge then you can control her.",234
12Xpert,youve had several blogs and histories. people will draw their own conclusions. you use proofing services who you say are frauds but still use them. people will draw their own conclusions. youve had a tips history closed for spamming. people will draw their own conclusions.,273
12Xpert,...telling them not to worry that im full of shit and far more of you can win in betting than i am saying is possible? and your only argument is that because i cant beat pinnacle it means i dont know what im talking about?,222
12Xpert,you're making up more irrelevant rule changes. since when did anyone say that i'm not allowed to use pinny as a reference to find value. everyone uses a reference point. some people use their own models i use pinny's you just talk such utter shit.,247
12Xpert,that's very true. but i'm getting rapped for always pointing that out and the accusation is i do it because i'm a loser. if that's true so be it it will still benefit those who might otherwise throw a lot of money away being unlucky.,233
12Xpert,if you haven't read any of my books perhaps you can answer if you have read any of my  articles. when  asked me to start writing for them one of the reasons not given was that the things i had written about betting weren't helpful.,231
12Xpert,you would presume that's what will happen. i would expect the later to be more likely than the former which would imply that french workers will come (why would they bother) rather the govt. would be forced to accept more from eastern european india etc.,254
12Xpert,useful thread on impacts of brexit on eu workforce. presumably this wont impact current workforce who can all apply for settled status. presumably also if low skilled sectors cant fill jobs with british citizens these rules will simply be changed to deal with economic reality.,277
12Xpert,the counter to this would be that you're just being fooled if you think that gambling offers anything other than financial rewards for winners and misery for losers. which i find to be the most repugnant form of paternalism usually rooted in class and iyi-ism.,260
12Xpert,no that's not the argument. i now have an image in my mind about what  and  are getting at but i have a headache now from thinking about it and am just not up to the task of trying to put this image into words.,210
12Xpert,"collectively the market might look irrational but individual actors are not. i think taleb talks a lot about this sort of stuff. e.g. ""if a cognitive 'bias' is helpful it is not a bias"" and ""people misinterpret 'rationality' in economic theory. it means just coherence.""",270
12Xpert,do any of these biases actually even imply the people are irrational.  i mean people might prefer to back over simply because they want to see something win (rather than something lose) but either way they still know it's about 5 0 -5 0 .,238
12Xpert,sorry i meant the reported bias based on reported over-under betshares but i'm sure the same will apply for a bias like lovett's. so long as the bookmaker's model appropriately weights how much it pays attention to each bettor it should reproduce similar odds evolution.,270
12Xpert,we must make a distinction between money and utility. in monetary terms you are acting irrationally buying food because the seller is making a profit. but you gain relatively more utility from eating and enjoying the food so from a utility perspective it becomes positive-sum.,276
12Xpert,nothing comes free mark. yes it's nice to play poker with friends and there's no house against you. but it's also nice have a night out with food and drinks and atmosphere etc and the casino has to cover the costs of making that available.,239
12Xpert,financially it's zero sum (as is eating chocolate going to the cinema or pretty much anything else for that matter) but detractors of gambling fail to understand the significance of the gains that it offers since they only understand that activity in terms of money.,266
12Xpert,"when you see a price that you believe offers value how do you know whos backed the other side? in betting markets your competition remains anonymous.
besides i quoted you figures for a popular poker room and they are basically the same as for sports.",250
12Xpert,but you still have to find mechanism to keep the 9 9  %  apart from interacting with each other. in an open market thats impossible so inevitably those 9 9  %  will start competing against each other and the same competitive dynamics will take effect.,251
12Xpert,decreasing overround would indeed have increased the percentage of winners. but this will have been offset by a narrowing variance in skill sets amongst the best. and this will increase the influence of luck. people who were once winners may no longer be winners anymore.,271
12Xpert,"i do for you because i know you'll either wilfully misunderstand or just not get it. 

vt i'm still waiting for you to show me evidence that the percentage of ""winners"" is considerably more than 1  % . without it we don't really move forward.",242
12Xpert,why are these even interesting. it's an example of standard power law distributions of numerous natural social and economic systems which vilfredo pareto figured out in 1 8 9 6  when looking at land owned by italians. it says nothing at all about gambling addiction.,266
12Xpert,yes. ive already said efficiency is really just conceptual and how meaningful it is depends on the scale its applied. at the all matches scale its meaningless as a model. its also always badly wrong at the single outcome scale but that is self evident.,252
12Xpert,yes they could make more profit taking the risk of shading the line but as i've said i think the market response is non-linear and presents a new and potentially more dangerous liability. that's why i think they generally keep any bias within their vig.,253
12Xpert,not sure that will tell us that much other than there is noise about an efficient (or inefficient) line. here's the standard deviation in game totals versus bookmaker line. just confirms inefficiency at the resolution of a single game which i suppose is obvious anyway.,269
12Xpert,you like to argue that the bookmaker has a profit motive for biasing the line. i like the argument. it makes intuitive sense. and i've shown the maths for why. it's just that it doesn't really look like they follow it not for nba anyway.,237
12Xpert,we'll just have to disagree. business is the same. it's all a competition. like evolution almost everything that's tried fails because rewards for trying are not linearly correlated with effort. and things that win only win for a while before they're overtaken by new winners.,276
12Xpert,"another good debate. to answer the original question do they shade beyond the vig i think the sportinsights article answered it: ""if sportsbooks shade their lines 3  %  or more they are starting to leave money on the table for sports investors with good information.""",267
12Xpert,the fact that so many of you football index traders have got involved in this conversation including those who say they are addicted to it just confirms in my mind that it is built on sentiment. things built on sentiment have a tendency to crash.,246
12Xpert,things   others have said: almost everyone a winner almost all assets increased in value. makes it look like the profits are funded by new capital from newer customers. i don't believe it's an intentional scam but if fear overtakes greed end result might be similar.,266
12Xpert,could also be that the matches be picks out also happen to be ones that pinny can make more profit on by deliberately holding prices to exploit squares. i.e. they can make more profit by intentionally keep price inefficient to increase profit margin. just speculation.,268
12Xpert,then the others will say easier said than done mate. you know nothing about addiction. perhaps so but there has to come a point when everyone has to take some personal responsibility for their behaviour rather than expecting governments and regulators to look after them.,271
12Xpert,with respect to affiliates the argument goes that winners have skin in the game (because there is a downside) but affiliates don't (there is no downside). i'm sure those affiliates who built 9 0  %  of their income from  would beg to differ about downside.,256
12Xpert,"it doesn't mean it's a bad thing either. very few people get addicted to gambling.
this 'gamble to watch' hasn't actually been tested. what if doing this didn't increase addiction and lowered average household costs by reducing tv subscriptions. would that be a good thing?",273
12Xpert,anything that involves dopamine (and serotonin and endorphins for that matter) can lead to addiction. but gambling doesn't seem to me to be worse than other things that can trigger dopamine tolerance. most of it's bad rap seems to be a culturally pervasive social stigma.,271
12Xpert,to repeat i'm not talking about negative account balances i'm taking about expected profits. it's qualified because i'm one of the few people who's been bothered to try to answer the question 'how many people win in sports betting' with more than just copied anecdotes.,269
12Xpert,"define ""successful"".

to me this implies they soon figure out they've been tossing coins earning bonuses when lucky suffering unsustainable stress when they don't and leave as soon as they're set for life. only the real psychos would carry on knowing others pay for downsides.",276
12Xpert,did you find this strategy by trawling data retrospectively selectively applying criteria until you found a profit or did you think of a hypothesis and test it over the next 1 5  years? if the latter you might have something; if the former bin it.,247
12Xpert,given that they made at least some attempt to identify a disproportionate incidence of addiction amongst hi-rollers (1 1  times allegedly) one has to assume that they are aware of the distinction. although why then go with the initial headline about losses rather than addiction?,279
12Xpert,it's one think to say the gambling industry is reliant on the pareto principle. almost all business is. it's quite another to suggest as labour mp carolyn harris has that the industry is reliant on people with gambling problems. the two don't necessarily correlate.,265
12Xpert,is this expected points or points?surely if the former then for xg=0  xpts must be 1 .0 0 . if the latter then i assume the deviation of actual points about xpts=1  (0  1  or 3 ) will skew the average above 1 .,210
12Xpert,cassini wrote this several years ago. unfair maybe but the historical and legal landscape of betting in the uk makes it clear why this is the status quo and why change is unlikely. furthermore if change came there would be consequences for the unskilled,253
12Xpert,in effect what you're suggesting is making them like sharp bookmakers and if you did that loads of stuff like bog and cashbacks and odds boosts and goalscorer/scorecast markets and probably all of racing would disappear. 9 5  %  of players wouldn't want that.,259
12Xpert,such bookmakers would never agree to not offering loss leading odds because this is the very basis of their business model: attract a large volume of squares by using those prices and get rid of the ones that exploit them regardless of the reason.,247
12Xpert,i'm just not sure about this. the only way we'll ever get this clvh debate resolved is to have all punters submit all their bets publicly before then event. obviously never going to happen so we can never rule out luck and survivorship bias.,241
12Xpert,in fact for many markets the betting odds are a superb indicator of true probability. obviously exchanges are better than bookmakers which have ulterior motives for offering biased lines. and obviously we are talking on average since the variance in individual outcomes is big.,277
12Xpert,more people need to learn how to be able to hold two conflicting points of view (that can be formed from the same data) in their mind at the same time without suffering the usual cognitive dissonance. it will breed greater tolerance of others.,243
12Xpert,neither position is credible. there are always unknown consequences of government policy and these will impact low and middle earners. those who do (like mason) are completely devoid of an understanding of uncertainty. our biggest problem is we don't know what we don't know.,275
12Xpert,"the earth isn't flat? jeez who knew.
the reason many people in our society are miserable sick and highly stressed is because of an unhealthy attachment to things they have no control over.
 steve maraboli
flat earthism religion gambling. they offer very similar things.",269
12Xpert,with this sample it won't be enough with pinny odds. i should imagine like with most things you'll be able to make a profit from soft books but only because one of them almost always has a better price designed to attract new customers.,236
12Xpert,"again that's obviously pretty meaningless because it's basically a truism.

we have to go looking for it somewhere in between but it's tricky because of these 2  problems: variance at 1  end truism at other.

(in)efficiency is an elusive creature a bit like will-o'-the-wisp.",275
12Xpert,it is interesting. the pleasure apparently comes from the anticipation and is greatest with 5 0 -5 0  uncertainties. but what precisely are we anticipating? the financial reward or something else? like being right about stuff. being right = ego defence = survivalist strategy.,276
12Xpert,'maybe' is indeed addictive and there are evolutionary reasons for why. so rather then just hurl moral prohibition at gambling (which will fail) let's try to encourage players to understand whats going on. just possibly it might help lower the incidence of gambling pathology.,276
12Xpert,'maybe' is indeed addictive and there are evolutionary reasons for why. so rather then just hurl moral prohibition at gambling (which will fail) let's try to encourage players to understand whats going on. just possibly it might help lower the incidence of gambling pathology.,276
12Xpert,dopamine  serotonin. people get comfort in feeling in control (e.g. by predicting the future) even if that is all illusory which for almost everyone in betting/poker/financial day trading it is. similar to placebo. even when people told it's placebo they still take the pills.,276
12Xpert,i think his point is the pleasure gained from the anticipation of an uncertain outcome and the way people feel how they can control it. to piss on this in the way that you both do ignores some fundamental behavioural dispositions of homo sapiens.,246
12Xpert,in which case youre saying its not possible to make a living from betting. you may say as youve argued with  that you can by following tipsters. but you still have the same value problem. how do you know all your tipsters are skilled?,234
12Xpert,yes i'd say the same about every human behaviour. you can't take an outcome and infer that the person made it happen. that is turning causality on its head. instead you should study what the person is doing and see what the consequences are.,241
12Xpert,i took the trouble to put the premium page into the wayback archive. of the 1 4  pros active in feb 2 0 1 5  6  are still active today. all but one have regressed. the other 8 ? who knows where they went.,204
12Xpert,so betting is mostly a game of luck with the opportunity for some skill. but the more players with any skill compete with each other the more those skills begin to cancel out and luck will dominate even more. thats the paradox of skill.,236
12Xpert,5 6  %  would have you around the level of the worlds best nearly all of whom would not be selling their advice. so if you can find numerous tipsters at this level then theyre either cheating or their samples are simply too small.,230
12Xpert,one of the better ready-made wager tracking sheets out there. grab the standard version rather than basic to track clv in both points and line moves. i also add an additional sheet to calculate p-values for betting records segmented by sport and bet type:,255
12Xpert,the other issue some have with nish is his lack of clv. personally i'm ok with that as my views on clv tend to differ from the likes of  . i think joseph is slowly begrudgingly moving in my direction on that one .,213
12Xpert,"that was always armstrong's defence: ""i've never failed a doping test."" it just doesn't cut it anymore. we know that about 0 .5  to 1  %  of sports people fail tests but a third to a half have anonymously admitted to cheating when questioned.",242
12Xpert,no. it's further confirmation that pinnacle is more efficient than bet3 6 5 . it's also confirmation that bet3 6 5  prices are more likely to shorten when they've priced them too long. i suppose that's obvious but i wanted to see the data.,239
12Xpert,"in this sense sharp means ""knows how to exploit things like bog and woc"" which isn't actually very smart but smart enough to get you restricted. in the more specific sense i.e. sharp at a sharp bookie there's hardly any (imo 1  % ).",232
12Xpert,that's a rather arrogant and patronising position to take isn't it adam? if i understand you correctly you are suggesting that you understand cause and effect whilst other ignorant lesser people than yourself either don't or cant be bothered. or have i misread you?,265
12Xpert,from whom do bookmakers collected their change? and exchanges? i wouldn't exist if they didn't exist. presumably that make's them even lower than the lowest of the low. you should think a little more clearly about your position on gambling before firing off insults.,266
12Xpert,i suppose in the end those who don't want to leave will always present arguments for why it should be prevented: illegal. undemocratic. you're stupid. non binding. didn't know what we were voting for. it's a shame people can't accept others' points of view.,257
12Xpert,yes you will say dont blame the eu blame the nations for not doing that. but were talking about the same elitist politicians here who are all pro eu and dont believe the electorate should be considered because they arent sophisticated enough to understand.,256
12Xpert,"economists are notoriously bad at estimating error bounds. they are just human beings so it's hardly surprising and not their fault. but then lets not raise them up to the status of ""expert"". it's pretty much like me saying i'm an expert at roulette.",250
12Xpert,"goals scored in 2 0 1 9 :

sadio mane - 1 8
mohammad salah - 1 2

 despite this mane is 2 5 /1  to be the premier league top scorer this season while salah is just 5 /1

are bookies overlooking mane?",199
12Xpert,my 5 0 0  word reflection on:  entitled 'to win gambling in the uk you need to cheat'. please read it to get an insight into what i'm really trying to say. you decide if you think it's cheating  who is cheating. s appreciated.,226
12Xpert,have a look on the fixtures webpage. usually its friday afternoon for weekend fixtures(extra leagues friday morning) and tuesday morning for midweek fixtures. occasionally like this week it might change because im on holiday or something like that so post them when i can,271
12Xpert,rubbish. it's a way of publicly massaging your ego to give the impression you know how to pick winners without ever bothering to explain to followers that betting is not about picking winners it's about finding value. it preys on the stupidity of punters.,255
12Xpert,when asking why we do things i think you always have to start by taking the evolutionary perspective: why does a behaviour exist? most likely it's a winning strategy otherwise it would have already died out. what about it made it a winning strategy?,249
12Xpert,no. im a capitalist and social democrat. thats bottom up built from the risk taking and moralising of individuals to build societies that is greater than the sum of the parts. marxism is top down from the few not the many. it doesnt work.,238
12Xpert,it actually exploded with the internet 2 0  years ago. certainly it's a fair point to say that mobile technology and in-play advertising has mushroomed in the last few years with the potential for more harm but that is why regulation is addressing that.,253
12Xpert,the comparison with soldiers fighting in wars is totally absurd. i'm not expecting anyone else to put skin in the game for my benefit so as to avoid taking risks myself. it's up to tipsters if they want to take risks with sharp books.,234
12Xpert,"the rule is clear the interpretation will not be unless ifab has provided a detailed list of specific handball situation with hands and arms in specific positions and provided measurements to describe what ""unnatural"" means. merely saying it will be obvious proves the point.",275
12Xpert,i think the point is that humans think and process data very differently to computers. that's why chess grand masters capable of processing 3  moves per second can still often beat computers capable of 1 0 0  million. computers don't do chunking pattern recognition.,266
12Xpert,so i heard. so they should have restarted the game if thiem was there and djokovic losing by default. but thiem is probably too decent a fellow to agree to that and roland garros too spineless to take on the world number 1 .,224
12Xpert,why should anyone imagine it will really care about cleaning up the affiliate industry when  and  allow ads like this when the cap code states marketing communications must not link gambling to seduction sexual success or enhanced attractiveness (rule 1 6 .3 .8 ).,264
12Xpert,and  are just morally reprehensible full stop because they claimed their affiliate business was a brand liability so shut it ruining the businesses of many but in reality continued to work via third party relationships with the very people who brought it into disrepute,269
12Xpert,what i find morally reprehensible is some of these bookmakers using sharpness/smartness as an advertising strategy on mainstream television when it the case that if you prove to be sharp/smart you will be restricted or banned. the  should ban this but that wont happen.,269
12Xpert,would say the figure is infinity because you're not a proper fan if you bet against your team. if that hypothesis is true then infinity has to be the answer because you would be happy to lose everything to see liverpool win the league.,235
12Xpert,it's going to be difficult to find it with the method you've outlined i.e. comparing to outcomes. i could try z = 0 .0 5  0 .1  0 .2 5  and 0 .5  and i imagine i won't see much difference in the data.,200
12Xpert,(1 /2 ) it's an interesting idea but i my gut says it would fail. betfair exchange will basically be as efficient as pinny on average. however at the individual bet level both will contain errors and those will be random where they occur.,238
12Xpert,"i've probably confused the issue by using ""blind"" instead of ""blanket"" i.e. bet all available odds (level stakes). yes if you bet everything to level stakes you are likely going to lose unless your longer prices get lucky. or are you asking something different?",261
12Xpert,i suppose it does seem quite high but this is what was implied by the amount of odds movement that is typically seen. this was for a 1  times 2  soccer market. you might get a different figure for 2 -way spreads or over/under.,226
12Xpert,"as soon as any ""model"" proactively ""tells people what to do"" it becomes irrelevant.  if any ""model"" was a ""winning system"" then markets would cease to exist. a real model goes philosophy transposed into math and then subjectively/artistically applied.  anything else is snake oil",279
12Xpert,i imagine a lot of ratings systems manage that over large match sample. the problem is that they have greater accuracy variance over smaller samples of matches compared to implied probabilities based on bookmaker odds which is why they fail to make a profit.,258
12Xpert,i would guess so too. the odds are closing so yes you could argue that 5 3 8 's implied odds will lack a lot of new info but then that rather makes the case for what is the point of the ratings then.,199
12Xpert,i've no idea when the ratings are released but given they have them for games a long way in advance presumably before pinny release their odds. source for 5 3 8  ratings already shown in this thread source for closing pinny odds is oddsportal.,243
12Xpert,"good effort. i think it implies it sucks relative to pinny. isn't this further support for wisdom of crowd? ok so we might be simply talking ""crowd of pinny traders plus some sharp customers"" but it's still considerably bigger than 5 3 8 .",239
12Xpert,"my wocs document gives you three possible ways to do it that take into account the favourite longshot bias. 
from memory log method works best for 1  times 2  football market but this was only via a visual inspection i did no formal testing",240
12Xpert,marco blume head of trading has said some things that point to a general business model but they don't reveal specifics like how many of their customers beat the closing line by more than the margin and how well that correlates with actual rois.,245
12Xpert,yes i see now i was confused. but i wouldnt argue i was right if i won so im not allowing him the opportunity to do the same. this is not the way to prove you have a betting system that is worth selling.,203
12Xpert,presumably it will have escaped the attention of moral extremists that the biggest gambling market of all (the stock market) which i'm guessing they probably also disapprove of is the place where biotech companies researching vaccines for covid will be able to raise capital.,275
12Xpert,i know 1  who self isolated with symptoms for 2  weeks. he'd been skiing with a friend who had the same symptoms and was tested positive. i know of two others via my children's schools who have tested positive. several others isolating with symptoms.,250
12Xpert,but is it? the world didn't end in 1 9 1 8 . not did it end in 1 6 6 6  and 1 3 5 1 . it recovered and went to new heights each time. some might say this makes it antifragile.,175
12Xpert,"can we stop with the ""flatten the curve"" charts?

the equation is ""benefits of action"" minus ""cost of action.""

if you don't include the cost of global lockdown you're like a chess player thinking only of the most immediate consequence of their next move.",255
12Xpert,but he could tell another story that the  earns revenue from gambling companies that they claim exploit problem gamblers. he certainly has control over that and then if they refused to publish it he and we would all know where we stand with them.,246
12Xpert,to be honest i don't know. we don't know that an over-reaction won't lead to a far worse outcome. there are hidden variables to the original problem; there are also hidden variables to the reaction to the problem. it's a cascade of unknown unknowns.,249
12Xpert,"this is such a pointless conversation because you've already conceded that only 1  %  or less of bettors will be +ev.

you confusing being good at tennis with being good at being better than others at tennis. winning in markets applies to the latter.",250
12Xpert,yes its all this. thanks. its not about being pessimistic its about being sceptical. any good scientist is a bayesian sceptic. i guess that was my starting point by training. science has given the world better outcomes than alchemy precisely because of this methodology.,270
12Xpert,they are followable just like on blogabet. again you're just changing the definition to suit you. and yet you still haven't given me data from what you would consider to be hundred or thousands of tipsters as you would define them. why is that?,244
12Xpert,what am i supposed to do when you change the rules on what a tipster means. in the end we will be left with tipsters who we can't see and then there is no data to analyse. at which point we start doing alchemy.,210
12Xpert,"yeah i thought you'd say that. something's going on here i just can't figure it out. i'm not yet convinced that as you suggest it's all just a quirk of the numbers.

why is it that those winners see average shortening rather than lengthening?",242
12Xpert,but i don't like people dismissing others because they don't agree with their views. it's just another version of racism but along social class and educational divisions. it's not constructive as brexit highlighted. i'm sorry if i didn't articulate this properly via my sarcasm.,278
12Xpert,"please gareth you aren't intelligent enough to make your own decisions in life. you and i need truth talking mavericks to tell us what to think how how to behave. 

(and they wonder why things like brexit and trump happen. slaps face in desperation.)",250
12Xpert,that's exactly what they want to do. gambling is seen by the iyi-twitterati as morally evil and problem gamblers provide a convenient vehicle to express those views. actually these people don't give a f about addiction just like to indulge in paternalistic virtue signalling.,275
12Xpert,but at least your conscience would be clear. and furthermore because 9 0  to 9 9  %  of volume will have disappeared the problem gamblers won't be able to get as big limits as they can now so will have their gambling amounts restricted.,236
12Xpert,my guess is the draw is used to handle vig evolution between open and close more than home and away. certainly if you look at other bookies it's the draw price that has become superior over the years as the vig has gotten smaller.,230
12Xpert,ah yes but buying food is a positive-sum game. that's the point of trade. but typically people frame gambling in purely financial terms (certainly detractors do which is a point i made earlier in this thread). in purely a financial this game is zero-sum.,254
12Xpert,and along this journey i also take the trouble to (hopefully) show that even if you can't be a winner that there is plenty to learn from the process of making probabilistic judgements under uncertainty which will be valuable lessons for life more generally.,257
12Xpert,but there is an underlying reality that people even pro statisticians are not designed to think probabilistically. people prefer numbers and counts of things and binary propositions (trump is brilliant at it for example) rather than fuzzy logic. it's a big hurdle to overcome.,276
12Xpert,read the rest of it. my proposition is that arguably we havent valued the costs of economic growth properly. if we had paid for ecological degradation in a manner that was commensurate with its potential impact our financial market indices might look considerably different.,274
12Xpert,i suppose too the argument would be that a big louis vuitton has something to show for their spending in a way thats not the case with gambling. how utterly patronising to assume that the pleasure of anticipating uncertain outcomes is not a thing.,247
12Xpert,"hi agree that thiem has some raw talent and has the chance to be right up there with the best but he'll have to cut out the errors. he's massively improved on hard courts though.

what do you see in zverev that i don't?",219
12Xpert,sunday will be a walk in the (melbourne) park whoever  plays.  and  are engaged in a baseline slugfest. novak would eat that up all day. thiem makes too many mistakes and zverev just isnt talented enough. no changing of the guard just yet at,241
12Xpert,as with any system there will be uncertainty about the value of a bet. but if your system or model works then over large sample of bets that variance will cancel out leaving your signal. i'm not sure how you would reduce the variance.,234
12Xpert,the rate of gambling addiction in the uk is not statistically different to any other developed nation but in recent years there has been a section of society waging a moral crusade against an industry which has not done the best to help itself.,244
12Xpert,not sure i understand your position. whale does not necessarily imply problem gambler and no one has yet been able to refer me to peer reviewed research that it does. you and others might believe it to be true but science is not belief.,236
12Xpert,that may be so but if they try to exploit too much the sharps will wade in and the squares will follow that money. the system response will not be linear (imo) so they have to be careful how to position the public number.,221
12Xpert,but if you don't want to listen to me anymore (frankly i don't want to talk about it anymore) then you can either mute this thread (and all the others) or you can just not bother replying because i have nothing else to say.,223
12Xpert,well it is. but the reason you get limited is because they know you're taking prices they use for advertising purposes. i would presume you operate like pinnacle so don't do that sort of thing hence you won't be offering the intentionally inefficient prices.,258
12Xpert,yes and the last 2 4  hours of conversation on this have covered it in detail. in summary it appears to me to be largely build on positive sentiment (psychology) with new investor money supporting the player valuations rather than more fundamental intrinsic valuations.,269
12Xpert,yes i would agree. it was a word i'd seen mentioned elsewhere. for it to be a ponzi it would have to be fraudulent. it evidently isn't that. but it certainly looks like a 'castle in the air' and for me that's a non-starter.,223
12Xpert,but you don't know they rated you sharp by default. they might have rated you sharp because they know you are sharp. you'd have to know how they treat other customers how much volume is traded in total and so on to be sure.,223
12Xpert,"read my second book 

in all seriousness you should find out whether the tipster moves odds with their information. that's obviously in addition to the usual statistical tests on the results themselves but those only tell you the probability they can happen by chance.",268
12Xpert,very small. hence nish argues against clvh on the back of his results. but data from  on 2 7  pro tipsters would suggest its too early to dismiss it and that we need to look for other explanations why nishs record does not conform.,231
12Xpert,ads funded by losers sorry i mean problem gamblers according to errmm... oh i've forgotten... there was a newspaper running a story about it last week.... hmmm. something about a secret report saying big stakers were 1 1  time more likely to be addicts.,253
12Xpert,good points on children  advertising. but how is bet3 6 5  different to standard chartered? both are involved in the business of risk and uncertainty just different domains. the reason one is considered reprehensible whilst the other acceptable is because of social prejudice no?,279
12Xpert,yes absolutely indeed i'd argue that those who remain anonymous are significantly more likely to 'have it' than those who choose to put their head about the parapet. and as you point out that means we don't get to see them only pinnacle does.,242
12Xpert,it's been deleted. before ranting about people calling him out he should consider that his newspaper happily accepts ads from the very industry they are always complaining about ads that will disproportionately appear on the screens of gambling addicts they claim to care about.,278
12Xpert,"column a = actual level stakes profits and losses.
column b = expected level stakes profits and losses based on nish's calculated true closing odds (i think he used my margin proportional to odds method).
=test(a:ab:b2 3 ) (so two tailed two-sample unequal variance)",266
12Xpert,so not statistically significant. this is what i've been asking for re  apparent departure in this respect. so over a collection of tipsters the actual roi does not disprove the clv hypothesis at least in this data set. how many tipsters are included here?,256
12Xpert,what would be incorrect? that's it's unrepresentative? yes  i would concede it might be but i would challenge anyone to argue that bookmaker revenue does not conform to a power law distribution and a linear or normal one instead. this is basic economics.,254
12Xpert,no you're not nuts. the closing odds are there when the results become available. but macclesfield town are in financial difficulty with players going unpaid. this has meant that the club has had to postpone two fixtures and the league has docked points.,254
12Xpert,ladbrokes the same but managed 3 3  bets. advantage (minus margin) over closing was 8 .0  %  and over closing market average 1 3 .3  % . i actually had a yield of -1 3 .4  %  but they still shut my account.,206
12Xpert,here's the annual breakdown. obviously i have slightly different data to nish for 2 0 1 9 . i took out walkovers and retirements with 0 -0  sets scores as per pinny rules. maybe a few odds errors in the data set too.,216
12Xpert,"and nish i think your answer to your question is to be found in the article:
""it doesnt matter if we win or not [w]e beat the line in every single bet today. and when you beat the line... thats better than sex.",210
12Xpert,digging this up from 6  month ago. fractionally kelly does reduce your expected (mean) bank growth significantly but not your median. since kelly possible worlds are log-normally distributed you won't see the mean very often the median is a better indicator of expectation.,273
12Xpert,yes. it's balanced. just as it always is in a free country. if you happen not to like the economic/political/moral positions of that press that is not a reason to say it's not balanced it simply implies you don't agree with their position.,239
12Xpert,in as much as the conservatives said there will be no tax rises (obviously absurd) whilst corbyn said only the business and the top 5  %  will have to pay for the trillions that will be spent (obviously something from the twilight zone).,237
12Xpert,i should add that i will not be voting for my local conservative candidate but i deplore the abuse that many tory supporters receive from non-tories who they claim to be uncaring nasty four letter words. it's ad hominem of the worst kind.,238
12Xpert,i suppose the worst one is overconfidence. bets can't happen without it unless everyone is irrational and wants to lose. almost always 1  side will be wrong (and sometimes both when an exchange commission is involved). yet both sides think they are right.,255
12Xpert,no. i bettor can move prices without being profitable. efficient market hypothesis implies information moves prices. a bettor may hold new information but if its not important enough to move a price by more than the margin the bettor will not be profitable.,257
12Xpert,we can certainly debate whether she can't help being a hate-filled human being but until we do so i don't think it's right just to judge her as she is being judged in the same way she judges immigrants or muslims for example.,225
12Xpert,"so from this sample here's some figures for this. first:

bet on cold when cold is -0 .5  and hot is +0 .5

bets= 4 6 1 5
yield = 2 .0 2  % 
avg odds = 4 .2 8
p-value0 .2 3",172
12Xpert,has been debunking p-values for years. i believe he advocates at the very weakest level a threshold of 0 .0 0 1 . even then if you have a 1 0 0 0  monkeys gambling with your wealth.... you know how this goes,207
12Xpert,here you go then. a 4 9  %  bettor is basically a pinny coin tosser at odds of 2 .0 0 . a 5 2  %  bettor has an ev of +4  % . drawn like this doesn't look like a big difference.,177
12Xpert,from memory when i tested my woc model on the extra leagues data (which includes brazil and argentina) it was profitable but a little short on expectation implying pinny's odds for those leagues are not quite as efficient as for the main leagues.,246
12Xpert,seems about right. you'd typically expect about three 1 2 s or more in 6 9 2  3 6  %  bets but none is the most common. here's the probability distribution based on a 1 0 0 0 0 -run monte carlo simulation.,205
12Xpert,it's not really going to work with true kelly that's one of it's drawbacks. i'd use the initial balance for all simultaneous bets. that strictly makes it a mix of percentage and non-percentage staking and potentially riskier. therefore use a fractional kelly stake.,265
12Xpert,should have my article on the mathematics of losing runs published sometime this week. you can try the numbers and see if you agree with me. but really i'm just splitting hairs here. the points made by peter are well worthy of consideration.,241
12Xpert,it's similar for all the other minimum number of wins. so imo it doesn't make a blind bit of difference whether bet expected rois/win  % s are varying because of real life. the law of large numbers gets to work here very quickly.,229
12Xpert,if you're talking about handicaps then the reason you see 1 2  wins from 3 4  about once or twice a year is because that's about how often binomial tells you you'd expect to see that or worse not once in 6  years.,213
12Xpert,no because betfair exchange is equally efficient. some odds would be longer by more than the pinnacle margin and some not but if i bet only those which were longer then it's almost inevitable that this would contain a bias and undo me.,235
12Xpert,"i can't make these bets i've been banned by most of the bookmakers that offer the odds. but others with more patience than me make find ""ways"" of prolonging the life of their soft bookmaker accounts hence that's why i share this methodology.",241
12Xpert,so lets go back to the beginning. the links between cause and effect in betting are very weak just as they are in poker. that means most not all but most of what happens luck. betting like poker is a low validity environment.,225
12Xpert,it's an entirely plausible hypothesis that more minority sports offer more opportunity for greater success. but that doesn't imply that there is. you might see a greater proportion of higher yields. that could simply be greater variance in a smaller population of players.,272
12Xpert,there is less interest less information more variance more risk so bookmakers reduce limits. presumably casinos employ lower limits on 1  to 3 6  roulette game compared to black-red. what's your point? i'm still waiting for the data that show performances aren't quasi-random.,276
12Xpert,was looking for a referee bias. hypothesis: a referee is disproportionately more likely to balance up yellow cards in a match so home - away = 0  would be disproportionately more common than expected. referees would appear to be unbiased on this measure.,254
12Xpert,compared to expectation (using log function to estimate 'true' odds) 0 .0 6 2  (using a 1 0 0 0 0  run monte carlo. so not too far away from an academic publish a paper about the signal in blanket away win betting.,214
12Xpert,a lot of noise but the bigger the bet3 6 5  price value relative to pinnacle (pre-closing odds collected for football-data) the more bet3 6 5  shortens thereafter by closing. sample of 4 8 7 5  odds from this season's european league football.,243
12Xpert,a financial market rewards investors for putting money into companies. a sports market punishes investors for playing because the bookmakers take a commission. if you're too lazy do these these yourself this is a no brainer. financial market over sports market any day.,269
12Xpert,"likewise for the brexit debate and word like ""remoaner"" ""racist"" ""fascist"". the climate system is not some mathematical truism. it's a complex system whose response to a multitude of forcing factors humans being one of them is similarly complex and difficult to model.",268
12Xpert,i wouldn't doubt your sincerity although no doubt others who like to paint in black and white would do so. that is precisely how most affiliate tipsters probably operate. that's not to say that a few aren't knowingly advising bigger negative expectation bets.,259
12Xpert,for the majority of that as a peace project (great idea) and an trading agreement (great idea). since the single currency it's become more strained. single currencies can only properly work imo with single fiscal policies and that means having one nation effectively.,267
12Xpert,i think my take home conclusion is that unless a forecaster publishes their error margins or insists the journalist publishes them when reproducing the story their forecasts should be ignored and the forecaster to be assumed to be either clueless or a charlatan.,262
12Xpert,and once we've done that we can have a debate about how best to manage it. i tend to think that denial and prohibition carried by flimsy moral arguments is usually not very effective. again war on drugs is a case in point.,222
12Xpert,easy to be fooled by small samples but a priori i would say your reasoning is pretty reasonable. efficient books will be more efficient for bigger leagues. softer books arguably will be more tempted to offer more tempting inefficient prices for those leagues.,259
12Xpert,"list of column abbreviations here: 

basically you have 1  times 2  odds for 6  bookies over/under and asian for bet3 6 5  and pinnacle and max/average for all three market types. everything repeated for closing prices when i upload results and match stats.",257
12Xpert,however on matters of national and constitutional importance you have to ask the people. we did it over av and scottish independence.  every time there is a new eu treaty it should be put to the people of every eu nation. it isn't.,231
12Xpert,is there data in those graphs that supports this position i.e. old while male wealth correlates with privilege? is is not an example of conformation bias to assume that these people must be privileged? isn't it possible that some have worked very hard?,252
12Xpert,until i'm shown a large sample of bettors/tipsters that replicate what we see here i'm not going to change my bayesian prior about  efficiency. yours might be a special case for reasons that have been previously highlighted. samples of one don't prove rules.,258
12Xpert,"cite lack of evidence (that savvy customers are routinely restricted) as reason why they ruled in favour of  concerning a complaint about their ""don't bet silly bet savvy"" advert. the evidence will be there  easy to collect should  be required to release it.",258
12Xpert,is that what the  actually said in their ruling? the evidence will be there it would make an interesting research project into closing line value but perhaps what is in question whether they bothered to look for it or whether coral refused access.,247
12Xpert,as i've mentioned before i complained about the coral 'bet savvy' advert and the asa found for coral and against my complaint. in some ways not their fault as they probably don't have a clue how gambling companies operate but they should ask.,242
12Xpert,lads lads lads  everybody. gvc calls for end to tv gambling ads  football shirt sponsorship. as owners of  who have possibly the nastiest ads of all i can't decide if this is ironic machiavellian a late april fool or they actually do care.,239
12Xpert,one reason is that nish picks out bets that have a lot of square action on the other side which pinny can profit from by holding the line. they would be happy to let nish have his +ev without moving the lines much.,214
12Xpert,pinny better. when i first investigated woc i used the market average and it just isnt useful presumably because most of what makes up the average are recreational bookmakers posting intentionally inefficient prices. thats why i turned to pinny to do the job.,259
12Xpert,you have just 1 3 1  tips in your records. let's talk again when you get to 5 0 0  and then 1 0 0 0 . if you're still at 1 7  %  roi then from similar odds then it gets interesting.,181
12Xpert,i'm not saying it's impossible i'm saying it's very hard and harder than most people believe which is how this conversation started. most bettors are kidding themselves. overconfidence is how betting becomes rationale in the first place. otherwise no one would do it.,267
12Xpert,but if they failed to adjust it sufficiently they they would simply introduce account restrictions.. but that's not going to happen because their model is all about trying to understand what true prices are and managing risks around that too maximise their profit.,264
12Xpert,but suppose they were. what do you think would happen? who's going to fund their profits. if there is no more square money they can't all get paid. so less sharp pros end up funding sharper ones. betting is a relative skills contest.,233
12Xpert,"if you are a  looking for transparent verification i can only recommend submitting your picks through  

not only are your picks verified by actual bets placed by followers but you will also be able to configure multiple pricing options.

plus a lot more...",257
12Xpert,yes that's true but then you're effectively suggesting you shouldn't bet until the last possible moment and then the odds will be maximally efficient and hardest to beat. which further begs the question whats the point of pre-closing ratings if they aren't better?,264
12Xpert,"my wocs system cannot possibly work because squares are this dumb to force bookmakers to offer thousands of loss leading prices. recreational bookmakers do this to attract new customers by selling the ""we offer great prices"" message. then they ban for regular exploitation",272
12Xpert,as the loss of bury fc demonstrated a football club plays an essential community roll. to paraphrase shankly they are more important than life and death. if we destroy these thibfs then the whole approach to dealing with this catastrophe counts for nothing.,257
12Xpert,"hltv covers csgo it is the most organized and popular
there are match bets over unders # of kills and usually 3  maps so you can make bets between maps


joindota covers lol. it is not as organized and is still super popular",224
12Xpert,its not informative in the slightest. its garbage with no useful content at all. evidently you see something useful. no idea what that is. perhaps you can only see it if youre not european. might you australians obviously cant see anything useful either.,254
12Xpert,don't you think this is a classic human response to being afraid of something new unknown and potentially uncontrollable? all of those other things are largely uncontrollable but they are not new and not unknown hence people are familiar and not afraid anymore.,261
12Xpert,atp and wta tournaments cancelled. probable that others will follow. as in financial markets it appears the human race has completely lost its shit over  the infectiousness of fear puts the ability of a small piece of rna to spread completely to shame.,252
12Xpert,i think we should close this this and agree that we see things from slightly different perspectives but broadly agree on the main points which is betting is hard to be successful at and anyone who achieve it in whatever way deserves respect.,241
12Xpert,i know i know. i can only do my best. i don't have all the answers and some of them might be wrong but at least i make the effort to attempt prove my hypotheses with data analysis rather that opinions and beliefs.,213
12Xpert,what did tarquin do for the first 3 8  years of his life before he started cycling to work and eating vegan after he decided the planet is in danger? did he emit more carbon or less carbon than jose in the favela?,213
12Xpert,wow. 4 0  %  of nearly 1 0 0 0  people would chose the high odds tipsters. i fear my last 2 0  years educating bettors has been in vain. incredible how humans fear uncertainty (variance) and yet they simply don't understand it.,227
12Xpert,introducing a margin does change things so that the magnitude of the move is greater for the longer odds (which will tend to be losers). but really this is irrelevant. it's the fact that there is a difference at all that is relevant.,233
12Xpert,presumably youre referring to his critique of dawkins atheism. thats a different matter. ive actually quizzed him myself in person over his perception of the difference between science and faith and was shot down for my troubles. sadly i think he misunderstood me,263
12Xpert,you can instead use fractional version of kelly this reduces the variance but doesn't have too much impact on your expected median bankroll. for kelly staking median is arguably better than mean since the latter is skewed by some very big possible banks.,254
12Xpert,it could be but presumably neither buyer nor vendor believes that to be the case (over-confidence). and even if financially speaking it is worse if the illusion is that it's better arguably that is still a gain (emotionally speaking). a bit like placebo,253
12Xpert,the real problem is that anti-gamblers only see it as a financial transaction which is overtly zero-sum not realising that there are other positive gains to be had in terms of excitement at the anticipation of uncertain outcomes which is an evolutionary response.,263
12Xpert,doesn't imply the losers would lose about the same or that the bookmakers would make more. from the bookmaker's perspective they might use sharps to make it easier to exploit squares. from the loser's perspective they might get better limits and bet more.,255
12Xpert,i'm not removing for this. to which you will now say there is no true price movement at all it's just pinny switching where the vig sits between open and close because they are evil masters of the universe and can exploit everyone.,231
12Xpert,"i'll start it off. 
does pinnacle shade lines beyond the size of their margin in an attempt to increase profits by exploiting square customers? if yes is that systematic or just when the conditions of a match present themselves e.g mayweather v mcgregor?",254
12Xpert,of course this is complete nonsense. you and i both know we are not talking about the average price of something happening being 1 .0 0  and and outcomes showing that on average a thing happens 1 0 0  %  of the time.,216
12Xpert,i don't doubt that. efficiency is also a relative concept. opening pinnacle odds are pretty damn efficient but compared to closings odds they contain barely any relevant information. if opening and closing odds were two competing punters the latter would be smashing it.,270
12Xpert,....message they offer great prices to look good and attract new customers. their business models requires large numbers of customers in contrast to pinnacle which is large turnover. but if you exploit their generosity repeatedly they will limit you or close your account.,272
12Xpert,"feeling in control is an essential psychology for self aware creatures who like all creatures seek survival. i know this goes rather deeper than you'd like but there must be things that underpin ""wanting to win"" and arguably these are deep-rooted and subconscious.",264

12Xpert,"furthermore a freedom of information request reveals that the ""analysis"" comes in the form of a set of power point notes. there does not appear to be any peer-reviewed source meaning it is impossible to scrutinise the methodology or attempt to reproduce it.",257
12Xpert,i also happen to believe that paternalism isn't the way to solve people's vulnerability to certain behaviours. unbiased education and an insistence on personal responsibility is. if that makes me unemotional so be it. i prefer to solve problems not take ideological positions.,276
12Xpert,being close to 'true' line might mean most books leave them taking positions but over large samples the law of large numbers will rescue them. so long as they are close to 'true' line they will make a profit in the long run.,224
12Xpert,well initially i thought yes that would make no sense. biases must surely be in one direction. but  reminded me of what i wrote about price anchoring. so it would be possible to get two equal and opposite effects cancelling out. e.g. this...,241
12Xpert,well not necessarily but it does suggest they stay close to what they think is 'true'. and it does suggest that square money doesn't much influence market movement. coincidentally my next article for pinny (if they publish it) is looking at this idea.,251
12Xpert,speaking of market efficiency here's the expected v actual nba totals plot for data from 2 0 0 7  to 2 0 1 9  (lines from sportsbook reviews' data which is based on pinny 5 dimes betonline bookmaker heritage and westgate). bias anyone?,235
12Xpert,work doesn't have to be academic to be hard. shelf stacking is easy not because it's not academic but because it's not a relative-skills competition where only the best get paid. betting is. a betting exchange is a cut-throat relative skills winner-takes-all competition.,271
12Xpert,well on average for main league football i don't think they are. the closing price is a great predictor of actual returns. if the way i was removing their vig was considerably more wrong than the size of their vig that wouldn't work.,233
12Xpert,wtf? what has what is good for racing suddenly got to do with problem gambling? if you were a bookmaker that suddenly lost 9 9 .5  %  of your turnover how would you manage the stakes of the remaining 0 .5  % ?,209
12Xpert,but actually is it? efficiency only really has meaning over samples (so that errors cancel leaving the signal). the smaller the sample the greater the probability that the implied probabilities are wrong (inefficient). this reaches a limit for a sample of 1 .,259
12Xpert,if a traditional gambling market is a negative-sum game from the perspective of the bettor because of the house edge how is fi not also negative-sum given that it charges 2  %  commission for selling? they ain't doing this for free you know.,241
12Xpert,"quoted from their site.
""7 4  %  of people said they tend to lose money on traditional gambling.
2  %  said they tended to lose money with football index.""

even after account for ego and survivorhip bias that's one hell of a difference.",237
12Xpert,"""almost every player on the index has increased in value over the past two years due to more and more people investing in the market as a whole.""
that's is exactly how a ponzi operates even though this may not have been intentional.",232
12Xpert,if you honestly think it's much higher than 1  %  then how the hell do you think bookmakers could operate legally. it's just complete nonsense. granted there are pocket of corruption as you've pointed out but then why would you bet on those.,241
12Xpert,it tells me that the figure of 3 0  %  is meaningless since no customer is going to get 3 0  % . it also tells me that any customer is going to have to work damn hard to keep their accounts open.,195
12Xpert,indeed but that's not what you said. you said vig is more not amount. you could simply halve your stakes on both sides so that your overall volume is the same as it would have been. then the amount will be the same.,215
12Xpert,current figures are about 0 .5  %  from memory. if we say that that's about the same as the number of sharp bettors which is actually a bloody hard thing to be that would imply it's bloody hard to get addicted to gambling.,222
12Xpert,of course if proper scientists could do some proper science on this we might get some proper answers rather than leaving it to journalists with axes to grind and a gambling commission that probably isn't fit for purpose for all sports of reasons.,246
12Xpert,that's a historical artefact. additionally could you not imagine a world where gambling companies are the first choice of live football streaming. then premiership and fa and the players salaries could not survive without it. it might also prove cheaper for the customer.,271
12Xpert,for sure the vast majority of those players will have been lucky but their profits still distribute according to a power law. the few with the most profits are much more likely to have been skilled (or sufficiently more skilled than the rest).,243
12Xpert,8 0  %  of the profits go to 1 0  %  of the players; stronger than pareto. 5 0  %  go to just 2  %  of them. here's the cumulative distribution of profits to number of players. power law written all over it.,207
12Xpert,was this change made to make the piece more morally emotive? or was it made because the original title was so obviously stupid? or both? and it's been done without changing the content to attempt to correlate high staker with gambling addict.,242
12Xpert,"oliver langford has shown the most yellow cards in the  this season - 6 0  in 1 5  games an average of four per match. 
bar chart shows referees who have issued 2 1  or more yellows this season. 
stats courtesy of",213
12Xpert,"more faulty correlation. where's you evidence that it's ""more likely to be from people... who can't stop.""
i know perfectly well that most of the bookmaker's profits come from a small proportion of players but that doesn't imply these players are addicts.",255
12Xpert,until you show me a credible source that demonstrates addicts account for the majority of profits of the gambling sector then everything that the likes of the  and  and labour mps say on this topic can be assumed to be anecdotal moralising.,240
12Xpert,that's not evidence of unscrupulous behaviour on the part of bookmakers that's evidence of uncontrollable addiction and anecdotal stories of how it was facilitated. as has been said the law as it stands should stop unscrupulous behaviour on the part of bookies.,261
12Xpert,not sure goal posts are being moved. my original point was that  story wasn't really news at least from the point of hoping for any material impact to follow it was simply moral trumpet blowing. cassini's article explains why it wasn't news.,241
12Xpert,"that sounds like moral trumpet blowing to me then. ""how can be right that she earns this much when she refuses custom from people skilled enough to beat her?"" it's old news and needs to be sophisticated up to have any impact.",225
12Xpert,"flat earther's have ""observed"" the earth to be flat. you need to be more rigorous than that. simply saying i believe it to be so isn't good enough. have you first hand evidence of it for example from working within a bookmaker?",227
12Xpert,"because by ""winners"" and ""efficiency"" i am talking about markets set by the likes of pinnacle. the recreational bookmakers are far more inefficient but that is deliberate (not out of stupidity) with a view to attracting new customers and keeping existing ""mugs"".",262
12Xpert,perhaps the difference has arisen because of the different starting points of the bookmaking industries either side of the 'pond'. uk/europe has a more regulated and taxed regime hence market making high turnover low margin 'accept winners' is more expensive and difficult.,273
12Xpert,new daily sheets for ip football trading. using both my xg models and database it auto-populates and highlights the qualifiers for strategies selected. epl complete just 1 4  more leagues to add  should save me hours of prep in the long run,240
12Xpert,not necessarily. there's a strong argument for it but bookmakers have never really articulated this publicly as far as i'm aware. furthermore marco bloom of  has hinted that it's more nuanced for example traders might intentionally bias lines to make more profit.,263
12Xpert,"you've now idea how boring this conspiracy has become. it's pathetic. if you don't like something simply say there are ""dark forces"" working against you eh?. given you work in gambling i'm amazed how easily you can be be fooled by randomness.",242
12Xpert,"don't ask me ask them.

for what it's worth if you want better social care higher personal tax and national insurance allowances a properly funded nhs and free tv licences you either borrow more or you tax more or both. that's how.",231
12Xpert,survivorship bias is where we see the winners but the losers are hidden from views so we draw false conclusions about the validity of the process. how does this one single record imply anything about the presence or absence of survivorship bias?,245
12Xpert,klopp plays fabulous football his players adore him for it and that is why they do so well right now. it's also good for the fans. pro sport is not just about trophies it's also about entertainment. ferguson had this in spades.,227
12Xpert,"there is an average shortening of 2 -weeks per season of a premier league manager based on this analysis which i am sure is completely flawed but nonetheless highlights a trend we all know to be intuitively true. probably driven by ""money-in-football"".",252
12Xpert,it's just the principle of price discovery. of course humans are biased and facilitate inefficient prices but eventually those inefficiencies get understood and exploited away too. the market always evolves but the larger it becomes the harder it is to beat it.,261
12Xpert,here's a thought for saturday night: if i could educate every single punter to only bet a soft book price when it was best in market and never bet on anything else those bookies would be forced to change their model right?,222
12Xpert,some interesting debates in these threads about closing line value/efficiency. im not convinced by the argument that using large volumes of money to manipulate a market disproves the more general hypothesis. but it certainly illustrates that clv is a very nuanced concept.,272
12Xpert,"for sure i'm open to the idea that using excel's random number generator to estimate confidence limits is not the right approach but i need a convincing a priori reason not one based on ""i don't agree with what i am seeing.""",224
12Xpert,this record is with flat stakes yes. 1  unit. but it's up to you if you want to do something different. from memory full kelly staking would have seen 1 0 0  become 8 m (assuming you could get the stakes down).,210
12Xpert,an alternative perspective would be that westerners are less hung up on looking good reputation and saving face within social contexts all phenomena of confucian societies and are thus more likely to regard cheating to achieve those aims with more moral opprobrium.,265
12Xpert,scam ale: gotta hand it to this site for the brazen attempt to defraud people. looks like it's run by an english trio in eastbourne but the map is somewhere in mexico city and the phone number is fake and doesn't work.,218
12Xpert,that's certainly a valid view. however i think a more accurate view is that qataris just aren't interested  haven't bothered turning up which then very much makes this about money since what's point in holding it in a country that's not interested?,248
12Xpert,beyond intuition i guess it would be difficult to know. all you're left with is t and z tests. i suppose you could use bayesian stats somehow but it still using results to test skill and that often leads to false conclusions.,225
12Xpert,"on the basis of this data i wouldn't call it ""so inefficient"". it's still much more efficient than soft bookmakers. as for it's exploitation i would expect it to be smaller than their margin so not really possibly on a consistent basis.",236
12Xpert,"maybe people find those who say ""prorogue"" boring bastards. flat earthism on the other hand much more interesting. fits nicely with those other conspiracy theories that people like jc routinely encourage their acolytes to indulge in. ""you're being controlled by the f/jew.""",273
12Xpert,"longshots could be due to variance but it is a big sample so i do find it puzzling.

aren't the results a bit below expectation. if your cutoff threshold is 5  %  then your expected roi should be higher than that right?",219
12Xpert,my thoughts exactly.  will be interested. also why the long odds performing so poorly?something wrong with the model to estimate fair odds and the way it accounts for the favourite long shot bias perhaps?  seems too large to be just model error.,245
12Xpert,i think you're conflating different moral arguments. there is one about whether gambling is morally acceptable or not. then there is another about whether tipsters mislead customers by either knowingly or blindly confusing luck with skill. i was talking about the latter.,271
12Xpert,how do you know? why didn't you cry variance! instead of boom! when you were winning last season? why do bettors/tipsters always assume it's skill when they are winning and variance/bad luck when they are losing? it's just self serving attribution bias.,253
12Xpert,the same result would be met with exactly the same arguments: someone broke the electoral law; we didn't know some things; you are stupid. these are all attempts to prevent the uk leaving. it's so completely disingenuous to suggest it's anything else.,251
12Xpert,there are laws and there are morals. they dont necessarily correlate perfectly. advisory and non binding are frequently used as arguments to reject the referendum result. they would never have been used by the same people if the result had been different.,255
12Xpert,only ireland held a referendum on the terms of the lisbon treaty. the eu does not require any member country to hold a referendum to approve membership or as part of treaty ratification. that is unacceptable and undemocratic. it should be mandatory.,249
12Xpert,"ken clarke's position is that matters of the eu are too sophisticated to allow people a say it should be left to ""experts"". what do you think people who lost their job or life savings in the financial crash make of that?",220
12Xpert,"before anyone remarks we haven't left yet these foercasts were for the two years following a vote to leave and assumed a bilateral trade agreement with the eu would have been negotiated.

why on earth would anyone bother listening to an economist?",247
12Xpert,in april the forecasts were for germany to manage it sometime within 2 0 1 9 . if germany's economy contracts july to september then it's in one. specific enough for you or should i just be a wanker and block you?,213
12Xpert,that could be legislated against but you would undoubtedly see a change in the odds it sports at least which would impact the majority of customers. however i suppose the majority of customers either don't know or care too much about odds.,239
12Xpert,perhaps alex if you were taught about finance risk taking uncertainty chance and randomness when at school you and many others might end up making better financial decisions. this doesn't just apply to gambling but to people's relationship with money in general.,262
12Xpert,bet3 6 5  appear to have doubled their overround for premiership games. any idea what's going on? same for championship but oddly not for leagues 1  and 2  which are still at 1 0 2  %  to 1 0 3  % .,198
12Xpert,"you tell him richard. 
eating is a far bigger public health issue in the uk but i don't recall the church having too much to say on the matter.
when the church talks about gambling it always make it a moral issue.",213
12Xpert,evidently aimed at me. have the decency to tag me next time. you have much to offer but your personal criticism is unpleasant. you pretend to know a lot about me when in fact you haven't the slightest idea just making presumptions.,231
12Xpert,or they are for players who are willing to put in the work to disguise their softbook +ev. i just don't see what your problem is here. of course if you don't like it there is nothing forcing you to follow me.,208
12Xpert,if advertising effects are complex with the potential to create numerous confounding factors is it then really fair to conclude that consumers should be protected against the targeted content of gambling advertising if the research hasn't shown whether it has an impact.,270
12Xpert,"there are different interpretation of what ""problem"" actually means. there are higher figures quoted but which figure is quoted correlates significantly with the moral standpoint of the quotee (is that a thing?). as with almost everything today the debate is becoming polarised.",278
12Xpert,we are very bad at estimating variance. have a read of what daniel kahneman has to say about it in an interview (on confidences intervals). if i remember rightly we quoted a lot of this in his book thinking fast and slow.,221
12Xpert,that's assuming this new body carries any regulatory weight with the likes of  and  which it won't. and if it did the more likely outcome is that it would just kill off the affiliate industry because brands would simply do what  did.,233
12Xpert,not to mention the breaching of actual doping rules. .there will be those who say these are minor offences arising from innocent errors. once you know how easy it is to fool the system you'll realise these are intentionally systematic to cheat.,244
12Xpert,[2 /2 ] i've simply disagreed with your position and am left wondering if that is more because we're talking about slightly different things or whether there really is a difference of opinion. regardless it's good to have different opinions. aids learning.,256
12Xpert,and no. you can't win 4 5  %  through skill unless the skill under scrutiny is deliberately trying to lose but most people are rational and prefer not to do that so we don't need to consider that tail of the bell-curve.,219
12Xpert,perhaps if the industry spent more time being honest and open with its customers it would gain more respect and less of a reputation for screwing both problem gamblers and would-be sharps in different ways. and perhaps then less need for regulations.,250
12Xpert,casinos manage just fine. players know they can win only by being lucky but are still happy to play. why can't it be the same with sports if bookmakers refuse to allow skill (in the same way casinos publicly refuse card counters)?,230
12Xpert,will explain how exactly in the next article for  (hopefully published at the start of next month). i'm sure he'd be happy to run over it in brief again here and for a rough approximation use the regression equation in the chart.,229
12Xpert,not all of them will be but on average they are more efficient than bookmakers offering intentionally loss leading value. the errors will be randomly distributed and cancel out. that's the theory at least hand chris' results seem to back it up.,244
12Xpert,specifically i'm interested to know how your safer gambling campaign board came to the conclusion that the best way to tackle impulsive gambling when a bet is placed when drunk bored or chasing losses is via ridicule and mockery. perhaps  could comment.,253
12Xpert,yes you'r right. going to be effectively impossible to test. perhaps the easiest way would be for  to published closing market probabilities based on the same information available to the bookmakers and everyone else. still my hunch is that they will fail.,256
12Xpert,yes i agree with all of that. it will be nigh on impossible to make this a perfect study. however my general point still stands. if a bookmaker's closing prices make better predictions of outcomes what is the point of other predictions?,236
12Xpert,why am i going too far? you haven't set out a case. we agree that there are a small percentage of bettors who will show true +ev. i happen to think that figure at a book like pinny is probably 1  % ,198
12Xpert,i did spend considerable time making sure the team names were matching and that the two data sets were properly correlated. if there were any residual discrepancies then these will not have been included in the sample for example for awarded games.,248
12Xpert,i've scaled the blind betting stakes in the graph by a factor of 2 1 9 1 5 /(3 *1 8 1 0 5 ) so i can make a fair visual comparison. difference is not statistically significant but still.... oh dear.,198
12Xpert,he also explained why you shouldn't turn causality on its head and assume that if you have found a pattern from retrospectively dredging data that its existence proves it had a reason for happening. he called the people who do that fools.,238

12Xpert,yes unsurprisingly you misunderstood. i thought id been clear. being good at tennis is not the same thing as being better than others at tennis. they distribute completely differently. same as with predicting the future versus being better at it than others.,258
12Xpert,"oil shock is a knock on effect. projected drop in demand followed by saudi-russia price stand-off.

i sometime wonder how things would look if women were in charge of the world. i suspect the variance of behaviours and outcomes would be smaller.",245
12Xpert,well it will work only for a two player market. for more runners the maths will get more complex so easier to simply sum the reciprocal of the odds and then invert that answer manually to get the expected return or payout.,222
12Xpert,i suppose i'd start by insisting that a disclaimer is added that you can lose money betting and the more the tipster sells themselves as the best thing since sliced bread the bigger the text of that disclaimer would have to be.,227
12Xpert,but i've never said a tipster in isolation with a yield and a profit can only have achieved this from luck. i simply say that the vast majority will have done that because as a population that is what it looks like.,215
12Xpert,perhaps those who dont understand variance shouldnt be betting to win (just betting for fun). if youre using a tipster then presumably youre betting to win. ive tried to encourage people to understand variance so its frustrating getting criticism for doing that.,262
12Xpert,tipster money back guarantees are gimmicks at best and charlatan trickery at worst. clever manipulation of survivorship bias. tipster gets paid when hes lucky gets nothing when hes not. net gain for tipster. net loss for the idiot falling for this rubbish.,256
12Xpert,for sure in my 1 4  years of tips verification i came across so much bullshit like this you would not believe. most of it was just deluded tipsters fiddling with their records or closing and starting again very little deliberate cheating.,238
12Xpert,lets start with the reaction to covid-1 9 . the word appears to be happier to tank its global economy with all the devastating socio-economic impacts that would have on people than face a new virus whose risk is similar to flu.,227
12Xpert,ok quit with bullshit insults if mybigpartner is a verification service which it claims to be then you submit your picks to it with the bet odds stake and bookmaker. if thats not whats going on then someones not telling the truth.,230
12Xpert,but you still haven't shown me the sample. show me the sample of these skilled tipsters you talk about and i will have a look at them. we know sharp bettors exists. pinnacle imply they exist. that doesn't mean they will tip.,224
12Xpert,surely the point is that people more tolerant of others with different opinions are demonstrating a capacity to have a bigger in-group (with less antagonism towards out-groups) which is all the more ironic given remainers' desire to stay in a bigger group.,256
12Xpert,for anyone wondering the distribution of possible betting performance using percentage staking money management of which kelly is an example is log-normal. the mean is heavily positively skewed by some lucky massive bankrolls. median is a better measure of what to expect.,272
12Xpert,which is variance. if your thinking is correct and they understand variance then they are motivated by the chance to get lucky and greater utility in the bigger good luck/bad luck ratio for odds of 3  than for odds of 1 .5,222
12Xpert,"""the most intolerant wins."" 

seriously though not sure really. i'd assume both have got more efficient with more volume more models more metrics analysis more people aware of biases that cause inefficiency more everything. not sure how the relative difference has changed.",273
12Xpert,yes mark. the most intolerant wins. that's why things like brexit (which i should add i actually voted against) are such a brilliant thing because it give a change to the majority to tell the most virtue signalling paternalistic minority to fo.,244
12Xpert,so really the immorality (if you want to call it that) is in not being straight with punters about what they will be permitted to achieve in their terms and conditions when opening accounts. that could be legislated for i am sure.,230
12Xpert,basically these numbers tell you it's not chance that this result has happened. in other words you couldn't randomly divide the full set of opening to closing ratios into two samples and get this much different between the average ratios. completely impossible.,261
12Xpert,"right i get that and already mentioned anchoring as an example of a causal mechanism that could see opposing errors cancel across the data resolution we're looking at.
but these systematic deviations are extreme and imo fail the test of occam's razor.",251
12Xpert,while i happily blogged for 1 0  years about tipsters (because in 9 9  %  of cases there was no value there) i never shared the hundreds of little hacks/edges i had found myself. if i mentioned them they would end overnight.,224
12Xpert,whether something is considered zero- or non-zero sum surely depends on how we define utility and what matters to us doesn't it? so yes i guess most people would say the lottery is positive sum but there might be some who wouldn't.,231
12Xpert,"true score theory:
variance in outcome = variance in skill + variance in luck.

as donald luskin said i'd rather be lucky than smart.

in the end everything reduces to luck: environment education upbringing genes your birth existence.

determinism is simply illusory.",267
12Xpert,that's not possible legally in the uk unfortunately. and as i think  has pointed out recreational punters like recreational bets which means things like racing scorecast 1 st goalscorer etc. the types of hope offered at a recreational bookmaker are more fulfilling.,265
12Xpert,the amount of available money is the limiting factor and even if you take out the vig it's still no better than zero sum. you don't get paid for being good. you get paid for being better than others you're playing against.,222
12Xpert,in fact this little tool is a great way to catch out fake tipster records. break their history of bets into a number of equal-sized samples (with similar odds). calculate the variance and compare to what you'd expect according to statistical principles.,253
12Xpert,i've posted this already in another reply but thought it useful to add to this main thread. here's the efficiency for the opening lines. almost no difference. and this demonstrates the problem. using averages at this resolution doesn't reveal any hidden inefficiencies.,269
12Xpert,if anchoring is a real effect in a market it would explain why steamers don't steam enough by closing and drifters don't drift enough relative to 'true' prices/lines but when using average odds to measure efficiency these competing effects could be hidden.,256
12Xpert,unless they are biasing some lines one way and some the other way within a single point resolution but do you really believe that is what they do? emh seems to be the winner of the occam's razor competition for that one.,220
12Xpert,i do post the pre-match odds for those who want to run their models to find value. but unlike for the main leagues i don't then include this data in the final results files just the closing odds. hope that makes sense.,218
12Xpert,so what looks like an intentional position being taken by the bookmaker is in fact being forced on them. you couldn't make the under reward twice that of the over because then the public would not bet 2 :1  overs to unders.,223
12Xpert,well i think subconsciously or otherwise a collection of people on average are pretty good at knowing a fair price. wisdom of crowds and all that. whether that's woc or wisdom of sharps and squares suffering anchoring bias it doesn't really matter.,248
12Xpert,if your thesis is correct mark then you still benefit personally from the extra volume coming to the exchanges. it always surprises me how many people doing exactly what a bookmaker is doing are so quick to pass moral judgement on them.,236
12Xpert,"further i think  point about the inability to short this market increasing the probability of a bubble would consequentially increase the probability that there are more ""winners"" who fail to understand the distinction between the two ideas and the reasons for them",265
12Xpert,"there's due diligence and there's due diligence. hsbc royal bank of scotland and bnp paribas are just 3  of the countless investors who presumably did ""due diligence"" into bernard l. madoff investment securities. rich people investing in something doesn't imply it's safe.",272
12Xpert,refer to previous comments. market size appears to correlate with profits. most customers winners. most assets increased in value. market driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals. i don't think it's a scam but it appears to have the hallmarks of a bubble/ponzi.,265
12Xpert,licenced bookmakers would not do business with those games/leagues. they would lose their licence if they did. the reason it's a small percentage and only in pockets is because the sort of cheating eats itself. it can't be sustained. check game theory.,252
12Xpert,and at least the pyckio tipsters have the credibility to only use a sharp book. then we can be sure if someone actually has tipping ability as opposed to simply knowing that a soft book is offering loss leaders for advertising purposes.,236
12Xpert,with respect to winners often i hear the argument that losers deserve it for being stupid. much religious teaching alternatively takes the view that seeking to gain property at the expense of another through skill and knowledge amounts to cheating and fraud.,258
12Xpert,most punters are looking for short term rewards. this sort of product doesn't really deliver that. both websites don't get much traffic compared to reasonably sized online bookmaker. fi is also registered in jersey and hence company reports are difficult to obtain.,265
12Xpert,i don't think the number of ways matters. you have to follow a particular route and and as soon as you make a mistake it's over. i just feel for a skilled pro variance in throwing has a bigger impact than cuing.,211
12Xpert,but since you ask a lot. 7  figures over 2  decades. it's treated me well i've been lucky. and i often think about who may have contributed to that and how that might have affected their lives. i'm not immune to that.,217
12Xpert,i don't have the answer either hence my question to stimulate debate earlier today. the more we talk about it sensibly and openly putting all positions on the table and ruling out none the more chance of reaching a wise conclusion right?,237
12Xpert,"balanced thread on the different perspectives at play with respect to uk bookmakers' treatment of winning players and the moral and legal landscape. perhaps  might like to add his 2 p's worth. 
p.s. winning = bookmaker considers customer to hold expected value.",261

12Xpert,incidentally just to be a little controversial it's why socialism is always going to fail because fundamentally it's trying to force square peg (equality) into round hole (natural asymmetry/inequality) really its failure is how it's tried to do it: often with totalitarianism.,276

12Xpert,they do. and we know the chances of you beating the closing line by 3  %  plus margin over this sample because of luck is zero. which does imply that you or at least the information that you hold moves lines.,208
12Xpert,p-value is not relevant with this. if you understand how it works youll know why and what you should be doing instead to test whether its working as expected. youre a clever lad so im sure you can figure it out.,211

12Xpert,i was drawing a distinction between major league woc (which conforms to expectation) and minor league woc (which underperforms expectation). i suggested that this relative difference arises because minors are less liquid and less efficient relative to majors. not nonsense imo,276
12Xpert,but at no point could we be really confident of a strong statistically significant difference from zero (expectation). t-scores are roughly equivalent to standard deviations from expectation. anything over about 2  implies 5  %  p-value 2 .3  about 1  %  p-value.,263
12Xpert,why isn't it easy? it's a winner takes all market where link between inputs (data intelligence)  outputs (profit) are non-linear driven by feedback and leverage. tiny advantages translate into big disparities in success. that's why only a small  %  are winners.,261

12Xpert,it's much easier to run this business model (just ask  and has historically been the preferred one in the uk. i just believe that you should be fully transparent with customer what business model you operate and who you won't welcome.,234
12Xpert,of course your brand is not alone in this. but it needs to be changed so customers know where they stand and don't waste their time trying to become +ev especially when some of the adverts encourage them to do that.,215
12Xpert,bet3 6 5  opening odds versus  not as good as  using the method inspired by  5 3 8  contributes about 1 6 .5  %  of the signal relative to bet3 6 5 . against pinnacle it was just 4  % .,185
12Xpert,yes pretty much. there will be a few seconds difference between collecting pinny odds from oddsportal and the market maximums from betbrain. and there may be some errors due to oddsportal and/or betbrain using bookies' apis which are out of date.,246
12Xpert,i get that recreational bookmakers will close +ev punters but surely you got to let them prove that they are.  is historically the most famous brand in the uk so its truly pathetic to see whats happened to their online business.,228
12Xpert,this is great. i could beat your performance with exactly your bets 9  %  of the time simply by guessing. i will pin this tweet so i can keep checking your results tracker to see if you disappear if you fail.,208

12Xpert,just as a thought experiment how many people do you know that have had currently have or probably had or currently have (based on cough and fever symptoms) covid-1 9 ? what is that as a percentage of people you know?,216
12Xpert,i can still see lots of lines at bet3 6 5 . maybe the big tournament meets will go but this thing can operate without the need for those. people can be playing and self isolating. just needs a management platform.,213
12Xpert,i'd agree and those things should be easy to legislate for but it's the biliferous hatred spewing from both sides either obsessed about identity or obsessed about people who are obsessed about identity that is so unpleasant. intolerant people shout loudest.,257

12Xpert,yes i am a fan i'm just being ironic if i was cleverer i'd be trying to do some more modelling like this myself. even if it might no give away a golden goose it will have loads of good ideas.,191
12Xpert,surely there's one. but maybe he voted in the other group which would make his whole intervention pointless and serve only to confirm that his motivation is to ridicule me (as it typically is). or maybe he didn't vote at all.,225
12Xpert,i guess when people dont like something they will always have an explanation for why its bad and change the narrative each time the facts change. a case of confirmation bias leading people into a sunk cost fallacy cul de sac.,225
12Xpert,the argument from ignorance: an assertion that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. such an argument is a fallacy in informal logic.,225
12Xpert,you for low odds and high value you can have some very large stakes. fine for homo economicus who can cope with variance not so fine for homo sapiens who is not so good at that. joe peta offers some explanation.,211
12Xpert,like supermarket 'buy one get one half price' won't mean the supermarket will make less. on that product yes but overall the strategy will be to make more profit. that's why it exists. everything that is done is to maximise profit.,231
12Xpert,well i'd always assumed draws were basically an impossible beast and those systems you people bang on about are nothing more than data mining. but i guess this shows that even for draws the market 'knows' how to spot a draw.,224
12Xpert,i think it's easy to become obsessed with the concept of efficiency. is it more likely that one can become obsessed thinking it's real and making mistakes because it's not or thinking it's not real but making mistakes because it is?,232
12Xpert,i think rubbishing efficiency has become as fashionable as efficiency once was. it's like newton and einstein. the former works in most cases and the latter just tweaks things a bit but the differences are not large except in extreme cases.,240
12Xpert,"yes sharps were always exactly 5 0  % . 
i did apply a 2 :1  squares bias in favour of a and broadly got the same outputs provided the amount of attention the bookmaker gives to square action was similarly biased.",213
12Xpert,could not agree more. one thing i've learned over the years is that if you're onto a good thing and you have any sizeable following whatsoever... keep your damn mouth shut. you're only damaging your wallet by trying to help others.,231
12Xpert,i don't doubt you and every time writers from  drivel on about horrors of gambling i take the opportunity to point out the missed opportunities for teaching probabilistic thinking via our education system since it translates into better judgement under uncertainty.,265
12Xpert,nothing that limits the proportion of possible winners? where resources are limited this makes absolutely no sense at all. competition for limited resources in iterative relative-skills competitions implies the proportion of winners has to be limited. and it's almost always small,280
12Xpert,final point sums them up. thiem has weapons and could win gss when the goats go off to graze but unless zverev changes something he'll never with anything significant that's played over 5  sets. just doesn't do enough except serve well.,236
12Xpert,yes in theory but if balancing square money pushes price to far from true it will get hammered by sharp money and then the balanced action is lost. im arguing that the interplay of these variables is complex and highly sensitive.,229
12Xpert,it depends if we're talking about absolute or relative skill. absolute forecasting skills are probably considerably better than they were 5 0  years ago but that doesn't mean any more will win as a percentage of the total population of players.,244
12Xpert,"you're just assuming it's a biased sample.

the thing i like about clv whether or not it accurately predicts roi is that it's very quickly obvious that something non random is taking place. it is not nearly as fast with results.",228
12Xpert,it is at the scale of a single point resolution. that doesn't prove that there isn't something going on at a smaller scale within those single points it's just with these data sets it's impossible to find it if it exists.,221
12Xpert,i presume the book reporting the 7  figure loss is a recreational so indeed the may push the market away from the sharp number by more than the vig. did they report what that loss was as a percentage? probably not.,214
12Xpert,assuming an economics ph.d. student hasn't done it already i think it would make for an interesting thesis to model the non-linearity of the system's response to incremental increases in the amount of shading in a typically biased market like over/under.,254
12Xpert,"still laughable mark? 
it's this sort of substandard journalism that's laughable and even more laughable that there's so much of it about. i guess people want to be fed their daily dose of confirmation bias eh? otherwise why keep reading it.",241
12Xpert,have a read. explains why so few people win where there is the possibility of accumulative advantage as their is in iterative games of zero-sum betting of which fi is just one example along with all other forms of speculation (finance/betting/poker).,250
12Xpert,no i'm quite clear. almost all tipsters are useless. it's folk like you who are unbalanced giving far more weight to the winners you see when they only account for less than 1  %  (maybe less than 0 .1  % ).,207
12Xpert,as such then gambling whether via luck (diabolic) or skill (cheating) is intrinsically bad. so indeed when winners take the moral high ground with others they might consider being a little more circumspect about what it is they are actually doing.,247
12Xpert,further financial markets are only considered wealth creating because of the flawed way we treat waste. clearly there are detrimental consequences for turning natural capital into human and social goods. arguably we haven't costed those properly as greta thunberg points out.,275
12Xpert,yes it would but that doesn't deal with over confidence which every bettor suffers from (if they didn't there would be almost no betting). and it doesn't deal with hope and anticipation. these are trickier things since they are hardwired (dopamine).,249
12Xpert,no chance i would be hopeless. ive managed something like a 5  year annualised return of 1 1  %  against a benchmark performance of 3  %  but from memory that wasnt statistically significant. just got lucky picking higher variance products imo.,244
12Xpert,the  along with those who make it their first choice read and politicians which it supports are as a generalisation top down thinkers who prefer to believe in 'leader-inspired systems for the people'. moral prohibition is a common theme amongst them.,250
12Xpert,"i now understand the the original piece header was changed from ""reliance on loss-making customers"" (which will be factually verifiable and a statement of the obvious"") to ""reliance on problem gamblers"" (which has not been verified by a published source).",255
12Xpert,but traders at these bookies don't come cheap and that is because they are really good at setting lines probably many were sharp players before encouraged to jump sides. hence their opening lines will be hard to beat (on average).,230
12Xpert,what i do think should be legislated for is the instance that bookmakers are clear to customers about what bookmaking model they are operating. and their defence that this would be bad for business is not a sufficiently strong defence.,235
12Xpert,ensemble or voting algorithms are when a number of ml algorithms eg nn knn random forest have their predictions aggregated. a sort of woc applied to ml  i have just implemented voting into the mysportsai software and it looks promising,235
12Xpert,i would assume so although i dont have sufficient data to test it. ive been collecting their total goals odds this season. will probably need a couple of seasons to reliably analyse it. perhaps others have already done it.  ?,225
12Xpert,i think this is the same explanation for why the tories are always seen as nasty and labour seen as empathetic (because often the former has felt it had to use austerity to pay for the overspending of the latter).,213
12Xpert,"""public discourse in this country would be more civilised productive and robust if the left were less sanctimonious less smugly certain of the righteousness of their cause and more sensitive to the fact that everyone doesnt see things their way.""",246
12Xpert,1 .0 1 0 7  will almost certainly not happen by chance (see ) so clearly you're bringing information to the market but it's not enough to overcome the margin. of course clvh could all be wrong. that's another story.,215
12Xpert,anyway this is what a general election is for. if enough people agree with him then his model gets tested. if not then it doesn't and that's the end of that for a generation apparently (well according to corbyn anyway).,219
12Xpert,top down ideology like marxism likes to believe it can impose things on people if it thinks it is right. history show that either people eventually find ways of circumnavigating the impositions they don't like or millions of people die.,236
12Xpert,i agree no excuse. but does that mean i should judge her by her standards with the sort of language she uses? she had a convent school education. i imagine that can influence a person in all sorts of ways.,205
12Xpert,taking a look at the difference of xg and goals scored we see a negative skewed distribution. teams more often slightly undercut their xg. but the most extrem situations occur on the other side where teams overperform their xg value.,233
12Xpert,almost no one is actually good. that's not saying no one is good. but it is saying it is hard to find those who are and the journey to them will likely involve loss making unless you are very lucky.,198
12Xpert,"to fair prices (margin removed):
colder teams -0 .1 7  %  avg odds 3 .7 9

12Xpert,"a score for a team in a match is defined by:

12Xpert,but the point of my little thought experiment was that if they only had customers taking best prices they would have to close all accounts and they would have no business hence they would be forced to change their model.,220
12Xpert,i'm not asking you to forget those 8  years. i'm asking you to understand that just because you (may) have done it and you can see yourself that this implies everyone else is doing it. we only see the winners.,209
12Xpert,good question. speculating here but its conceivable that elements of gambling evolved (culturally speaking) from sacrifice. gambling involves 3  elements: a consideration (stake) a risk (chance) and a reward. the first represents skin in the game giving something up (sacrifice),278
12Xpert,"""a cultural revolution has been underway... which... perceives the liberalism of the late 2 0 th century as an aberration in a long history of moral distaste for gambling  and seeks to return the activity to the margins of society.""",232

the vast majority can enjoy this without addiction.",267
12Xpert,i think the best thing that ever happened to me was my first attempt at implementing a system with real money started with 8 /1 0  losses. i got cold feat and abandoned it. i've been a sceptic ever since.,204
12Xpert,just do the science will you? you evidently know the things that have to be done to be a 7  %  yield winner. so go find hundreds of the buggers doing those things and then let's study how they perform.,201
12Xpert,that's a different question not addressed by the model. in it that assume it's normally distributed and is quasi-related to intelligence. but talent may not be that at all. indeed it make not even exist. everything could just be chance.,236

12Xpert,betfair are now offering exchange customers 2  %  commission rate provided they give up best odds guarantee and other promotions. for sharper customers who'll get banned for profitably exploiting those that seems like a good deal. what am i missing?,249
12Xpert,it does but that's not the question i'm asking. i want to know if the difference between expected and actual is statistically significant. if it is then this supports  if it isn't we have to carry on believing in clvh.,218
12Xpert,too bad. in 2 0 0 8  i tuned down oddsportal/flashscore to be their uk bookie advertising programme manager because they wanted to do fixed fee rather affiliate rev share and i told them the bookies wouldnt go for that.,219
12Xpert,ok but still a smaller sample compared to the one i used. i have seen the same as you from my data so i was surprised to see the log method closest of all of them to 0  % .,172
12Xpert,which is precisely the problem with the eu. it's become a political project still pretending to be an economic one but not telling the electorates the full truth about how it's going to have to go so ensure it survives.,219
12Xpert,presumably people who want to remain in the eu would never ask the question because they would always deny that it would be possible to not fall off a cliff. just confirmation bias. behind a paywall. what did it conclude?,221
12Xpert,politics  economics are near-zero validity environments where links between cause and effect are weak or non existent and randomness and uncertainty dominant. predictions in this domain are at best guestimate scenarios and at worst totally worthless. rather like sports betting.,278
12Xpert,brenner  brenner in gambling  speculation present an argument based on historical social prejudice. i have sympathy with this one give that typically it has been 'lower' social classes which have indulged and 'higher' social classes which have moralised and prohibited.,269
12Xpert,i don't really think that response is appropriate either. for sure learning to think probabilistically is what i'm talking about in part but there are better ways of encouraging reflection on personal responsibilities than shaming a person with an addiction,257
12Xpert,they won't call them affiliates any more they call them third party arrangements even though they use exactly the same affiliate tracking software. it was simply cost saving measure they never had the courage to admit to in my opinion.,235
12Xpert,thanks to  for drawing my attention to  's amazing thread about jeff friedman's book war and chance which i suspect will be the best-in-class since  's expert political judgement. learning how to deal with uncertainty has so many life benefits.,244
12Xpert,there are lots of things that chip away at family budgets. going to the cinema sky tv going to football games flying in planes. smoking drinking. some are socially harmful in excess. some environmentally damaging. what's morally special about gambling?,252
12Xpert,"in our latest series skill vs. randomness we will see how our  traders come up against a rng so we can determine if it really comes down to skill or luck?   

*odds subject to change 

get the best odds  :",205
12Xpert,i would expect not. analysed a few recent seasons in my last book and they were negative. the document is really more to show how to develop and test a rating system rather than something that definitely a winning system.,221
12Xpert,i would be reluctant to say that these profitable intra-sample subsets are anything other than data mining and luck but one can't rule out the possibility that you might have more ability at some kinds of bets than other kinds.,227
12Xpert,that may happen. but suppose nish identifies contrarian positions where there are enough squares in the market to allow pinny to maintain a technically inefficient position up to closing because it makes them more money. then it may not happen.,244
12Xpert,but add a margin of 5  %  (odds -1 1 0  or 1 .9 0 9 ) and any profit available from being a contrarian almost entirely disappears (assuming it was statistically significant in the first place which is debatable).,212
12Xpert,[1 /2 ] you presumed that i thought your contributions were neutral to negative. i have never thought that (although sometimes i find it hard to unpick what you're saying probably because you know a lot more than i do).,219
12Xpert,but this is possible too. and if my theory is correct (it has to be for wocs to work) then this deviation happens by chance. in this example p-value = 0 .1 4  i.e. nothing for me to worry about.,194
12Xpert,pinnys price is better because to a significant extent the wisdom comes from sharp players (as well as squares cancelling  out their respective errors) with no systematic desire to bias a market for things like advertising to attract new customers.,248
12Xpert,"thanks we have a dialogue channel. with regard to  campaign i read it was ""developed after extensive research consultations with academic experts and several waves of focus groups with frequent sports bettors."" any published references you can direct me to?",257
12Xpert,make a hypothesis that these things will make you a millionaire and test if it works don't work backwards from all the millionaires you see and look at what they did. it turns causality on its head and is flawed.,212
12Xpert,"i'll happily agree with that criticism and your interpretation of what's happening. i use ""winners v losers"" really as a metaphorical simplification. this was from my last book maybe it's closer to what you are talking about (hope it's readable).",246
12Xpert,"4  midweek main leagues game playing (1  woc): 

this weekend is easter and lower english leagues play friday/saturday with another round monday. data for the first lot will be available saturday night. fixtures for the second will be available sunday.",252
12Xpert,"combined performance of  and  selections since inception

12Xpert,this means that provided league 1  and league 2  players will accept a 5 0  %  pay cut then they wont lose their jobs. government should also be providing further business relief to clubs to get them through this time.,218
12Xpert,"not going to be much left to bet on soon.

now islamist terrorists climate change fanatics and anti-gambling paternalists alike all know how to stop what they don't like. all the information was all already there in 1 2  monkeys.",229
12Xpert,obviously. that's not the point. if i'm a gambling addict  reader i'm going to see those ads. if  thinks these licences should be revoked then he should also be asking his paper to deactivate gambling ads which is technically possible.,235
12Xpert,yes. 1 .3 5  %  from 7 7 9 5  closing odds (average 3 .7 6 ) from the coldest teams. can't tell you if the system is still significant nor indeed whether the original statistical significance was ever valid.,207
12Xpert,as do people who are forced write in english for whom it is not their native language. whatever i may think about their behaviour as tipsters or otherwise i am always in awe at how they do it so well.,200
12Xpert,no not really. but i'm never the one who shows up in his timeline posting explicit or implicit criticism of his work criticism that then isn't supported by any data analysis proving an alternative point of view to be correct.,225
12Xpert,it's not an argument to attempt to disprove this by saying look at me or him he has profit. there are other tools to use closing line value for example. but again on this i get rubbished for saying it.,201
12Xpert,behavioural economics is all wrong. it underestimates the utility of fear  greed instead dressing it up as cognitive bias. on the contrary it is perfectly rational for homo sapiens indeed even her twin homo economicus to be fearful and greedy.,243
12Xpert,it's hard to answer that question because i don't have enough data to answer it. i've seen tipsters make a profit in efficient markets but my analysis tells me that almost all have been luck because almost all mean regress.,223
12Xpert,"was wondering when youd show up.

just waiting for skilled professionals like your good self to come to me with a business proposition. you show me how to win and ill pay you handsomely. still waiting for my first approach.",223
12Xpert,"if all losers stopped playing there wouldn't be much of a market left from which the bookmakers could pay the sharps would there. 
losers pay for winners and no amount of trolley-problem hypothesising about this is going to change that.",236
12Xpert,"ev = odds you bets divided by 'true' odds (your model obviously needs to be better than other models for this bit).

then full kelly  %  = ev -1  / odds - 1

where 'odds' is the odds you bet.",191
12Xpert,im not saying you wouldnt im saying the amount you can do that is constrained. both by sharps and then more savvy squares and also by arbers. the size of the margin seems to me to represent an obvious limit.,207
12Xpert,furthermore if natural systems on which our economies are built flip to dramatically different and potentially chaotic environments no longer beneficial for human activity those indices will experience black swan events making their overall history look distinctly more 0 -sum.,277
12Xpert,i happen to believe that the causal link between the vulnerability of people and the freedom to advertise is hugely tenuous but is typically assumed by those wishing to curtail the latter as having almost 1 0 0  %  r-squared.,225
12Xpert,you're right for 9 9  %  it's no better than throwing darts. that's because the rewards for winning are being better than others at forecasting not just being good at forecasting. for most players their skills just cancel themselves out.,237
12Xpert,a tipster with 2 0 0  thousand + followers who doesnt understand decimal odds. lets test the credibility of the size of this fan base by retweeting. if the majority is not fake we should get plenty of interaction here.,218
12Xpert,"let's ask an anti-gambling mp whether she thinks the management of legal pastime is morally equivalent to the management of an illegal one. unbelievable that anyone might think that's a good idea. a bit like her homophobic ""office banter"" pathetic.",248
12Xpert,they bet and if they win they take money off people who lose including addicts. just as a bookie. if bookies did none of those things you perhaps rightly highlight there would still be people who say they are bad.,213
12Xpert,but you should ask yourself why it is that you have all been winning. because you all know lots about player valuations and trading them? or because the whole market is inflating due to an exponential supply of new money?,221
12Xpert,i've not seen that but at a quick glance i'd say it's not quite the same thing. ballstreettrading appears to hinge on the short-time frame of in-play so i would assume would be like a version of in-play spread betting.,218
12Xpert,"similar here: 
they still view it favourably despite the concerns. it just very much seems to me to be a product built on the quicksands of market sentiment rather than fundamentals as  has pointed out. time of course will tell.",228
12Xpert,but just to be clear this figure is not the probability that it's because of skill. no calculator like this can tell you that. deciding whether you think skill is the reason and not luck is a subjective judgement here.,218
12Xpert,"you really should stop putting words into my mouth. i'll say it again.

""what sort of sucker pays for luck?""

unless i'm confused that's is no the same as saying...

""buying tips is for idiots.""

which i've actually never said.",227
12Xpert,no. that's stupid. in-play is too fast for this to be a legitimate enterprise unless you offer your clients automated bet placement with guaranteed prices. i know you love in-play but you really should stop insisting i care about it.,233
12Xpert,i'm old school. unless you are investing for structural things for example a home or perhaps a car if you haven't got it don't spend it. it's not gambling that gotten people into trouble it's society's love affair with credit.,226
12Xpert,indeed that could be an issue but it is a separate one. but given that bookmakers and exchanges have typically been the organisations calling out match fixing and helping authorities with investigations can't we assume there is no danger here?,243
12Xpert,i certainly don't claim to have all the answers just my perspectives but i'd like to think that i ask better questions (and offer some ideas to them) than most who now appear to be indulging this fad of gambling-bashing.,220
12Xpert,"well that was a euphemism for the ex mp who was talking about it on bbc radio 5  live this morning. 

but i suppose more generally there has been a moral pendulum swing against gambling in the last few years.",208
12Xpert,similar. it's a winner-takes-all relative-skills market. i attempted to model this in my book (badly) with just 6  players. in the end the one with the most skill destroys the rest. the bookie's vig is simply like an uber-skilled player.,237
12Xpert,(in)efficiency is simple a matter of scale or sample size. at the most discrete (single trade odds etc) everything by definition will be inefficient (inaccurate). at the population scale (everything) it's all perfectly efficient (probability of 1  that something happens).,272
12Xpert,please show the source for your numbers.  can show you her source if you ask for it. can you do the same or are just making up a number you want to be true to fit your belief system?,182
12Xpert,but the point is we don't know whether these high rolling players are much more likely to be addicts (1 1  times more likely).  and  just say it's a secret source. that's not science. but it might be bs.,203
12Xpert,as for saying restrictions weren't a deliberate strategy that is simply semantic equivocating at best (sportsbook ceos are good at this) and complete horse shit at worst. restrictions have to be an integral part of a recreational sportsbook model.,247
12Xpert,it might be that there's a reason why this should be a special case. certainly point of consumption taxes was applied to the offshore industry in such a way. i haven't seen this extended to the likes of amazon.,210
12Xpert,that's basically it. they operate for the 9 5  %  who just don't care about value and just want to have a good time recreationally and if you forced a model change there would be less for those customers.,204
12Xpert,"here's what it looks like with my data from 2 0 1 0  to 2 0 1 9 .
2 0 1 9  is an aberration. 2 0 1 7  was even more with dogs profitable at closing prices.",155
12Xpert,a fascinating read about a fascinating character and the past and future of sports betting in the us. makes me realise how all the more remarkable it was for patrick veitch to achieve what he did with uk bookmakers.,215
12Xpert,brilliant. unsurprisingly it's top heavy because there is a lower goals limit (zero) but theoretically no upper goals limit. taking that into account it looks quite normally distribution with the exception possibly of one or two outliers e.g. messi.,249
12Xpert,on economic matters i find it interesting that jc fears boris would turn this county into a tax haven for multinationals. so much like one of his favourite friends ireland which he conveniently seems to either forget or ignore.,227
12Xpert,these twitter tipsters dont sell tips. they make money from bookmaker affiliation. it remains unclear to me whether they know they offer negative expectation advice or whether they are blind to it because of young male testosterone driven overconfidence.,254
12Xpert,probably because theyre looking to attract new customers with these silly bets. to my knowledge there is no sharp efficient bookmaker offering such markets so its impossible to have a reliable measure of true odds and hence offer woc.,234
12Xpert,"i have neither the need nor the motivation to use these ""ways"" (was banned long ago by most) but others do and whilst soft books continue to employ a soft book business model people are welcome to continue trying.",213
12Xpert,and when you're done with that have a read of something i wrote in 1 9 9 7  (updated 1 9 9 9 ) about climate change. aimed at university students but any reasonably educated person can follow it.,195
12Xpert,i don't think that was the point of the analogy. i understood it to imply that both flat earthers and gamblers suffer from the illusion that they are taking back control. hmm where have i heard that phrase before?,213
12Xpert,of course if your odds are not randomly distributed this might account for why you've had a longer than expected losing run. if you have a lot of long odds grouped together then obviously that's going to change things.,218
12Xpert,obviously calculator is suited for simple bet scenarios with the sames odds and stakes but i've tested it against monte carlo and it's reasonably robust provided odds or stakes don't vary too much for example asian handicap/point spread betting.,245
12Xpert,all of s sudden these kinda people are filling my twitter feed with their ads. ive taken to blocking them immediately. so should everyone. 9 9  %  of them will be tossing coins and they wont even know it.,204
12Xpert,"liverpool are in the same place as the 1 0 0  pointer man city 2 0 1 7 /1 8  team were. 
if they maintain their current pace (2 .8 0  pts/game) they would accumulate 1 0 6  points.",180
12Xpert,and in near-zero validity environments like betting trading financial speculation the signal is much smaller than the noise and link between cause and effect is small study those things many times and study many people doing the same things.,241
12Xpert,you just don't understand survivorship bias do you. why don't you go away and make your money without annoying me and confusing others who might not be aware of the dangers of survivorship bias when thinking about following tipsters.,233
12Xpert,"well quite. as several notable individuals have said ""better to be lucky than smart."" i think  would agree. ""luck is the grand equalizer."" presumably in near-zero validity environments with pareto-distributed performance outcomes luck is far more influential than skill.",270
12Xpert,i was never actually talking about tipsters in this thread and the odds were pinnacle closing. it's simply an exercise in illustrating how easy it is to be fooled by your own profits. nothing here had any skill whatsoever.,222
12Xpert,timeline showing the 2 0 1 9 -2 0   title race based on my predictions (method at ) as a function of date.  overtake  as title favourites after a dramatic weekend! this will be updated every week. data by,204
12Xpert,after 7  weeks and only the longshot bias seems to be making a profit still very early days. thanks to  for the data and  for the odds i am using to analyse.  - full write up to follow soon,189
12Xpert,that's correct. seems to me that if you know what you're doing with bog they'll ban you anyway so taking 2  %  on the exchange is surely a good option. the alternatives are 5  %  and 8  % .,189
12Xpert,no because we dont know what the reason is. if there is only one tipster who does this then it makes it more likely that its just chance. if other tipsters are systematically doing this then it gets interesting.,211
12Xpert,...how newspapers should behave provided the behaviour under scrutiny is within existing law. yes politicians can change the law but when this involves press freedoms including those to offend they do so a great risk. that was my point.,236
12Xpert,on the basis of the data i analysed i don't agree that tennis is fully efficient. i haven't determined from this data if the source of this efficiency lies with the smaller events only or also extends to atp/wta.,212
12Xpert,and worth retweeting the original resource. the presence of parameter uncertainty does not imply markets were inefficient they are just learning or rather being updated by bayesian statisticians otherwise known as bettors. some bs's are better than other bs's,259
12Xpert,for an environmentalist i feel that one way to increase the likelihood of bringing people with their arguments is to refrain from using emotive (and intentionally critical and insulting) language like the word 'denier'. it weaponises and polarises debate.,255
12Xpert,maybe at the same time we end up with fewer gambling addicts. gambling is a natural part of life like eating and drinking. all of those things taken to excess in one way or another aren't good for us.,200
12Xpert,of course you could check whether you're beating closing prices and/or causing prices movements. with softbooks happy to post inefficient opening prices and their willingness to ban customers these movements are a certainty for those who exploit such prices.,258
12Xpert,until the eu assumes the legal and moral authority of a nation then any decisions it makes that are of nationally constitutional importance should be put to a vote in member nations. the eu is not (yet) a nation.,212
12Xpert,if anyone can get addicted to gambling (yes please show us the peer-reviewed references) then we have to ask why that might be (risking taking is an evolutionary beneficial strategy  which can become egodystonic where resources are unlimited perhaps?).,252
12Xpert,and more reasons to be concerned the  is only waging a moral crusade against gambling rather than to actually offer positive comment about the role gambling might play in helping people become better decision makers in domains of uncertainty.,242
12Xpert,not at all. hardly any lie or fake their records. the problem is that almost all touts are blind to the fact that they have no ability beyond luck. to the customer blindness and lying however have similar outcomes.,214
12Xpert,that's what capitalism is josephine. adam smith's invisible hand (unintended social benefits arise from individuals self-interested actions) is completely compatible with the darwinian evolution of a social animals like homo sapiens. he also wrote the theory of moral virtue.,275
12Xpert,"this thread from  is amazing so much to unpack in it. every word is worth reading. 

especially endorse this from war and chance: to say that a judgment is subjective does not mean that it is careless or uninformative",217
12Xpert,i adopt the stephen hawking approach of forgetting about what reality is or might be and focusing instead on model dependent reality. does your model match what you observe? if yes it's probably a pretty good explanation of reality.,232
12Xpert,i don't wish to downplay the terrible consequences on some families of problem gambling but we should keep perspective. for nearly everyone gambling like the cinema smoking drinking and going on holiday is fun it makes dopamine and serotonin.,242
12Xpert,but whatever one says about him hes still one of the greatest ever. fabulous semi final either would have been a worthy winner but credit to thiem for holding his nerve. nadal will have his work cut out tomorrow.,212
12Xpert,you know that i typically don't agree with blocking people but perhaps he doesn't take too kindly to your critical approach without having actually read the book. why not read it first and then make your comments on that.,221
12Xpert,"it would appear theres a decent level of interest for my book idea. ive decided to go for it. i plan on writing it in july and releasing it tentatively in august.

12Xpert,we're lucky to have such great guests on the  podcast. in the latest episode matt from  explains how strokes gained kick-started a golf revolution and why the sport still has room to develop (for both the fans and bettors).,223
12Xpert,that will be a factor but i doubt it's the major one. compare closing efficiency for  versus  and see what you find. the later will be relatively speaking garbage like they are for most other aspects of their business.,218
12Xpert,"cambridge dictionary define ""savvy"" as ""practical knowledge and ability."" i'm guessing that this is different to guesswork chance luck and randomness. if you show anything other than the latter you will get restricted. hence how are these adverts acceptable?",258
12Xpert,who have a legal duty to do this have also recently failed in conjunction with  to fulfil their legal role of ensuring clarity  thus fairness in a contract. it just seems like all regulators are against the gambling consumer,224

12Xpert,it doesn't matter whether it doesn't work like this most of the time. my point is that even where the betting is random much of the time the bookmaker may find himself exposed on one side just by chance.,203
12Xpert,ahh right. so let's do a ttest on your actual profits/losses (unit stakes) versus expected profits for your whole sample. =ttest(a:ab:b2 3 ) should do in it excel (your profits/losses in column a and expected profits in column b).,230

12Xpert,it's an interesting observation you make. when i talk about 'true' odds it's with these known biases removed. of course that then implies we know exactly how the bookmakers apply the bias in the first place which we don't.,222
12Xpert,reads like the apocalypse. ill wager that things will look perfectly normal within 3  seasons. lets start with the observation that now the government has nationalised the employment (sadly not self-employment) sector lower league players wagers will be underwritten.,267

12Xpert,you should be ashamed of yourselves. there is no way to improve chances of success in roulette. i thought you were a reputable group. you used to be when i verified your tips 1 5  years ago. whats happened?,206
12Xpert,perhaps  can tell you if 1 .3 5  %  from nearly 8 0 0 0  pinnacle closing odds is a real thing. unlike me he's smart. that's how he's given his subscribers 1  %  from 8 3 6  picks.,180

12Xpert,yes it was quite clear you were shooting at me too. to be clear: ive never said any of those things. there are many other ways in life to succeed besides betting. and almost all tipsters are just lucky.,202

12Xpert,however this was at recreational bookmakers not a sharp book like pinnacle. if it does apply here too it's much weaker although i have suggested it as an explanation for why pinny's closing price might not be fully efficient.,225
12Xpert,"what's the signal? and if you knew what it was before closing why would you wait to back the closing price?

this is something i wrote many year ago about steamers not steaming enough and drifters not drifting enough.",217
12Xpert,i guess because you can never know the true probability of a single event it's impossible to prove that discrepancies in samples of events that average to efficiency are not systematic which i suppose is what  was getting at.,225
12Xpert,but for sure i have been at pains to point out that there is more to gambling than money. once we factor those aspect in (dopamine) then for sure you are right this is not a zero sum game.,188
12Xpert,but with respect to the latter most will fail. so putting out the numbers about this will hopefully help people who try keep some perspective and not end up in a place where they lose their shirt and more.,205
12Xpert,"issue  being sent out today. going to talk about descriptive stats vs. predictive modelling a topic i touched in the betting podcast 

 going to develop a couple of technical indicators similar to those used in fin. trading for football",236
12Xpert,this is just an inevitable reality of relative-skills competition like betting. its a game played over and over again where tiny advantages will be compounded over large numbers of bets. hence there can only be a few true winners.,230
12Xpert,i hope to limit the mistakes people make gambling and show the phycological errors that are made. gambling should not be glorified!  explains this well in his book squares and sharps so please understand the maths! also check out,229
12Xpert,presumably if it is causal the explanation is that bookmakers shift the line to exploit squares' biased preference for betting overs. but it's so weak that we really can't rule out the possibility this it's just non-causal and random.,234
12Xpert,"used a bit of my betting knowledge to predict how this season's scottish premiership may finish.

- which order will the top 2  finish?
- who clinches 3 rd place? 
- will hearts do enough to survive?

read here",210
12Xpert,well if you come from certain christian denominations you will argue that acquiring another persons assets through the assertion of skill via a contest amounts to cheating and fraud. in which case youre a cheat and a fraud too.,227
12Xpert,well here's the problem: we don't know. why? because journalists claim this special right to keep sources secret. so what we are then left with is nothing more than astrology. i guess that's why taleb is intolerant of them.,223
12Xpert,i'm not saying i think it's a scam. i'm saying it appears to be largely driven by sentiment (greed) and not fundamentals. if/when new customers dry up or customers start withdrawing from the product we will see what happens.,224
12Xpert,going to take this opportunity to shamelessly plug my book again. chapter three is titled: to gamble or not to gamble is there a question? it's all about the morals of gambling form a historical religious and evolutionary perspective.,234
12Xpert,further could someone please explain to me why an intrinsic link between sports and gambling would be considered so appalling when the whole of western society is intrinsically linked to the management of risk and uncertainty via financial markets.,248
12Xpert,"i don't know the precise figure they don't tell me. 

by ""lose"" we are talking losing expectation. my belief is that it's 9 9  %  and i'd wager closer to 1 0 0  %  than 9 9  % .",177
12Xpert,"i wonder if  was one of those ""analysed"" in the  ""secret report"" looking at the dependence by the gambling industry on high-spending vips customers who are disproportionately likely to be addicts according to 

pots and kettles spring to mind.",243
12Xpert,so misdirecting people by falsely associating pareto distribution of deposits with losses accrued by addicts? such intended misdirection would imply the authors are familiar with societal-wide pareto distributions and the 'mechanisms' behind them; that is not at all clear.,273
12Xpert,"what would be nice to see is the bookmakers just being a bit more transparent about these things. i think they would win support. admitting that they won't accept ""sharp"" players would not damage business in my view.",216
12Xpert,there are lots of winners br but they are lucky. these are allowed it's the sharp winners the recreational books don't want. hence ads that give the idea that savvy thinking is welcomed or encouraged should be banned.,217
12Xpert,the majority of punters don't read a paywall newspaper either. those who are banned already know why and i don't think it's particularly insightful to criticise dc. instead talk about why recreational bookmaking exists in the first place.,238
12Xpert,"why do you think pinnacle don't (can't) operate in the uk? they couldn't afford to. too much tax to pay for a model like theirs.

consensus by definition means both sides agree. if one doesn't = no consensus.",208
12Xpert,and it allows them to offer far more markets than an exchange or market-making bookmaker again an advertising plus point. but this also necessitate the banning of those clever enough to know how to find the loss-leading value.,226
12Xpert,"this sounds like the classic remoaner argument. you forgot ""stupid"".

when will you understand that telling people they are these things is precisely the reason boris is still prime minister. they are sick of your shit like this.",229
12Xpert,i'll give you my explanation. losing hurts considerably more than winning is enjoyed (so psychologists say). hence those who have to pay (middle classes) are more likely to vote than those who would be beneficiaries of wealth redistribution.,241
12Xpert,not wishing to detract from the sublime artistry of salahs goal but i suspect given the curl less than one degree difference in trajectory would have meant either hitting the near post or missing far one. totally obscene,220
12Xpert,"the theory is that closing price is the closest to the 'true' price for all pre-match prices because it contains the most info.

 does a much better job of explaining it than i can. 

obviously unavailable for in-play.",218
12Xpert,don't forget however that you prove that you're beating the closing line with skill but that doesn't necessarily imply you'll have expected profit. for that you need to beat the closing line by more than the bookmaker's margin.,227
12Xpert,"getting a second airing in 2 4  hours; people's capacity for expressing bias is fascinating.
""fundamental attribution error: the tendency to overestimate the action of others as being intentional rather than the product of random situational circumstances. """,258
12Xpert,yes for sure i know. 3 0 0 0  is nothing really. this fools many. however if we're good bayesians we can't rule inefficiency out and the larger n grows the more attention we have to give it.,190
12Xpert,"the problem with arguing for efficiency from smaller samples is whether it's simply variance that's tricking you into seeing an inefficiency.

i think in this case the inefficiency could be real but if it is it's very weak.",223
12Xpert,right but youll get different scores depending on which handicaps you use. in theory you could have a team on a big positive score and a big negative score at the same time just by using different handicaps.,207
12Xpert,"great interview from  with  who also mentions the psychological aspects of betting 

rob has quite a strong opinion on clv too which i do confirm! 

would love  to comment on what his average clv for his  plays is...",216
12Xpert,"so that's pretty close to using the harmonic mean.

yes when you forget to copy/paste the table values it can get pretty annoying if it's a memory intensive simulation. or did you find another way to do it?",206
12Xpert,"yes you will. i was restricted by many bookies many years ago doing similar things. if you want to make this method pay you will need to learn the ""dark arts"" of keeping your soft book accounts live.",199
12Xpert,this is just a mirror image argument. if you could be deliberately bad then you'd know how to be good. worst = unlucky which are normally distributed. 9 9  % + of pyckio tipsters are in that distribution.,204
12Xpert,"that is a good point too. but your mistake is that you assume without testing that there is a big difference.

if small markets were so easy more people would do them. they would then become bigger markets.",206
12Xpert,if people vote for use then i'm down with that. the problem is they hardly ever get asked about these things so that kinda reduces representative democracy to autocracy. that was one of the reasons for brexit too.,213
12Xpert,i'd recommend reading the success equation: untangling skill and luck in business sports and investing by michael mauboussin. if you google his name with luck and skill you will find some useful summaries of his thinking on this.,229
12Xpert,yes it's the full data working forward from 2 0 1 5 . you are working backwards from today so you fail to consider survivorship bias and mean regression. anyone can find a great tipster by working backwards.,207
12Xpert,i knew you would say that but it's hardly significant. here's the whole sample reordered in the same way. are you still trying to tell me that there's some causal reason why 2 0 1 5  was different?,197
12Xpert,new  predictions for 2 0 1 9 -2 0  (method: ) after the weekend games. attack strength  defence weakness ratings shown by team.  still favourites despite being held to a draw at     still to play tonight. data by,212
12Xpert,latest tennis tournaments data added linz and tianjin for wta and shanghai for atp including first singles title for coco gauff at age 1 5  nearly two years earlier than serena. just 7 1  more to catch up.,205
12Xpert,"if you're keen on following  's  selections fully automated then head over to  

here is a quick intro that should scare people away in no time  

+5 .1 4  %  roi across 3 5 1 2 7  selections",191
12Xpert,i've tried all to contact the  affiliate team twice this week but no one can be bothered to respond. your brand really is the most useless in all of bookmaker-land. i mean properly useless. perhaps  should be renamed,216
12Xpert,my calculations in the following article are not to 2  %  comm if recent reports suggesting that 2  %  comm is available to jo average then the case for betfair betting and not bookmaker betting is stronger still,212
12Xpert,week 5  roundup  thanks again to  for providing the data anyone who would like to do their own analysis should take a look at  and remember to backtest any strategy before you using any of your hard-earned cash,210
12Xpert,this from an individual who makes a living from the losses of others. just as interesting. by all means let's debate the morals of gambling. let's see if we can manage it without resorting to argumentum ad hominem.,214
12Xpert,for anyone following this thread the reality is that from just a couple of hundred tips with average odds of over 3  and the returns shown here it's effectively impossible to tell anything at all good or bad.,208
12Xpert,there are just some brands i would refuse to promote. they have contacted me many times over the years and every time i have told them what i think of their brand and where the can stick it.,190
12Xpert,anyway i'll let this go. i'm not here to cause trouble for the sake of it just want to educate punters to understand more about luck and skill. time will tell if you have any of the latter.,189
12Xpert,i actually agree with you about the eu parliament. it's elected to make decisions on our behalf in the same way that we elect a uk parliament. indirect democracy is clearly more practical than holding referendums on everything.,227
12Xpert,it's already been explained by me and others. they are the most popular global soft book and 9 9  %  of punters need soft books to have a chance of finding +ev. most of those won't get restricted.,196
12Xpert,well almost no punter is sharp enough to ever be a winner at a sharp book so i have to cater for those who aren't and still use other bookmakers. bet3 6 5  is the best of them.,176
12Xpert,not sure what the argument was here but i think it's still important to highly the cul-de-sacs that data mining can take you down if you're careful how you use it. these two quotes should do the job.,199
12Xpert,you know my views on all of this. data mining and charting in sports betting is basically alchemy whether or not the data is made up. if people want to believe in this nonsense that's their look out.,199
12Xpert,ir is very popular now because punters like it and bookmakers make more money from it (bigger margins). hence it's probably harder to beat on average but if you do the work you may find more exploitable opportunities.,217
12Xpert,the strong clvh says you shouldn't be able to beat the closing line. your study proposition is an interesting one. as i understand it you're effectively saying greater opening line variance will correlate with greater closing line variance.,240
12Xpert,economically for you it may be priceless data. but scientifically for the community if we can't see it test it and replicate it it has no value. it's like some one claiming they've built a perpetual motion machine.,214
12Xpert,would be nice if he showed it then. if this is a hypothesis then test it with empirical data like i have. if you can't or won't then it's not a hypothesis worth talking about it's just supposition.,197
12Xpert,exactly. the question for debate here is whether biases are sufficiently large to be able to exploit them for a consistent long term profit (beyond luck) once the costs of playing in the market have been accounted for.,218
12Xpert,just checking in with  are we seeing some mean regression or just bad luck? i could be the current history 1  in 6  times by guessing (was 1  in 9 ). are you planning to return next season?,189
12Xpert,if the  was ranked according to performance relative to market expectation (based on fair  match odds) this is how it would have finished. cardiff relegated despite finishing 6 th. chelsea getting champions league despite finishing 1 7 th.,239
12Xpert,i have thought about starting a new service which simply rates tipsters against the closing line. but  is sort of already doing that privately and it's still unclear whether clv is the fairest way to measure a tipster.,218
12Xpert,i charged a small fee for verification (about 1 0 0  for 3  months). the website made about 4 0  thousand  in 9  years which was far less than minimum wage given the hours i put into it.,186
12Xpert,"ht:  0  (0 .1 9  xg)
 0  (0 .3 8 )
defences on top so far in what has been a cagey first half. sterling (0 .1 7 ) has the games best chance late on.

 shot map",159
12Xpert,presumably these are book margins they dont actually show specific margin weights on odds we cant know these since we dont know how they are applied exactly. so 1 0 2  %  can still contain a f-l bias.,200
12Xpert,"for sure if i now looked at my chart i showed earlier and said ""right we're gonna drop all the 3 .5  % s because they haven't contributed anything"" then that would be technical analysis and imo mistaken.",203
12Xpert,no i would consider it more a fundamental approach in the sense that it starts with a hypothesis: pinny odds are better than other bookmaker's odds so bet the others when they are more than pinny's plus margin.,210
12Xpert,using sharps to get better idea about true prices where necessary. the end results would bee that in such a new environment some of the weaker sharps would become squares. betting is a relative skills game like poker.,217
12Xpert,good point. average 5 3 8  sample odds = 4 .1 0 . average population odds = 3 .7 5 . however i wasn't actually saying they were worse than blind betting merely not statistically different to it.,194
12Xpert,yes you're right. i am going to analyse against opening odds hopefully tomorrow. of course we still don't know precisely when 5 3 8  issue the ratings so we'll never truly be able to make a fair comparison.,206
12Xpert,no real hypothesis as such yet. just looking to see how their model's implied odds stacks up against real bookmakers. i intend to do some more on this over the next couple of days looking at relative performance.,212
12Xpert,"on 9 th january you wrote this piece about  affiliate relaunching with   
how about a follow up telling how they don't track and pay affiliates for referrals before that and how they can't or won't fix this ""problem""?",217
12Xpert,i disagree. i would say anything systematic will be withing the bounds of their margin. anything outside it will be their errors or one-off decisions. things that are systematic are much easier to spot meaning they should disappear.,232
12Xpert,no one has convinced me that draws systems don't simply mean regress because they are based on nothing. imo the only way to profit from draws is to back draw prices that are deliberately offered as loss leaders.,211
12Xpert,in the end your t-scores will be normally distributed because your systems are all based on meaningless data mining. they are already not far off from normal and we only have a sample of 1 5 3 .,194
12Xpert,no the point about things regressing to the mean is that it happens because there is nothing causal only luck. however i have written about a possible way to may be exploit others who are fooled by this.,203
12Xpert,provided they teach it in the wider context of markets and what they are for (management of uncertainty) and don't just treat risk taking as bad. given the current market climate that would be a very good idea.,210
12Xpert,but they will probably be getting a government bail out. would racing especially at a time when many including those in the commons would be happy to see its demise. some jobs are more equal than others right?,209
12Xpert,you can do country-wide lockdowns. that seems to work short term but what happens when you unlock again. does it re-spread exponentially again and then you lockdown again. repeated lockdowns are not sustainable for 1 2 + months.,228
12Xpert,give me the real pros you talk about and then lets see whether or not they mean regress. the current ones have been regressing towards zero since  started looking at them. maybe that's changed now. you tell me.,210
12Xpert,no idea mate. when i verified i recorded what i was sent. if the tipster recorded something different on their own service website i asked them why. if i didn't get a proper explanation i kicked them out.,204
12Xpert,do you honestly think you have any justification implying i have no words of wisdom to offer bettors when you evidently demonstrate yourself to be completely devoid of any understanding of variance with a mission statement like this?,233
12Xpert,but you be the judge. perhaps i really have absolutely nothing useful to say. perhaps i'm just a loser. if you tell me i can live with that. would just like to know how many really think it.,190
12Xpert,"it's all terribly confusing.

anyway taking just the favourites the winners have an average o/c of 1 .0 1 2 0 1 . the losers 1 .0 0 4 4 0 . p-value = 7 e-8 4 .",159
12Xpert,"yes perhaps.
it's so weird how mostly left wing people seem to think that right wing people seem to think that scientific consensus is somehow part of some broad conspiracy to emasculate them.
let's call it a night.",215
12Xpert,the same would apply to referees decisions but i suppose it shows we are more prepared to tolerate human error than have computers being able to make millimetre-scale decisions but fail to consider the spirit of the game.,221
12Xpert,i'm simply saying that there are limits to the amount of shading you can get away with before people start to notice in particular the arbers. humans are dumb and biased but they ain't that dumb and biased.,206
12Xpert,plumbers operate in a high validity environment where cause and effect is easily defined and skills can be accumulated via purposeful practice. that isn't the case with betting or stock picking. perhaps this paper will explain it better.,237
12Xpert,yeah i recall that too now and what you said at the time. i do also seem to remember him saying some stuff that seemed to effectively imply he was getting sick of all the shit on twitter.,187
12Xpert,for what it's worth void filling is a constant issue for me. here's a book that gave me a lot of perspective. probably the second best ever i've read. please ignore if it doesn't mean anything to you.,200
12Xpert,perhaps for you not in a betting market environment since repeated positive expectation play has changed the game for you but be sure that your endocrine system is as wired to love uncertain rewards as anyone else's is.,219
12Xpert,"when talking about ""winners"" we need to be clear what we mean. i don't mean luck winners i mean people with +ev and not just +ev that's been offered by a bookmaker who will then take it away.",191
12Xpert,how do you keep them separate when the game is played again and again and again? and how would you find 2 5  %  of people willing to fund the  lifestyles of the other 2 5  % ?,175
12Xpert,i wouldn't really use recreational books to define what i'm talking about. skybet for example have claimed they restrict about 4  %  of customers. i but could show anyone how to get restricted with them in 5  minutes.,217
12Xpert,"uncertainty drives fear. overconfidence drives greed.
given this backdrop of typical human behaviour it's highly probable the response is overblown. contrarians can seek to profit from this although part of me finds this tasteless given people have died.",254
12Xpert,im not convinced thats true either anymore. it might be what they would like but with the public being what they are its just not possible without exposing a considerable liability that would be hammered by sharp action.,220
12Xpert,of course the market is unable to consider all possible information. it is not laplace's demon. but at the 1 -point scale the failure to consider all information appears to result in random noise rather than systematic bias.,224
12Xpert,same data used as for my  article just presented differently.if there is any inefficiency it's hidden within smaller samples potentially applied on a single-match ad hoc basis. noise about the 1 :1  correlation appears random at this scale.,240
12Xpert,"throughout his career  has always seemed to find a ""way"" to disrupt his opponent at the most opportune moments. perhaps that's why despite his beautiful tennis he'll never be loved like   will have every right to feel aggrieved.",228
12Xpert,"what tool did you use for that?
they can't be very interested in what he has to say since most of his tweets have hardly any interaction.
anyway irrelevant now since he's blocked me. what a nice fella.",201
12Xpert,nice concise point of view. ive written extensively on how the vast majority of tipsters are overconfident in their abilities (which arent really abilities at all) and how they regress to the mean after you start watching them.,227
12Xpert,and suddenly that renders everything i've said invalid does it? i can see how it works. i don't need to try it to increase my understanding. i don't spread bet but that doesn't preclude me from understanding it.,211
12Xpert,and you need to find out how many customers they have and whether there's a way you can automate bet placement to minimise slippage. really i think the only viable tipster-customer relationship is a a 1 -to-1 .,210
12Xpert,"apparently ""recent studies show that around 3  %  of european adults and 8  %  of european young people may display a level of shopping addiction which could be regarded as pathological.""
if true that's way more than gambling.",226
12Xpert,and better educated punters wont increase number of winners any more than running faster increases number of olympic marathon winners. like most competitions betting is a relative skills contest where significance of accumulated advantage drives a winner-takes-all distribution.,278
12Xpert,however if it's the potential and magnitude for ruin then nothing comes close to anorexia yet i don't see society getting particularly heated about fashion advertising via size zeros in the same way. again it's probably class thing.,232
12Xpert,indeed it isn't. i guess it's just that it's now high profile english games and the english are above all this moral deviance aren't they? i mean only russians take performance enhancing not our beloved sirs and dames.,218
12Xpert,what we want to know is the probability of deviating from the expectation. but given we are then applying a  or  depending on whether the tipster over or underperforms really we should leaves these as 1 -tailed figures.,219
12Xpert,but of course if they were free and more people were putting in the effort what do think would happen? only 1  person can win the 1 0 0 m olympic final even though everyone gets quicker trying.,193
12Xpert,"beware law of small numbers

12Xpert,here's the 1 7  bets i place with stan james over 1  week some years ago before instant account closure. can you spot why they did it? clue: it's not because of the large number of wins.,186
12Xpert,"bottom line: all ""winners"" are paid for by ""losers"". when we start to moralise about bookmakers and their profits and the salaries of their ceos we should always keep this in mind. financially speaking gambling is zero-sum.",223
12Xpert,both conservative and labour manifestos were full of of the proverbial it's just that the whilst the former smelt like something your dog does the latter smelt like an entire farm yard of shit silage and urine.,210
12Xpert,i don't have that. the guys who run flashscore (livemedia) will collect this via but you would have to pay. they own a subsidiary called enetpulse who can provide this sort of thing but it's not cheap.,201
12Xpert,similarly blackpool did one season and got relegated on 3 9 . that's only 4  fewer than liverpool's worst of 4 3  and 2  more than tottenham's worst of 3 7  neither of whom have been relegated.,193

12Xpert,unlike stock picking sports betting and economic forecasting painting and decorating is a high-validity environment where practitioners can gain plenty of feedback on their professional judgements thereby strengthening them and gain expertise. sir you are a legend.,265
12Xpert,to be honest i'd bet using fractional kelly as opposed to full kelly anyway because full kelly is really only suitable for homo economicus not homo sapiens with all of its cognitive biases most particularly loss aversion.,221
12Xpert,these are not comparable problems in the same way that taleb distinguishes between firefighters and stock pickers. intuition is indeed a tried an tested evolutionary strategy in high validity domains where cause - effects links are clearer.,240
12Xpert,i know you're going to say what stupid way to vary bet win  % s using normal distribution random number generator. so give me another way. we ain't gonna see much different not over the long term.,196
12Xpert,i'll post it again. average odds 3 .4 3 . 1 0 1 8 0  bets. expected -2 .8 1  % . chance of profit 3 .3 2  % . you really think i'm going too far?,145
12Xpert,of course it still doesnt tell you anything about one specific tipster just that collectively these 2 4 9  tipsters showed a performance distribution that would look almost the same as if they were all tossing coins.,216
12Xpert,"ha 
which? sbc or ? either way no one should block you for just doing that. thats suggestive of lying to your customers.
ive done a follow up to this thought experiment for next months pinny article.",199
12Xpert,log method wont be good for racing. 2  or 3  way only. for multi runner events the shin method is better. im sure someone reading this can post the link to his paper i cant remember it.,185
12Xpert,read the article i just gave you (on pinnacle's soccer efficiency). it's not so much open to close it's any pre-close price to close or any price to another price that is relevant for determining relative efficiency.,216
12Xpert,i'm more inclined to agree with tr. a simple model that estimates the superiority of one player over another for a single point can go a long way to predicting the true odds for a match outcome.,194
12Xpert,that way people would have an answer about your skill level much sooner. unfortunately they'd also have an answer to the question of whether they will get their softbook betting accounts closed if they back your tips.,217
12Xpert,and i would be more inclined to pay attention to what they are saying if they attached serious error margins to their scenarios that properly reflected the uncertainty rather than underlying hidden political motivations or overconfidence bias.,243
12Xpert,why should society not at least explore the possibilities rather than simply writing off a behaviour that almost everyone indulges in in some way or other (for purely evolutionary reasons) and those who facilitate it as evil?,225
12Xpert,"a slight insinuation of ""you're an umempathetic bastard"". i know what i was thinking when i wrote what i wrote and concepts like fault and blame were not there. and the answer to your question is yes.",200
12Xpert,how about another market: brexit will never happen. the only way it will happen is if eu gets sick of it all. as always they hold all the cards at least until their house comes crashing down.,191

12Xpert,had to listen in chunks but this is a really good episode.  is very intelligent but also does a great job of articulating the complexities of value betting. looking forward to his collab with  (coming soon on,208
12Xpert,without data i have to keep an open mind. i am a bayesian. if i see data that means i have to update my prior belief in a hypothesis i will update it. show me the data.,168
12Xpert,the most obvious example of this is the favourite-longshot bias. but screwing people who like longshots doesn't imply those who back favourites will make a profit at least not these days and certainly not at efficient bookmakers.,229
12Xpert,particularly maddening because they breached their own tcs by not telling they had done this when they should but still withholding your account balance. i suppose some might call this business. i might consider calling it theft.,229
12Xpert,although i'd still argue that overconfidence still applies to things like roulette even if the player knows is an -ev game they can still falsely believe in things like fate faith preordination gamblers fallacy hot hand etc.,224
12Xpert,6  months since  moved their affiliate programme to  still in breach of tcs having failed to retag previous referrals allowing their partners to earn revenue from those. neither affiliate managers nor  interested. brand not fit for purpose.,240
12Xpert,perhaps i'm missing something here i'm not an addition expert but when i saw the  tv ads this is how they came across to me and i was left thinking 'is that how you would tackle anorexia?',188
12Xpert,are you actually going to bother doing some follow up research investigating the success of this  campaign? for sure i don't expect a response to this since public dialogue doesn't seem to be in the job spec.,208
12Xpert,"i put out some analysis looking at efficiency of bfsp racing odds a few months ago and they looked pretty efficient to me.

i'd love to compare betfair exchanae to pinny i'd guess they'd be pretty close.",203
12Xpert,syrian war isn't acceptable homicide of half a million annual ins't acceptable. lot's of shit isn't acceptable. it's easy to say what you say when you don't have put tens of millions of people out of work.,205
12Xpert,the 1 .0 0 0 th best player in the world is brilliant at tennis but wont be making much of a living. you dont get paid to play tennis brilliantly. you get paid to beat others.,175
12Xpert,but probably you will counter this narrative with some more conspiracy rubbish about how that wouldn't be possible because you are controlled by post modern cultural marxism that will stop you having influence. just flat earthist garbage.,238
12Xpert,is that what you really believe? all those things i quoted have annual death rates in the hundreds of thousands or millions and presumably the victims (with the exception of most homicides) take up hospital bed spaces.,218
12Xpert,"blogabet said your tipster page was closed for spamming.
rinse and repeat means starting again and again. you have had multiple pages for record keeping some older some newer some closed (for spamming). impossible to correlate anything.",236
12Xpert,did some monte carlon on penalty shootouts. assuming team a penalty takers all have a 7 5  %  chance of conversion here the chance of them winning the shootout given the probability of team b penalty takers.,207
12Xpert,how does it matter how i'd beat a sharp book? since you and your buddy are so in love with tipsters i'd have thought you'd think it just fine for me to use them to get rich.,173
12Xpert,although i admit you would be right to charge me with whataboutism (or tu quoque argumentum) by seeking to expose the hypocrisy of not dealing with alcoholism as a reason not to do anything about gambling addiction.,215
12Xpert,i've got the data but wouldn't know how to look for any change. there's things like brier and rps but i'm not convinced they are that sophisticated or up to this job. maybe i'm wrong about that.,194
12Xpert,you mean between open and close? the formulae i use will deal with that but what's at issue is whether there's a change in how the margin is applied. i wouldn't know how to deal with that.,188
12Xpert,how do you know it's more dangerous? you may not go broke but have you run the numbers on chocolate consumption leading to diabetes or domestic violence associated with fans after a spanking by an opposing team?,211
12Xpert,similarly if the concept of losing less is more boring than the hope of winning more/easy/free for most people you then have your answer as to why people won't join you at the exchanges or at pinnacle.,201
12Xpert,a bayes factor of over 1 0 0  is typically seen as pretty solid. roughly this equates to a p-value of about 0 .0 0 1 . thats roughly in line with what n taleb argues for.,170
12Xpert,"and my intuition tells me that if you try to balance the money the market might behave erratically.
match points total line will not be linearly proportional to betshare  % . it might look something like this.",209
12Xpert,for me the concept of efficiency applies to sample somewhere between the limits of 1  game and all games. at the former there will be perfect inefficiency at the latter perfect efficiency but neither are particular informative.,227
12Xpert,this must be a really bad joke. you more than almost any other significant member of parliament wasted three years trying to ignore the will of the people so why on earth should anyone believe you now?,201
12Xpert,"after the midweek fixtures latest  2 0 1 9 /2 0  season heat map form tables. rolling four-match points totals for the league season so far.

12Xpert,indeed thats the problem. amazonian trees competing for light grow taller but still only the tallest get the most light. bettors competing for profits get more skilled on average but still only the most skilled get rewarded.,224
12Xpert,if a book is taking twice as much money on over as under based on a sharp number that's a big liability which he can do nothing about other than try to exploit it for more profit.,179
12Xpert,think about it. over/under betshare is about 6 5 :3 5 . suppose that also applies to volume. what do you think would happen if the bookmaker shifted the rewards for being correct to the same ratio?,197
12Xpert,it's easier to kill one to save five if you press a button sitting in a sealed room to push the one into the path of an incoming trolley than if you have to push them directly..,177
12Xpert,if it was true it could be a game changer. which is why it wont be true. and why  couldnt be bothered to do a serious job with this just indulge the usual upper middle class crusade.,182
12Xpert,"there you go. now the question is did the ""media"" know this and deliberately try to mislead people or were they incompetent in doing their research. either way there should be recupussions but of course there won't.",215
12Xpert,i understand what you're saying it makes sense but unless we know exactly how much has been traded and by whom and how pinny treats them all we're really just playing pin the tail on the donkey.,194
12Xpert,still waiting for the evidence there are thousands of fixed matches every week. ll you've produced so far is a story about a greek lower division. if you don't have the data shut up and go away.,194
12Xpert,the bitcoin boom and bust bubble is a better sentiment model. sentiment (greed and fear of missing out) pushed it it to  $ 2 0 0 0 0 . then it crashed by 8 5  % .,162
12Xpert,great to see the broad church diversity-favouring  party prefer the establishment-knighted white male when they had four women and one black candidate to choose from. perhaps identity politics only applies when they're 'giving it out' to others.,245
12Xpert,"yeah i get that. makes sense for some. i suppose for others with less time and a focus just on profits and less on ""winning with wits"" they might be happy to delegate this responsibility to others.",197
12Xpert,you could see if you wanted to but i didn't think that was particularly relevant to this discussion. besides as you know i always find level stakes yield (or expectation) to be the best measure of advantage.,207
12Xpert,yes i would agree. but why not exploit it even more. you yourself have argued that it's likely bookmakers take positions rather than obsess about balancing action. why not go to 4 5 -5 5  or more.,196
12Xpert,but the second half of your sentence has no relevance to the first. are there any independent measures? you can't use  results or profits. as  has said many times clv is one possible way (assuming it's valid).,209
12Xpert,"at least that's what the brenners think. 
financial speculation is different. played by the middle classes so they are already up the ladder. no need to keep them in their place. if they fuck up so what.",203
12Xpert,great traders are profitable because they have become masters at managing uncertainty. they dont win because they can see the future they win because they are certain of what they will do when faced with uncertainty.,216
12Xpert,i accept that there have been publicised cases of bookmakers encouraging those who have sought self exclusion to gamble more. but does that imply the practice is widespread and industry-wide? maybe. but let's see the evidence.,226
12Xpert,but then isn't that an admission that one can only make money in lower liquidity less efficient markets? and if so who is paying for that? certainly not the exchange it's other punters who are losing.,200
12Xpert,"easy because the recreational bookmakers know that few understand the difference only those who cry ""you ban winners."" those who understand know it's a bullshit defence of theirs but it's easy for them to deflect it.",216
12Xpert,well that is interesting. not statistically significant in my book. who is top 5  and how many sigma? what's the total number of players? what does the cumulative distribution look like? sorry for all the questions.,215
12Xpert,i've on my website i've also made this available which can help punters get a handle on the range of possible performances they can expect to exist given a set of parameters. works with level stakes.,199
12Xpert,"he's not a jew hater that's perfectly obvious. his views allow the conspiracist nonsense that the world is run by ""dark forces"" to act as a breeding ground for antisemitism and that is what has happened.",203
12Xpert,i've also shown that provided you know your average edge knowing your bet-specific edges isn't necessary and kelly still works as it's supposed to. of course you may still find it too risky; that's another story.,212
12Xpert,"there may be excessively greedy capitalists but that doesn't imply that capitalism is broken. capitalism in fact follows the old russian maxim ""trust but verify."" socialism on the other hand is more like ""distrust and dictate.""",227

12Xpert,a long read. when cryptocurrency meets ponzi a familiar story of the exploitation of cognitive bias: greed fear (of missing out) ego defence and denial (that when something is too good to be true it is),202
12Xpert,the football governing bodies have always been hypocrites when it comes to money happy to charge non profit-making fan sites thousands to show fixtures for just their club until the ecj told them this was bullshit.,214
12Xpert,"main leagues weekend fixtures available:

again no odds for the macclesfield game (away to salford in e3 ) presumably because of financial troubles.
these may appear tomorrow morning and i'll have a look (if i remember).",220
12Xpert,"because she's a person like me and you. that is the point. read the piece again. ""i hate that people are judged on who they are.""

you don't have to like what she says respect that.",181
12Xpert,what i've never actually done is looked at only genuinely cold teams i.e. scores under 0  versus genuinely hot teams scores over 0  only the relative difference so a match with two hot teams could qualify.,205
12Xpert,you'd expect a 1 0 -bet losing run once in about 9 5  bets a 1 5 -bet losing run once in about 8 2 5  bets. my article will show you how to do it.,146
12Xpert,has been analysing what we are told are the good (pro) tipsters. so far i'm not convinced that more than a small few of them even belong in that group based on what he is finding.,179
12Xpert,but he hasn't failed any doping tests nor plays for a club that breaks anti-doping rules routinely at least not to my knowledge so if we're going to talk about cheating let's talk about it properly.,198
12Xpert,"week 9  roundup here is an update to the charts. thanks to 
 for providing the data over at   will upload week 1 0  shortly and some new  coming very soon on the website with dc.js ...",184
12Xpert,so minimum stake to clear a profit is price/yield. so suppose yield after slippage was 0 .0 5  minimum stake to clear any profit would be 1 .4 5 /0 .0 5  = 2 9 .,161
12Xpert,"did i ever say liquidity was random?
and if you're suggesting it should be if performance outcomes are random why would that imply that liquidity has to be random. liquidity is not related to t/z scores.",203
12Xpert,i don't have access to punters' spending and if i asked bookmakers wouldn't give me that data. but from the presence of the favourite-longshot bias some people have inferred that punters must overbet longshots not favourites.,225
12Xpert,which rather proves that var at least in the way it has been implemented in the uk has not solved the problem it was designed to solve it has merely changed the nature of talking points.,186
12Xpert,i also like to remind people that cheating is ultimately self defeating with the cheats consuming themselves. game theory has proved this unequivocally. for social creatures engaged in competition it's much more effective to play fair.,235
12Xpert,for the uninitiated variance = luck. no one should ever underestimate how much luck there is in sports betting (good and bad). most of what happens is luck even for the small few with any skill.,194
12Xpert,methodology here by   its a pretty well tested theory. i've combined it with my strategy for lucky1 5 s to take advantages of the bonuses. it is is pretty effective strategy if you can get on.,192
12Xpert,you just gotta love the 'love' between  and  in  . mind you latter is leaving  and former is a convicted blood doper. so fairly easy to understand why morally speaking he's repeated happy to shaft him.,201
12Xpert,there are those particularly in the traditional religious sectors who would regard that as immoral. they would see it as a form of cheating on the grounds that gambling is meant to be about luck only.,200
12Xpert,assuming 2 .4  %  is your expected long term performance this is the range of things that could have happened over your 2 6 3  tips. 4 0  %  chance you could have shown a loss.,176
12Xpert,honourable aspirations but its how they are implemented. if people feel like they dont have a voice on that and are being dictated to by an elite who claim to know better then theres something wrong.,199
12Xpert,we could also debate the sanctity of nation sovereignty for for at least 5 0 0  years possibly longer the nation has been regarded as the unit of political currency for make laws doing business etc.,198
12Xpert,if you're really claiming to have had 3  losing lays in 1 7 8 7 7  where lay odds are as short as 2 /5  then you can't really expect anyone to believe this is genuine.,167
12Xpert,blackjack you have a theoretical edge if you card count but casinos will kick you out. poker is a game of psychology like sports betting and hence offers real advantage possibilities not available for casino games.,214
12Xpert,although it should be said that such a method depends on closing lines being efficient (accurate) and many don't agree with that hypothesis (although they've yet to properly show me data to prove i am wrong.),208
12Xpert,"have a read of robert axelrod's ""the evolution of cooperation"" stephen possibly the best non-fiction book i've ever read. reveals through game theory how cooperation between individuals animals in social groups is an inevitable evolutionary outcome.",249
12Xpert,i suspect the moaning is about the lack of consistency and in that respect i will be surprised if var solves it whether because different fas interpret rules differently or simply refuse to adhere to them.,205
12Xpert,don't follow. i'm merely saying that when people start complaining that the future of our country is going to be decided by a bunch of oldish white men with wealth it smacks of ageism and misandry.,197
12Xpert,live betting will likely be harder for nearly everyone to beat because of the inferior margin but for a small few there may be superior opportunities compared to pre-match because of the greater scope for inefficiency.,218
12Xpert,you're right that's why i don't do it myself. i'm restricted by most soft books and don't have the need nor motivation to earn from this. but others might hence why i put out the method.,186
12Xpert,yes on that i would probably agree with you. which is why the whistle to whistle ban on gambling ads is being introduced and the gambling commission has gone factor 5 0  on their betregret campaign.,198
12Xpert,gambling is about divining or gaining control over an unknown future. arguably the drawing of cave paintings tens of thousands of years ago was a means of story telling used to divine the prospects of hunts.,207
12Xpert,if that were true then no one would bother to turn up to a 6  nations match or champions league match or any athletics event or frankly pretty much anything beyond the level of village cricket.,193
12Xpert,i've not written an article but did post this about 1 0  days ago regarding wisdom of crowds for extra leagues. if pinnacle are not as efficient then this is probably a consequence of lower liquidity.,200
12Xpert,i have never said that it's impossible to win at a sharp bookie. i have showed the data which i maintain supports the view that very very few people can and do. show me the contrary.,182
12Xpert,playing devil's advocate with myself i should remind myself that i've written about exploiting the hot hand fallacy for systematic profit. but it's very marginal and i still remain unconvinced it will be sustainable long term.,226
12Xpert,"typical obfuscation from you richard. you just hide behind ""at our discretion."". you don't say what gets most customer restricted. you and i both know it's being a +ev player but it doesn't actually say this.",208
12Xpert,sadly this is the business model of the uk bookmaker. its their right to operate it. what i find unacceptable is their failure to make this clear in their terms and conditions and  not enforcing that.,200
12Xpert,not a hope. teams/players/managers get figured out by other teams/players/managers who then change what they do. there is simply too big a gulf from the top 6  no matter how bad arsenal and man united are.,205
12Xpert,however we could make the case that buying a position in a betting market also has added value in the form of excitement and self-confirmation or self-actualisation (when correct).   these things don't imply addiction is inevitable.,232
12Xpert,that's right. i see as many as a third profiting from their lines but that doesn't imply they made it happen. the stuff i've done tells me the proportion that make it happens is very small.,189
12Xpert,i guess the real problem is that on a case by case basis we have no idea what the true odds should be so we have no idea how accurate something else is relative to it.,167
12Xpert,so i wouldn't read too much into the 1 0 7  mdd. given the variability of the odds its entirely likely to have intra-samples where the average odds are much higher than 3 .3 4 .,177
12Xpert,you are not just competing against the bookmaker but against every other customer. and those with a slight advantage will be able to confound that. which is why there will be so few with true +ev.,196
12Xpert,"""epidemic of gambling addiction""
wasn't aware that the growth in gambling addiction is following a logarithmic trend. largely treading water according to official figures. maybe the officials are lying. did you ask them if they were?",233
12Xpert,"on the first point i didn't say it was. i said: ""one piece of evidence as being indicative of the presence or absence of skill: can you make accurate lines or odds before the bookmakers do?""",190
12Xpert,"so the implication is that you either are submitting lsbet at the bookmaker or you are changing the bookmaker after or mybigpartner are liars.

i've asked them for confirmation about this. let's see what they say.",213
12Xpert,"value betting is value betting. there is no ""different kind"" you muppet. i'm totally upfront that i can't find value at pinnacle. nor can hardly anyone else at least not in the big markets i follow.",198
12Xpert,one of the reasons i wrote the first in 2 0 0 2  was because i wanted to change that. i had hoped that i had in part. maybe this poll will help provide an answer.,162
12Xpert,not exactly. teams that win have odds that on average shorten. teams that lose have odds that on average lengthen. i think rich tax evader is saying that's because teams that win tend to be favourites.,201
12Xpert,this is the problem of identity politics whether on grounds of sex race faith politics class wealth education and so on. highlighting difference to defend one's own traits is the slippery slope to hatred and worse.,214
12Xpert,real people dont care for ideology they just want a better life and will vote for the person who looks most credible to deliver it. real socialism has never been credible precisely because it is ideological.,207
12Xpert,suits ireland too until the eu decide to get tough on them on their tax haven status for multinationals at which point it dawns on the electorate they they won't even get a say on anything.,189
12Xpert,regardless i guess it does mean that my methods to remove the vig are too simple since it would appear the may treat the draw a bit differently which to be honest i'd always suspected anyway.,191
12Xpert,whatever that says about market efficiency at least it proves that the  market knows how to find winners since their prices shorten whilst prices for the losers lengthen and it's completely impossible this happens by chance.,224
12Xpert,yes 1 :1  on average. obviously impossible individually since it's it's impossible to know the 'true' line in anything other than a quantum mechanical sense. the sub samples however are fairly discrete 0 .5  point resolution.,225
12Xpert,on the second point the model assumed that the biggest stakers were the sharp bettors. so the lower the proportion of sharp bettors the more whales there will be. that's just how i designed the staking.,202
12Xpert,"indeed my thought process was going in a very similar direction. 
it's a bit like vat. only the end user pays financially which effectively is the public who don't trade enough to have a vat number.",198
12Xpert,it's slowly becoming apparent that the discount rate we've been applying might be too great. that's probably a consequence of short term electoral cycles and the buy now pay later culture that seems to be ubiquitous.,216
12Xpert,the point is how do they use that information. if 9 5  %  of customers are betting over then they can't be using too much of the information that this money is bringing to the market.,183
12Xpert,it is if clvh is correct. i think if you are suggesting that clvh does not apply to your sample you have to come up with a new hypothesis for why test it and prove it.,167
12Xpert,you might be like  and have a soothsayer-like ability to find lines that the bookmaker is intentionally biasing. but unless we have another set of reference data to test that we can't prove anything either way.,210
12Xpert,"absurd that most punters fail to make money even when handing them a +ev opportunity on a silver plate!

here is why

the single biggest mistake punters make



same illogical pattern is true for my services",207
12Xpert,with regards the  newspaper which has been at the forefront of the anti-gambling campaign their level of hypocrisy by featuring adverts from the very same betting companies they call out is frankly astonishing. pots and kettles.,228
12Xpert,just with regards exchanges betfair say that less than 0 .5  %  of their customers are on premium charge. i imagine that's a fairly reliable figure that correlates with the percentage of long term expected winners.,214
12Xpert,"""returns are artificially high because the market is growing""
that's how a ponzi works even if was not intended to be one.

""but when it stops it will become zero sum.""
when ponzis stop they crash.",197
12Xpert,alcohol is drunk by middle classes and intelligentsia disproportionately more than working and 'underclass'. they're hardly going to fuck themselves over. gambling is done by stupid poor people who need looking after by the first lot.,234
12Xpert,at the very least why is it wrong to ask the question and consider the option? why the automatic assumption it's terrible and there's nothing to discuss and anyone who defends it is a bad person?,195
12Xpert,perhaps so. but can you tell me what's bad about such a link. i guess i'm really asking why it is that society forever has seen gambling (as it is understood) to be a deviant behaviour.,185
12Xpert,in an idealised market where all players are exposed to each other then i would assume that is what would happen in the end. perhaps my modelling and understand of relative-skills markets is not good enough.,207
12Xpert,or that they are aware but their disposition is to generalise towards the moral position that pareto in society is bad  thereby conflating the two issues. would that be intentional or unintended? i have no idea.,211
12Xpert,unless you happen to be thinking and modelling like the bookmaker and happen to be targeting lines that the bookmaker is intentionally taking positions on. then clv may not give an accurate measure of ev.,204
12Xpert,but this is the problem. over very large samples efficiency is essentially an obvious truism. but that doesn't rule out inefficiencies at smaller scales that some bettor are smart enough to find understand and exploit.,218
12Xpert,the smaller we make those samples the more likely it is that something will look inefficient. the bigger we make them the more likely it is we are simply stating an obvious but meaningless truism.,196
12Xpert,fabulous work. the slope is less than 1  so does that imply pinny's odds do not contain all the relevant information and some is to be found in the other bookmakers? (i.e. not perfectly efficient),196

12Xpert,this buys into the cultural stereotype that gambling is bad. we miss out on such a huge opportunity to teach children about risk uncertainty probability skin in the game which are valuable lessons for life.,206
12Xpert,interestingly every team below the top 6  as ranked by average and max with the exception of everton have been relegated at some point. this would seem to indicate that everton's time may be due.,195

12Xpert,i don't know what the yellow line actually is. it looks far to erratic to be expected profit based on closing line value. but perhaps it is. just hoping nish can confirm what it is.,181
12Xpert,yes that's right at this scale. like i showed with the anchor bias articles there can be inefficiency in a sample of prices which disappears when those samples are aggregated with a poorer odds resolution.,205
12Xpert,so in addition to my level stakes yield calculator i've now built a percentage stakes bankroll growth calculator to show the distribution of possibilities for particular betting scenarios. with percentage staking returns are log-normally distributed.,250

12Xpert,i changed my data source so don't have those easily available. i would always urge people to run their own woc analysis if they are following this method anyway since pinny odds may have changed.,195
12Xpert,"just how bad are manchester united? 

our analyst uses expected goals to take a close look at  season so far 

- attacking problems 
- the players 
- defensive process 
- how does the season end?",195
12Xpert,it's hard to say without the specific prices but at a guess the fair price would be around 2 2 0  so 2 8 0  would hold an expected value of 2 7  % .,148
12Xpert,these are tips at a sharp bookmaker not some tinpot recreational like unibet who ban you for exploiting generous odds compilers. are you able to return a sustainable profit from pinnacle over thousands of bets?,210
12Xpert,"premier league week six roundup -  write-up is coming very soon. big thanks as always to 

 for providing the data. i am using 

 prices. i will be doing some more  soon if anyone is interested?",194
12Xpert,which all reminded me of a talk i saw at the bluedot festival in july entitled polar thinking. if people learnt to think like dr tamsin edwards  society would make better progress solving these problems.,203
12Xpert,it worked for me although not as reliable as football from memory. perhaps this was because this was based on atp/wta data only no challengers or futures as was the case for miguel's data set,191
12Xpert,what the hell is the matter with some people where they are so f.....g obsessed about being right about a divisive issue shrouded in uncertainties that they shut down debate over the simplest of questions.,205
12Xpert,whatever it is the earth won't end life won't end humans will adapt (they are good at that) and doomsdayers and deniers in equal measure will still continue to spout shite they know little about.,195
12Xpert,on the contrary i think almost any judgement that involves prediction the future with money at stakes (sports betting and financial markets in particular) is only a coin flip for nearly everyone who does it.,207
12Xpert,"welcome to the pinnacle of the future

 easy to use with intuitive navigation and a modern look-and-feel

 faster than ever to find your favourite markets

 consistent experience across desktop and mobile

 personalise your betting experience",242
12Xpert,wrecked by people who had no real stake in anything at all because they will always be comfortable. like the 2 0 0 8  financial crisis. capitalism for the profits and socialism for the losses.,192
12Xpert,indeed there are gamblers to gamble in excess and losers who lose more than they can afford. but they are not stupid in the same way that anyone with any other mental illness isn't stupid.,188
12Xpert,actually for favourites 1 0  points magnitude it was enough in this sample. whether it's genuinely statistically significant and therefore persistent going into the future or simple a lucky set of data is another matter.,220
12Xpert,why might bookmakers intentionally bias a point spread market? i've attempted to formalise my thinking with this article (part 1 ) and pay deference to  who endlessly challenges my view that markets must be efficient.,217
12Xpert,"oh i don't doubt that for a minute. 
academic papers aside if overconfidence is so widespread in human behaviour we have to come up with an explanation for why it exists and hasn't died out.",190
12Xpert,if you haven't read the logic of sports betting yet i'd strongly suggest doing so.  and  have written one of the best betting books out there. if you still need convincing read my book review.,192
12Xpert,"the  is very much against the normalisation of gambling in society. it doesn't take much to find examples of their journalism against it; ""gambling is always dangerous"" for example. the labour party is joining them.",215
12Xpert,and the argument that the people aren't clever enough to deal with such topics is offensive. teach them then. is it any harder than determining whether scotland would be economically better off outside the uk?,209
12Xpert,closing 1  times 2  is already there for pinny. opening is more of a challenge for me but if you need them for analysis purposes  have large historical opening odds data sets free of charge.,190
12Xpert,good for you. so then all you need to do is to get enough people to agree with you that you are right and then you get what you want. it's how this thing works.,160
12Xpert,much as i admire djokovics talent as a player he lets himself down with his gamesmanship in an attempt to disrupt his opponent when playing poorly. neither nadal nor federer made any complaints about conditions.,211
12Xpert,if the code says gambling shouldn't be linked to enhanced sexual attractiveness the you shouldn't be promoting your brand with deals who are obviously attractively above average.  simply don't use images of people at all.,221
12Xpert,you shouldn't have to. they should tell you what you have done and given that for nearly all it will be because they beat the starting price that should be in their terms and conditions.,186
12Xpert,so again implied 5 3 8  odds divided by implied true odds estimated from pinnacle opening odds is a decent measure of expected roi (on average). sample size is 4 9 9 0 5  odds.,176
12Xpert,midweek main leagues and extra leagues results have been added. weekend fixtures for all will be available later earlier than normal since i will be unable to deliver them at the usual time on friday.,200
12Xpert,i still intend to get to work on the analysis with opening pinny and bet3 6 5  odds again it's still probably oranges and lemons but will be interesting to see if there's any difference.,186
12Xpert,what d'ya mean not planned it. everything has a plan. there's design in everything. everything happens for a reason. no such think as chance. just insufficient data. i expect to get rich quick with this.,203
12Xpert,and frankly i think it says all these sports forecasting groups are utterly pointless and self serving (which is probably what taleb would say of nate) since a sharp betting market does a better job.,199
12Xpert,ok it's a methodology soccer system which is similar with elo systemu can check it via this linksince ima rookie at soccer gambling im not sure the content make sense or notso i ask you,185
12Xpert,then add in the fact that no one knows what 'true' prices really are and you have a very nuanced picture of what efficiency actually means. it's like will-o'-the-wisp it's just impossible to pin down.,200
12Xpert,"all the more reason to drop the ones they don't like then if there's no difference in revenue.

perhaps boris should use that line next time he takes stick over arms sales to the saudis.",186
12Xpert,it's clear what was deemed significant: the encouragement and irresponsible enticement to see gambling as a means of earning a living. provided tipsters disclaim that their advice does not guarantee profits then there's no problem.,231
12Xpert,im insanely stubborn with people who have no content to their criticism just ad hominem bs. give me a new hypothesis and data to prove it and ill give you all the time you want.,177
12Xpert,if you dont agree with this truth then disprove it. if you dont like me talking about this truth and wont disprove it then too bad. im not here to wrap you in cotton wool.,171
12Xpert,"so when they then say to me ""that's not my job"" you will surely understand why i will then say ""in that case just fuck off will you if you have nothing constructive to offer.""",175
12Xpert,just overconfident tipsters completely blind to their inabilities fooled by randomness and in denial. time and tie and time again. so many times. nothing i've from you leads me to conclude i'm seeing anything different.,219
12Xpert,value is value. staking is another matter. what are you stake limits on table tennis at a recreational bulgarian bookmaker. how long do you get to keep your account open with +1 5  %  ev?,187
12Xpert,you can answer this question with something like this. but all i get from you and your buddy when i do stuff like this is insults that i live in theory and not in reality.,171
12Xpert,nah it won't have changed much. psychological biases are deep rooted. like the muller-lyer visual illusion. doesn't matter how may times you tell yourself the horizontal lines are the same length they never look it.,215
12Xpert,i see yet again that  has been misunderstood by the identity-obsessed scientifically-misinformed twitterati who exist to be offended.. at least that's my interpretation. but perhaps that's because i'm a 1 st world middle-aged white man.,236
12Xpert,on the flip side doesn't that suggest prohibition is a complete failure and legalisation does not lead to elevated rates of addiction and societal breakdown? (something to think about for the gambling prohibitionists and paternalists.),235
12Xpert,following on from yesterday with a request from  here's the breakdown of average o/c ratios for wins and losses categorised by win probability (as implied by opening  odds). not sure if the trends are significant.,213
12Xpert,it's the 'taking assets off people via skill' that is the bit that is considered immoral. it's just a moral position that is easily dubunkable but nonetheless people still have the right to hold it.,198
12Xpert,basically averages even small averages can look efficient but this may be masking smaller scale inefficiencies associated with a greater number of variables which if you are clever and avoid model over-fitting could be exploitable.,231
12Xpert,indeed isn't that the point? overconfidence. without that betting would largely stop. a buyer and a seller both think they are right otherwise the transaction wouldn't take place. one of them has to be wrong.,208
12Xpert,you don't think diabetes wrecks people lives? you don't think anorexia wrecks people lives yet the entire fashion industry is built on advertising size zero. addiction is tragic but you don't solve it via prohibition.,217
12Xpert,opening lines. it's not surprising. opening odds are almost as efficient as closing odds according to this measure and at this resolution. the problem is we can't see the inefficiencies looking at things like this.,214
12Xpert,i wrote up this idea as a two-part article. here's part 2  which looks at anchoring. you might need to read part 1  to make sense of the model assuming you haven't seen these already.,183
12Xpert,yes i agree this is the joint hypothesis problem and presents a fundamental difficulty for emh testing and why some say emh is all bs. in such cases i tend resort to duck resemblance philosophy.,194
12Xpert,as per my answer to your first tweet yes you could but the average user is probably not going to be bothered by the extra work assuming they follow the rationale in the first place.,181
12Xpert,but it's not entirely clear whether the book is prepared to face the liability of doing so. as with any form of gambling or speculating you have to take more risk to get more profit.,182
12Xpert,the recreational model is easier to operate than the sharp book model in a high regulation high tax regime. and it's legal (even if you think it's immoral) that's all there is too it really.,190
12Xpert,media reports today that betting companies have had access to the learning records service database are untrue. gb group provides age-verification services to a range of organisations from banks to government agencies and betting companies.,240
12Xpert,again that's just a sweeping generalisation to confirm with a stereotype driven by people's pre-existing belief systems. some on course bookmakers work really hard and take big risks to try to make their livelihood work.,220
12Xpert,i.e. if players don't fully appreciate that their current success may largely be down to exponential growth in market volume they will falsely conclude that it's all down to their skill to predict price movements.,213
12Xpert,that's not a proper experiment. how do you know the bookmaker hadn't already marked you as sharp and whether they would respond in the same way to those customers they have decided are not sharp.,195
12Xpert,so long as there is this exponentially growing interest in fi it will do well. but if it's just built on this kind of sentiment it will be hit in the same in the end.,166
12Xpert,you can be profitable with any odds provided you have expected value. the only thing to consider is that with odds of 1 .2 0  the best yield you can achieve is 2 0  % ,167
12Xpert,in the end fees and slippage are going to destroy most profits for most customers. perhaps not as much in racing where there is bigger variance but then all the sportsbooks ban racing winners anyway.,199
12Xpert,yeah you could but to use my calculator for the final p-value bit you'd still need to standardise the stakes so that the average was 1  unit for the purposes of getting the standard deviation.,192
12Xpert,finally it's perfectly reasonably to defend an industry without personally profiting from it. i would legalise most recreational drugs even though i don't use them and don't and would never want to profit from them.,215
12Xpert,no sure anyone has said 'only place'. of course no one can defend it against the absolutist anti gambling moral outrage. but i don't think that position is really very sensible or useful for society.,199
12Xpert,yes but my point is that the biases are small because if they become too obvious they get exploited away. f-l is an obvious example: not quite big enough to make a profit after costs.,183
12Xpert,"this is just a semantic disagreement. just place the onus on the bookmaker to have to say something (by law) and they will find their own set of words to explain what ""winner"" means",181
12Xpert,can you do similar but instead use g/xg rather than g-xg or preferably natural log(g/xg). can you also calculate the standard deviation and then let me know how far messi is from the mean.,188
12Xpert,i'd still expect the largest profits to be coming from the 2  %  commission because these account for circa 8 0  %  of bets and probably in excess of 9 5  %  of volume.,168
12Xpert,i suppose you need to know about how to translate odds into probability and other things like margin and favourite-longshot bias so it's easy for the uninitiated simply to listen to opta et al.,193
12Xpert,analytics companies presumably make these forecasts for fun and entertainment. however for customers of this entertainment it still begs the question why don't they just look at a bookmaker's odds for a better prediction?,221
12Xpert,final observation from today's thread and the various responses it has attracted: lots of men still use the fortunes of their football team to measure the size of their penis (sorry i mean ego).,194
12Xpert,this is exactly what happens in the favourite-longshot bias. bookmakers can lengthen favourites knowing that punters will still back the longshots but ensuring that the favourites are still not quite offering value (on average).,228
12Xpert,"bet on cold when cold is -1  and hot is +0 .5

bets= 2 4 6 3
yield = 6 .4 7  % 
avg odds = 4 .2 6
p-value = 0 .0 4",114
12Xpert,"more mugs playing means potential more ev for you.

but to be clear it isn't 5 0 -5 0 . 

what's random is initial orientation angle and manner in which the coin is flipped.",173
12Xpert,sorry no plans. with basic shots data i don't think my xg data would be as good as others provide. don't know of an excel source for xg but maybe someone here will know.,169
12Xpert,sacrifice may have been a means of securing favour (the prize) from the gods about an uncertain future. its not a stretch to see this evolve into more complex attempts to preordain the future.,192
12Xpert,yes you're probably right but by its nature a model has to be reductionist. how would you model emotional intelligence. presumably that would be a lot trickier. i agree talent is a vague concept.,195
12Xpert,liquidity has nothing to do with proving whether betting performances are nearly random or otherwise. we are talking about risk-adjusted deviations from expectation (the bookmaker's margin) for example via t scores or z scores.,227
12Xpert,it might be but sadly i don't have penalties data. far fewer reds so how reliable would it be. anecdotally i don't feel i see a bias when i'm collecting the red card data.,171
12Xpert,if you want workers rights vote for a uk political party who will win the argument about them. if they don't win the argument you and they will have to try harder next time.,173
12Xpert,every now and again you come across a story thats worth telling but for sure its so depressing that so many athletes and trainers show complete disregard for the people that matter: the fans.,191
12Xpert,a nike ambassador and husband to mo farahs coach the one he had after salazar the convicted dope cheat and bbc failed to declare the obvious conflict of interest prior to the interview. brilliant.,196
12Xpert,xg data is produced by a model using raw data like shots. i just provide the raw data. you are welcome to develop an xg model using the available data to build xg stats.,169
12Xpert,however they see chance as the arbiter of outcomes as immoral too preferring instead to invoke diving providence e.g. the drawing of lots. i suppose you could respond by saying god helped me win.,195
12Xpert,nice work. a little bit of favourite-longshot bias on display there. i will have more to say on this in my next  article which will hopefully be published before the end of the week.,182
12Xpert,and good call on today's stage. for the final climb you must have honestly believed it was a done deal until the last 5 0 0 m. was there an opportunity to cash out?,164
12Xpert,and a good thing it could which probably prevented the other 3  bad things happening and is why countries like greece spain italy and france suffer. they have to devalue people rather than money.,195
12Xpert,here are the charts for unemployment and wages. where do we begin? clearly the people responsible for publishing these charts either had not the slightest comprehension of uncertainty (clueless) or were politically motivated (charlatan).,237
12Xpert,then he would know that single results or small profits from 1 9 4  bets in a mostly random environments prove nothing at all. in which case why say its only profit that matters?,178
12Xpert,belonging to the eu might be good for other things like labour rights health and safety and standards and quality of goods but you didn't promote that argument. yours was about trade and tariffs.,195
12Xpert,as for persistence it's almost non existent. so i say again prove to me that there is more than a tiny percent of sharp book tipsters who are genuinely skilled. show me the data.,178
12Xpert,the method is fully described here. you will have your betting accounts restricted by those brands that you can use to make this work. that is a problem i leave to users to solve.,179
12Xpert,"""technology cant pick up subjective elements like the weather or player injuries which affect play whether before or during a match.""
which is essentially why  versus  was never going to be a real contest.",205
12Xpert,it's fine. it's human. being human is all we can be. perhaps all of us should just spend a bit more time stepping outside of ourselves to recognise this and recognising it in others.,182
12Xpert,this is a very basic method of how to develop and test a betting system. don't assume it's profitable anymore i'm showing it to you purely to give you an idea of what's involved.,178
12Xpert,1 -0   (via  liverpool have had more of the ball in the final third and completed more passes in the box... not the worst half camp nou will have seen from a visiting side.,172
12Xpert,however i'm glad you believe in complete transparency many don't or make excuses for not bothering. but that also means not deleting records when they become unprofitable and starting again under a new name.,207
12Xpert,one team can feel hard done by but then who's going to feel sorry for teams where money is no object financial fair play rules are ignored and dope testing is considered an annoyance.,183
12Xpert,i only have opening odds back to 7 th july 2 0 1 7  so i'd be missing most of the sample. i'd only have about 2 5 0 0  matches to go off.,137
12Xpert,if the typically reported daily case increase rate of 3 3  %  is correct you would expect to reach 1 3  million cases in about 2  months which is roughly the observed time scale.,178
12Xpert,it's the random part that voids the whole +ev idea. the mechanics of a coin toss make it roughly a 5 1 /4 9  proposition but randomness in the starting conditions make this irrelevant.,184
12Xpert,which then changes the perspective on mortality rates. obviously its still going to be a huge impact on public health services but the currently quoted mortality rates are mistakenly fuelling hysteria that isnt helpful.,219
12Xpert,how is it an oversight when i've pointed this out to them numerous time over many months. let's be clear they like having the advertising revenue and betting companies pay handsomely in that respect.,199
12Xpert,well this depends on what were talking about. if we mean the playing of tennis then thats a high validity environment since purposeful practice and feedback from errors allows for learning and skill acquisition.,211
12Xpert,for sure that was more honourable because in effect it was offering to redund not just subs but betting losses too. if a tipster genuinely had faith over variance they would routinely offer this.,195
12Xpert,i guess we would limit this to nba nhl nfl mlb and top league european soccer. track the pinnacle bet limits too both at bet time and at closing. then we'd get an answer.,170
12Xpert,but remain-voters are on the whole less tolerant of people who don't agree with them. presumably that's because they consider themselves to be morally and/or intellectually superior whilst confusing facts with probabilities (and opinions).,239
12Xpert,on average not even close. the biggest average move is for the away wins which is 1 .2 5  %  but i'd guess the effective margin for these prices is around 4  % .,161
12Xpert,"if only we could ""see"" underlying probabilities in the same way we can see points in things like nba. then you would know what change in probability equates to the size of the margin.",183
12Xpert,on the first point i did test it model with a bias essentially akin to lovett's 4 8 -5 2  favourites bias. this is what i said at the end of the second part.,157
12Xpert,and attempt has been made by the gambling commission to argue that vips are 1 1  times more likely than non vips to be problem gamblers which has been widely reported in the media.,180
12Xpert,i already suggested you kidnap the ceo. when you have him you can get him to say whether his traders are biasing the lines that you're tipping on. then we will know for sure.,174
12Xpert,anyway don't take my word for it. i believe most well known pro bettors have said or would say that finding a decent profitably clv edge has got tougher and tougher over the years.,180
12Xpert,i'd have to be interested in it. i'm not. if someone gave me a free play station i'd just give it away. i apologise to you in advance for being such a boring bastard.,166
12Xpert,actually don't. i'd like to learn more about fi so this conversation is useful. you can always mute it if you don't want to be part of it and take your sarcastic wit elsewhere.,176
12Xpert,of course there are always exceptions but then i guess you have to be lucky (or hard working enough) to find them. black cats don't show up easily against a background of black coal.,182
12Xpert,"how do you know they are fixed? are you fixing them?

in fact in the real world of evidence-based information it's believed about 1  %  of matches might have been influenced in some way.",186
12Xpert,insurance companies are possibly the biggest thieves in the risk management industry; their vig is immeasurably bigger than a bookmaker's. they exploit our bias towards the possibility effect. how can you possibly defend them?,226
12Xpert,there are ways and there are ways of reducing gambling addiction. simply stopping people gambling legally may not be the way? and simply stopping people gambling full stop may push that addiction somewhere else.,211
12Xpert,i like think i'm trying to be in the business of looking for solutions to problems. i'm not at all convinced that getting angry at gambling companies will lower the incidence of gambling addiction.,197

12Xpert,well it's that 9 9 .9  %  figure that's open to debate. broadly speaking i agree with you but we don't actually know what it is and how it varies for different markets.,168
12Xpert,i think we already knew that football analytics companies are not as good as bookmakers at probability forecasts. they don't need to be because they don't have skin in the game like bookmakers.,193

12Xpert,i would suggest you learn some statistical testing techniques. t-test can be used to test the difference between two averages provided the data or at least sub-samples of that data are normally distributed.,206
12Xpert,brilliant. destroy a billion pound industry that supports 8 5 0 0 0  jobs because you have a moral objection to gambling at least you've finally been honest about your view of it.,179
12Xpert,that would depend on how many bets they are having in that time. i agree profits are an indicator but only if you study what everyone else achieves doing the same as you.,170
12Xpert,yes boring. you're obviously missing the point of survivorship bias. only those will the best records get selected to the premium version. but being the best does not imply being the most skilled.,196

12Xpert,i don't doubt that. as with tipsters though most are blind to their own absence of skill and when a forecast comes good they erroneously believe they had something to do with it.,178
12Xpert,if as a society we are going to allow gambling identifying and interacting with those with a problem is the only viable option. driving the problem underground or offshore is not a solution.,190
12Xpert,"cheaters die out with their own cheating. the puzzling part is that it was the russians who first coined the phrase ""trust but verify."" sadly putin's version no longer adheres to that maxim.",190
12Xpert,"were you aware that  closed their programme to ""all"" affiliates with one month's notice a couple of years back destroying years of had work under the pretence that they cared about problem gambling?",198
12Xpert,i've proved that beyond doubt. what have you proved? nothing. and lets not forget that coin tossing or otherwise you still need industry loses to pay for you. bets don't happen without them.,190
12Xpert,"even if that means tossing coins for them? that makes you as sinful as me then don't it?
""i'm not tossing coins.""
oh really then prove it.
""look at my profit dumb ass!"".",169
12Xpert,but my point still stands. if others do as you you all cancel out. the question is really whether it's harder with in-play hence gives more opportunities for clever and/or hard working people.,192
12Xpert,for sure if they can sell subscriptions to customers who can use them. thats certainly the way i would do it assuming i had any pinnacle +ev to sell in the first place,167
12Xpert,im not sure id call it forcing. the wording requires the reader to think about sample and the fact that they are part of it to avoid the possibility of committing the fallacy.,175
12Xpert,to conclude i still don't see strong evidence for systematic profitability being available beyond the costs of playing simply by exploiting squares' cognitive biases. people are stupid but not that stupid. on average.,217
12Xpert,"on the tv all the time; deliberately appealing to young males with a laddish disposition; throwing in the the word ""everybody"" to avoid accusations of sexism encouraging acca betting which increases their margin.",212
12Xpert,i would need to see hundreds of sharp bettors like you showing the same pattern and knowing that they bet directly via pinnacle and not via a broker before i would be convinced.,177
12Xpert,take it as an important lesson. if you have 2 0 0  bets a year then you'll never find out if you're really any good. but it's up to you what you do.,148
12Xpert,"sure the way to ""[provoke] self-appraisal and self-reflection"" is not via making fun and making people feel small and stupid. but as i said i'm no expert on this genuinely interested to learn.",192
12Xpert,"i think you are confusing ""pro gamblers"" with ""pinnacle bettors"". there will be very little overlap. almost no bettors are pros.  and almost none of them are profitable through skill. take a look.",196
12Xpert,is probably right. some of it will be weight of money some of it will be bookmakers exploiting squares and some of it will be bookmakers attracting new customers. the picture is nuanced.,186
12Xpert,i think that's a fair compromise. set up a profit at  and tip the draws in real time. a couple of thousand tips should be sufficient should take about a year i guess.,166
12Xpert,that is indeed the question. for the sample in the article the most likely explanation is chance (p-value = 0 .1 2 ) but a longer record may change this. time will tell.,169
12Xpert,we are talking about roulette. ill set you a challenge. well play a billion wheel spins on red-black with a single zero wheel and you try to lose more than me with skill,169

12Xpert,i can absolutely assure you that pro bettors will insist on evidence.  will tell you all about clv evidence. without it you have no idea when you'll default on your next mortgage payment.,187
12Xpert,it only really matters if you know what your advantage is per bet. but who does? hence we take an average and the best way to compute that average is with level stakes.,168
12Xpert,yeah i think that's it. less action fewer bettors so if you get it wrong you have less chance to put it right with additional volume. hence reduce risk by lowering stake limit.,176
12Xpert,in fact as education levels increase the variance between punter ability arguably decreases meaning outcomes of contest become more a subject of luck (gambling). this is the paradox of skill beautifully described by,215
12Xpert,i've done it with data analysis. i've showed that thousands of pinnacle tipsters (people who believe themselves to be good enough to sell tips) distribute almost exactly the same as coin tosses would.,200

 for providing the data over at   (re-uploaded as the video had issues before and wasn't showing)",172
12Xpert,"unfortunately the words ""survivorship bias"" appear nowhere in this article. until you learn what this is and take it into account this is my advice: don't ever pay anyone for tips.",180
12Xpert,"when i use the word ""efficiency"" in a  betting context  describes perfectly what i (think i) mean. drill down into his thread and the posts that prompted it for more context.",174
12Xpert,"and as for brexit people would do well to remember the complexity of these systems before adopting absolutists positions with words like ""denier"" over matters that are fundamentally probabilistic in nature.",206
12Xpert,fully efficient would mean closing prices reflect true prices and the amount you beat them by accurately predicts your returns. the chart hear shows thats not case for this tennis sample,186
12Xpert,i don't care if he's f....g paul erds reincarnated he clearly hasn't got a clue and is potentially deceiving followers by giving the impression via results and profits that he does.,181
12Xpert,you will be welcome in my debating cafe where there are only two rules: no abuse and debaters have to adopt a position they would normally oppose vehemently and defend it.,171
12Xpert,well i don't want your world to end so let's see. it's really not much extra both to include them. just anted to make sure they were still wanted by people.,156
12Xpert,"that old chestnut again so you have a hot line to ""moral truth"" now do you? did you complain in 2 0 0 7  about this? or was it right then?",138
12Xpert,that will depend on what the market is. for large markets i would expect them to be very similar but i don't have the data to allow me to test this.,148
12Xpert,thats not actually correct. the figure for effectively going bust was 2 8  % . but for sure the take home message of the research still applies and is highly important.,168
12Xpert,in effect he identifying the same profitably contrarian positions that pinny identifies. if pinny offered him a job as a trader that would certainly then shift my prior belief in clvh,183
12Xpert,if you could have had fair odds (2 .0 0 ) for these spreads then this is how your bankroll would have evolved. evidently there is a bias of some kind.,150
12Xpert,as said before if it was so easy to exploit shading everyone would cotton on. i would believe that most sharp profitability comes from the much harder work of spotting errors.,175
12Xpert,the fact that a lot of people lose more than the vig does not imply that others fading them will win enough to cover it. i think that is rufus' point.,150
12Xpert,sells a good story with his open acknowledgement the problem gambling is an important issue but as always the devil is in the detail. judge a bookmaker by actions not words.,173
12Xpert,i'm afraid i have to disappoint you and say i have no idea. perhaps  might be able to help i believe his has been doing a bit of machine learning lately.,153
12Xpert,thanks but i rather suspect that if no one else at  is the slightest bit interested at resolving this i doubt they would either. but i will give it a go.,153
12Xpert,there's a thought. no i don't. i used to lecture university courses on climate through earth history and atmospheric science but that was 2 0  years ago in a different life.,173
12Xpert,this is what is called regression to the mean. most important lesson a punter should learn short of knowing not to chase losses and burning money they can't afford to lose.,172
12Xpert,ok so picking the number 1 .5  %  out of thin air is far more reliable. just clearing it up in my mind. is that how you find expected value too?,144
12Xpert,here's the list. betway is a possible implosion waiting to happen following the 1 1 .6 m gambling commission fine. if it was my money i know what i'd be doing.,159
12Xpert,"extra leagues: mexico poland and russia still playing this weekend. presumably subject to change in this most fluid of times.

for the main league all english fixtures have gone. update later.",192
12Xpert,he has control over writing it obviously not publishing it. as i said if they refused to publish it that might tell him they aren't completely on board with his philosophy.,172
12Xpert,ok so what causes the most impact to public services? the virus or the panic response to the virus? presumably toilet paper in uk supermakets didn't get cleared by the virus.,174
12Xpert,"or you could simplify the two and get this.

punter's expected return = product of all the odds divided by the sum of all the odds.

try it. it will work.",154
12Xpert,so what?  how many tips? what odds? how many thousands (probably tens of thousands of tipsters) have tried on pyckio from which you're choosing these? you never provide the full picture.,186
12Xpert,how do you know that remain voters weren't just as easily (mis)led by economic projections which thus far have proved to be way outside even the 9 5  %  confidence intervals?,174
12Xpert,would anyone be able to walk me through a worked example of calculating the rank probability score for a football match using the bookies odds for the implied forecast home/draw/away probabilities.,197
12Xpert,"what was your question? also if i won then i assume that means shading is typically not beyond the margin right?
i know i'm being lazy i'll listen to it later.",159
12Xpert,or to put it another way it might seem a bit hypocritical to get moral about bookmakers when the whole business of betting could arguably be described as a moral-free environment.,179
12Xpert,alternatively if you are right isn't that further support that there are almost no truly sharp bettors since a book would not be able to afford more than a small number.,169
12Xpert,but it doesn't matter about one event. there will always be outcome noise about true probabilities. that is what is aleatory uncertainty. that's relationships between expected and actual look like this.,202
12Xpert,very interesting thread. the bias seems a maximum at 6 0 /4 0 . but then why are those players still winning 6 0 /4 0  as your final plot implies?,146
12Xpert,"maybe i'm talking to one.

it's uncanny how you manage just to change the nature of the tipster population from which we're selecting simply on a whim to suit your position.",173
12Xpert,in the time it has taken me to write a book review  is close to publishing another book! hope it was worth the wait the book is definitely worth a read.,152
12Xpert,yes i agree. but that is still consistent with saying that the average bettor today would be better at predicting the correct line than the average bettor 2 5  years ago.,170
12Xpert,i'm sure that's true. but there must be cases as here (superbowl) where they just don't get a choice. if they responded to 9 5 /5  the line would go nuts.,154
12Xpert,i'm afraid i don't keep any of the pre-closing odds for those extra leagues.  have opening and closing prices for these and many more but you have to pay a fee.,160
12Xpert,"no sorry.
 have some of what you want but for a fee.
failing that there is oddsportal but youll have to do the work getting it into your preferred file format.",159
12Xpert,that would imply that the bias which the shading is exploiting is random and not systematic which arguably it isn't e.g. overs spread favourites f-l. biases by definition must be systematic,189
12Xpert,indirectly you facilitate more reckless gambling by gambling yourself. you offer action for reckless people to bet against. it is the indirect nature of it that allows you to justify it.,186
12Xpert,i'm happy to leave you lot alone and have fun making money so i don't need any more alpha males bringing me back into this debate. i thought we were done.,154
12Xpert,time will tell. if you make money from it good for you. if it turns out to be built on sand it will be the late arrivals who pay the price.,139
12Xpert,i find it all very puzzling. the victorians were appalled by sexual desire but happy to trade opium. people bandy this moral positions about as if they are absolutes. they're aren't.,182
12Xpert,i'm not talking about luck. lots of players are profitable. for histories up to 1 0 0 0  bets about a quarter to a third will be. i'm talking about expectation.,160
12Xpert,"the concept of (in)efficiency is more useful as description model depending on your sample size than it is a statement of truth (or otherwise).

maybe i'm just stating the obvious here.",185
12Xpert,how do you set about distinguishing market evolution from mean regression? or is referring to the latter just a fancy way of saving face when your strategy goes tits up?,169
12Xpert,we take f-l into account when calculating clv. even if the bias has been changing and my model for accounting for it is wrong this will have very limited influence.,164
12Xpert,that's a good question but from the recreational bookmaker's perspective it makes little difference because it's still likely the second kind of player will be exploiting the best market prices.,194
12Xpert,i have a far more effective tool for setting limits: my woc method. follow it without efforts to disguise your activity and you will have all your bookmaker accounts closed.,173
12Xpert,lots of players will outperform xg the question is whether that is luck or something else. that's why i'm interested in seeing the distribution and who are in the tails.,169
12Xpert,yes. i'll say again. if the press don't agree with him in this country they are free to say so. stop believing his message was right and the press wrong.,153
12Xpert,new     predictions for 2 0 1 9 -2 0  (method at  including fixture difficulty and more). attack strength  defence weakness ratings shown by team. the model still loves  data by,177

12Xpert,new  predictions for 2 0 1 9 -2 0  (method:  ) after the weekend games. attack strength  defence weakness ratings shown by team.  second favourites for the title! data by,170
12Xpert,i agree with the spending plans (apart from the silly stuff about renationalisation). it's how you credibly pay for it without massive increasing national debt and wrecking investment that matters.,197
12Xpert,it might be but i think it can be a fine line. they way the law has treated individual responsibility in criminal cases has evolved over time. it isn't fixed.,158
12Xpert,"why lfc fans love klopp: updated.

-now the best club in the world according to  
-three years of sustained improvement
-quality of team surpassed all of his immediate predecessors

attn:",187
12Xpert,i'll wager the 'poor' just love being talked about in this patronising 'we know best what's right for you' way. reminds me of brexit. shit did just use the b-word?,163
12Xpert,so there is the opportunity to twist things this way and that to suit the argument without actually presenting the actual data that we need to talk about this properly.,168
12Xpert,dixon-coles altough being relatively simple compared to other methods (bivariate poisson zero-inflated poisson negative binomial etc.) really improves predictions. dixon-coles rho parameter is league-dependent and estimated values are shown below,246
12Xpert,but if youre ruined along the way perseverance doesnt come into to it.  the trouble society doesnt get to see those who did the same as him and were ruined.,156
12Xpert,"from the paper talent vs luck:
the role of randomness in success and failure this is the essential take home message for bettors. stop judging your success by your profits.",172
12Xpert,no idea. i dont collect data on them. but you can use my woc method to find some at soft books provided youre happy to risk those accounts being restricted.,156
12Xpert,real live tipsters are almost always full of shit usually they don't know it. i don't need to make kelly simulations. flat stakes is just fine for this purpose thanks.,167
12Xpert,theres really no contradiction im consistent in saying that the proportion of sharps at a sharp book is too small to reveal itself in the wider distribution of all performances.,177
12Xpert,mugs. lots of them despite the gambling commission's best efforts (and mine). their existence in large numbers is precisely why betfair went down the sportsbook route in thee first place.,187
12Xpert,well done. in which case i'd keep it to yourself.  will always be looking for ways to figure out how you do it so you can't do it any more.,139
12Xpert,so youre saying people cant think for themselves peter? or if they can but dont think the right things youd like to tell them how they ought to think right?,156
12Xpert,not sure i agree. the entropy of  opening v closing football odds is effectively same so doesn't really give much useful information about any difference in efficiency between the two.,184
12Xpert,"finally here is my take on the efficiency of a tennis match betting market at  perhaps  you will find it interesting. 
and thanks to  of  for providing the analysis data.",170
12Xpert,still the fact that actual roi is a lot lower might suggest some of the sports are not fully efficient at pinny. soccer seems to be the only reliable one.,154
12Xpert,"rufus on what's wrong with the tipster model. quite a lot actually.

don't ever assume ""guaranteed"" means guaranteed in the betting industry. that's my  $ 0 .0 2 's worth.",171
12Xpert,eu make a special case for northern ireland because it is a special case. they would need to get over their obsession about treaty rules or make a new treaty.,158
12Xpert,equally thinking you can counter pathways going wrong via prohibition and moral shaming (which incidentally is what the latest betregret campaign did) also misunderstands gambling disorder and addiction in general.,214
12Xpert,no they definitely take into account biases. in particular the favourite longshot bias but i remove the influence of that when estimating the  fair odds for this kind of analyses.,179
12Xpert,thanks for letting me know. i must have forgotten to run my team name macro. ill make sure this is done when i uoload the results most likely wednesday evening.,160
12Xpert,hello  i'm just wondering what it takes to get your partners' customer service team to action a response. they wrote this end of may. still not been paid since february.,169
12Xpert,first main leagues match data added (b1  d2  f2 ). given the new data and added workload i have decided instead to upload on monday mornings rather than sunday nights.,167
12Xpert,well not necessarily just wanting to stress that unless you have proper evidence to support the view that clv hypothesis is meaningless you shouldn't really claim that it is meaningless.,186
12Xpert,rank probability scores used for measurement of how good your model forecasting is lower scores better. presumably green arrows better red arrows worse as a relative measure across the models.,192
12Xpert,"found not to have implied knowledge can be applied to sports betting to ensure success. well you couldn't make this up could you. 
skybet 'winners' already knew this didn't they.",178
12Xpert,i'm not talking about nannying. i'm talking about a proper education into forecasting prediction modelling chance randomness luck skill causation correlation risk taking loss aversion cognitive bias neurochemisty behavioural evolution.,235
12Xpert,but everyone else can see the teams performing too. and if you interpret those things in the same ways that everyone else is it's just the same as pre-match no?,160
12Xpert,is this conclusion based on actual data of how targeted content changes gambler behaviour or is it based on a moral desire to curtain gambling advertising and by extension gambling?,181
12Xpert,only  not the bookmakers that offer the prices available to make this system happen. of course they tend to get a bit upset if you try to exploit them systematically.,166
12Xpert,brilliant. lake wobegon effect in full effect.. well over 5 0  %  of the sample believe they are at least average or above average in that sample. a logical impossibility.,171
12Xpert,he better start winning soon because there will be others who will want to take his place. personally i don't think he'll ever win a gs he's not good enough.,157
12Xpert,"i'm happy to announce that pre-orders for ""statistical sports models in excel"" are now live on amazon. i'm confident these spreadsheet models + techniques will help many people get started.",189
12Xpert,your words not mine. don't presume to be in my head. people do that a lot i've noticed in life. maybe it's me that's the problem. i'll live with that.,150
12Xpert,"would you able able post a screenshot of the  's written response to you. interested to see how advertising ""savvy"" is considered acceptable when betting ""savvy"" gets your account closed.",187
12Xpert,as i type im watching  promote their acca boosts on the telly. if kenny alexander was sincere then hed pull their ads now not wait for others to join him.,154
12Xpert,goo luck with that ray. history is littered with the failures of prohibition. you don't control anyone by forcing people to behave a certain way. that's not how humans evolved.,176
12Xpert,good for them that doesn't surprise me. for matters unrelated to account restrictions i have always found them to be the model bookmaker something i can't extend to many others.,177
12Xpert,"at a sharp book i think the figure will be 1  %  or even 1  % . 
i've set out my arguments about this in detail in my last book.",128
12Xpert,perhaps. that's why i find european notation the best -  you just invert to get the implied probability. with uk fractional and us moneyline my brain farts all the time.,169
12Xpert,this system is a result of data mining and pattern finding. hence it is completely worthless until it can demonstrate a causal explanation for why the profits happened. here's why...,182
12Xpert,all of the disadvantages of living in a democracy are outweighed by the disadvantage of being prohibited to think and say what you think in a regime that is not.,161
12Xpert,an un-ending depression is the consequence. i don't give a shit what the research says about recessions and mortality that would kill and impoverish far more people that this virus.,181
12Xpert,here i listed them by matched so you can see which are the popular ones you can change the list to by time to see the most recent coming up,139
12Xpert,but for sure if were instead talking about his dispositions allowing him to be a faster learner than others then certainly we are talking about luck: genetics upbringing environment etc.,186
12Xpert,you and ent have constantly called me out for saying hardly anyone can beat pinnacle basing your entire argument on the fact that i cant. your position is total nonsense,169
12Xpert,"but until when? that's not credible either. you can't have this season void. i will completely lose my shit. waited 3 0  years. ""1 0 0  %  it's not on!!!""",154
12Xpert,let's ask them how much they stake then. and let's ask  to do a new poll which takes these different things into account. in fact you start the new poll.,153
12Xpert,but the point is if the points accumulation rate is similar you would expect a bigger difference between top and bottom after 3 5  games compared to 2 7  games.,160
12Xpert,and greater efficiency will mean higher limits so the bookmaker takes more money off squares. paying sharps is just like an agent fee to increase overall turnover and profit no?,177
12Xpert,and you think that not knowing whether youre betting against a problem gambler somehow exempts you from moral criticism? would seem to me to be a version of wilful blindness.,174
12Xpert,interestingly even the losing draws are longer on average at close which suggests a lot of the reduction in the vig between open and close goes onto the the draw.,162
12Xpert,not many games this week but here are my latest  predictions for 2 0 1 9 -2 0  (method: ). attack strength  defence weakness ratings shown by team. data by,155
12Xpert,i am very confident that i could set lines here that did not correlate 1 :1 . indeed at a push i could probably get close to y = -x.,132
12Xpert,if pinnacle's internal line was systematically different to their published line then it would be systematically different to outcomes since the published line and the outcomes correlate 1 :1 .,193
12Xpert,"how far do you take the ""losing less"" argument? i could try to educate people to only back favourites and then really hot favourites and they would lose even less.",163
12Xpert,i suppose the interesting question is what is the smallest sample of matches where efficiency starts to appear and whether than can be uses to make any predictions about roi.,174
12Xpert,more trading doesn't imply more skilled winners (as a percentage of total players). if the structure of the competition doesn't change then by definition the percentage of winners won't either.,193
12Xpert,there's your proof. if they were fca regulated they would lose their licence over such a statement but of course if they were fca regulated they wouldn't be saying that.,169
12Xpert,a look at liverpool's underlying shot metrics. number of shots (on target) goals and xg figures per match for the last 4  seasons in attack/defense. some consistent trends in there!,181
12Xpert,but that begs the question: if the tipster can bet himself why bother selling the advice. would only really apply if the tipster was unable to bet for some reason.,163
12Xpert,"for most markets not. there would be more vig weight on the +3 0 0 . it's called the favourite-longshot bias
here's a couple of articles i've written about it.",159
12Xpert,i thought you wanted to see what sort of thing could happen by chance over 3 0 0 0  wagers. the excel calc shows you the distribution of possible performance.,158
12Xpert,"yes.
uk data suggests it's been declining recently although that could simple be variance.
no. no addiction is a good this. nothing special about gambling.
no idea. let's find out.",180
12Xpert,just change the expected mean. for my p-value calculator i assume expected = 0  % . but in my yield distribution calculator you can change it to whatever you want.,163
12Xpert,probably where the edges lie before they are explored away and replaced with others. its not about forecasting the future accurately its about doing it better than your opponent.,178
12Xpert,in looking at the last 4  season results -comparing jockey wins vs the odds of their horses. kevin brouder is something else. performing a phenomenal win rate above expected.,174
12Xpert,indeed so but not the best to level stakes. that honour goes to norwich by virtue of beating manchester city. liverpool are 4 th. (lsp = level stakes profit).,158
12Xpert,that's a different story and an different argument. it has a lot of merit but i don't think it is served too well by joining it with this one.,142
12Xpert,sure we can argue that we need bigger sample that this to prove anything. but the only way to measure if a line is accurate is ultimately against results.,154
12Xpert,would love to see the data not being an xg aficionado myself. if true it would add further weight to the claim of being the greatest of all time.,145
12Xpert,"the endless ""let's blame everyone else like the media or the racists instead of ourselves"" is the reason a decent man with a broken record political ideology got scuppered.",172
12Xpert,if you like using percentage staking (e.g. kelly) then my latest  article explains how your range of performances is log-normally distributed. i've built another little calculator for this too.,193
12Xpert,because i've only included the period where the league is played over 3 8  games. the first two were 4 2  games and they won the second of those.,145
12Xpert,updated timeline showing the 2 0 1 9 -2 0   title race based on my predictions (method at ). plenty of twists and turns ahead i suspect.... data by,147
12Xpert,i month a week even a day is a long time in a bayesian world of complex systems. people who try to pass simulations off as forecasts are fools.,143
12Xpert,well of course we know but its a nice way to prove it when a tout says you have no evidence that i cant do 6 5  % .,115
12Xpert,if it a large number which i guess is the case then that would imply that there is marginal efficiency superiority of pinny over the sharps they are using.,155
12Xpert,latest  2 0 1 9 /2 0  season form tables. rolling four-match points totals for the league season so far. championship league one league two national league. data from,166

12Xpert,new  predictions for 2 0 1 9 -2 0  (method at ) after 8  games. attack strength  defence weakness ratings shown by team. a good weekend for  data by,148
12Xpert,ah well in that case my methods won't be so useful. best for 2 - and 3 -way markets. you want shin method for removing the overround for racing.,144
12Xpert,and we hold referendums for such things here like changing the voting system. by default eu treaty changes are of constitutional importance so nations should hold referendums on them.,183
12Xpert,i did not see it but id suggest thered be a case for insisting bets should not stand provided you requested that long before settlement before result was known.,160
12Xpert,"those new to this can find the method behind my approach here: 
beware you will run the risk of killing your betting accounts if you use it with disguise.",154
12Xpert,"main leagues weekend fixtures available a day early since i probably won't have time to do them friday.

wocs available too.
extra league will be available later tonight (hopefully)",181
12Xpert,"yeah found it now. 

my comment still stands. you'd need to show me your precise record of bets/lays with odds and results. then we'll know how good this is.",157
12Xpert,indeed on the face of it these seem contradictory working in the opposite direction. but i suppose these these biases are acting on subtly different things. all very fascinating.,178
12Xpert,ok to my knowledge i never published the file of match results on the website. perhaps you are confusing it with the wisdom of crowds results which is available.,161
12Xpert,rupert murdoch's newspapers can be freely held to account in the uk. we can't say that about the state-regulated press in cuba venezuala north korea or china for example.,170
12Xpert,but if they do they should prove they that they have something worth buying. my inability to offer something really worth buying has absolutely nothing to do with that.,168
12Xpert,in general it is only a few who shout the loudest and make it seem like everyone thinks the same. i think it's called the intolerance of the minority.,150
12Xpert,overall since august 2 0 1 5  the system is performing to expectation. actual 4 .4 4  %  expected 4 .1 9  %  from 8 8 8 9  selections.,134
12Xpert,"""the law of small numbers is a cognitive bias where people show a tendency to believe that a relatively small number of observations will closely reflect the general population""",177
12Xpert,if true it would support my argument about anchoring bias. the problem is how can we test this without knowing what the 'true' result probabilities for each match are?,167
12Xpert,they might have won it if financial fair play was a real thing rather than just an acronym used by sports journalists. perhaps also if committing doping violations mattered.,173
12Xpert,trying to find out if this is an affiliate-wide breach of tcs as might be indicated here - . if you have anything to contribute here please do so.,146
12Xpert,"reaching out to find out if  affiliate programme have ""forgotten"" to retag your pre- (november 2 0 1 8 ) referrals and refuse to talk to you about it.",150
12Xpert,but compared relatively to closing odds using the method here the are clearly not as good as closing and opening to closing is a goo predictive tool for roi,156
12Xpert,i was saying what nish said made no sense. have a read here for my attempt at what makes sense. the part you want starts page 5  (bookmaker's margin).,150
12Xpert,when it's impossible to know what a true outcome probability is before it's happened where do you begin with this.?easy in dice effectively impossible in complex systems like sports.,182
12Xpert,i'm not studying what goes into it just seeing how it performs relative to bookmakers. started today by seeing what sort of profit it returns to closing pinny prices.,166
12Xpert,the bigger problem is still outstanding: you simply can't claim to have discovered a profitable betting system with methodology like this and   has crunched the numbers to confirm this.,185
12Xpert,"actually i don't argue that  i study the data and i see that for ""almost everyone"" there is nothing but chance. that is not the same as saying ""everyone"".",154
12Xpert,"""epidemic of gambling addiction""
wasn't aware that the growth in gambling addiction is following a logarithmic trend. largely treading water according to official figures. maybe the officials are lying.",202
12Xpert,"actually it didnt if you read the full ruling.
although matched betting was not itself gambling because its purpose was to facilitate gambling we considered that this was irresponsible.",185
12Xpert,smiling at someone and seeing them smile back is not something that can be measured but it is far more meaningful than adding a year to an unhappy life.,152
12Xpert,different stakes. if the bettor is staking 1 1 0  to win 1 0 0  the bookmaker is effectively staking 1 0 0  to win 1 1 0 .,122
12Xpert,hardly a selling point. i can already buy stuff with normal money simply using my thumb print on a phone that no-one else touches. hardly ever use cash anymore.,160
12Xpert,these are my three. ssss is best in my opinion but many still tell me they like the first (fosb) even though i think it's a bit basic now.,138

12Xpert,it would. but obviously my p-value approach makes many assumptions and no correlated bets is one of them. the vast majority of tipsters i verified did not have any.,164
12Xpert,nonsense. if your account is showing a favourable balance because you've been betting huge underdogs in a random fashion they'll probably upgrade you to vip. oops that's another argument.,187
12Xpert,indeed but it's the way you seem like you're sneering at other people's enjoyment as if it's less intelligent than yours. financially yours may be more rewarding that's true.,174
12Xpert,"i would reword that as the ""hope of winning."" but this fails to answer why people look for chances of winning or hope to win in the first place.",144
12Xpert,"if the value on the bet is 4 .6 6  %  (0 .0 4 6 6 ) then the kelly stake is:

12Xpert,much easier with moneyline than handicap. just divide the odds you bet by the closing odds once you've removed the margin from the latter. that's what you do right?,164
12Xpert,and here's the reverse: yield versus closing to opening line ratio betting at the closing line. conclusion: closing line is relatively speaking much more information-rich than the opening line.,193
12Xpert,the hard work come from years of trial and error failures drawdowns doubting oneself odds slippage. if doing this was so easy everyone would do it. why aren't they?,164
12Xpert,right but again this is just a sample of 1 . show me a sample of 1 0 0 0 0  where that is the case as an average.,113
12Xpert,surely you mean some players underperform because they are unlucky whilst other players overperform because they are lucky but messi breaks the normal distribution because he is a god.,184

12Xpert,yes ill accept that. i personally wouldnt have them winning this much majority. more like -1 0  to +5 0  would be my 9 5  %  confidence limits.,143
12Xpert,yes maybe but if they are beating it you know for sure somethings going on since beating the line over even smallish samples will not happen by chance.,151
12Xpert,but human beings appear to have a wonderful tendency to over bet hot teams which implies cold teams might offer some value. see for yourself if that's true.,156
12Xpert,you could choose to analyse the data for just these two leagues but you may not have enough of it to eliminate variance that will influence your conclusions.,157

12Xpert,ok looking forward to it but just as a rough ball-park figure what were you expecting to be able to deliver with this? as a win  % ?,132
12Xpert,you'll only properly be able to answer these things with data analysis. blogabet is a waste of time because it allows soft books. pyckio is the obvious choice.,159
12Xpert,you don't need sharps for bookmakers to be risk averse on longshots. just walk into a casino and see what their limit are for different bets in roulette.,153
12Xpert,my singles. my ability to find value not as consistent as woc though! luckies coming soon. i'm living on the green line. sounds like a good song title!,151

12Xpert,the history of political and economic forecasting is a litter basket of rolled dice. if course if you believe this best strategy is to massively short the pound.,161

12Xpert,"using the calculator of the blog post  initially created by  here: 
i obtain a probability of being profitable by chance of 0 .0 9 9  (really too soon).",152
12Xpert,that's typically not something i offer. those sorts of things can be created by users from the raw data. i've always just been about offering the raw data.,155
12Xpert,but there is still plenty of soft book closing odds value so pinnacle opening late cannot be the only reason why they are more efficient than soft books.,153
12Xpert,the reason is that recreationals intentionally use inefficient odds to sell the message that they offer great odds then ban when a customer systematically tries to exploit them.,177
12Xpert,i'll knock it. when you breach financial fair play and commit doping violations and uefa couldn't care less because it's better for their wallet then anything is possible.,171
12Xpert,google are good at search algorithms i'm guessing not so much at beating a betting market. i imagine that like for fivethirtyeight these things are just page filler.,165
12Xpert,why are  signing non disclosure agreements with affiliates to stop them revealing information about what appears to be their breach of contract concerning the payment of commissioned earned?,190
12Xpert,"for pros it's all about variance. nearly all would-be tipsters just don't understand it indeed they don't even see it they more usually prefer just to go ""booooooommmm!""",169
12Xpert,unfortunately in science publication as for tips records we often don't get to see the boring nothing patterns with p-values  0 .0 5  because they don't further careers.,169
12Xpert,my thoughts are that regulation/prohibition is rarely effective. education is always better. and that can start with explaining that gambling isn't a moral bad it's part of life.,178
12Xpert,but in the sense i'm not looking at team/player fundamentals then yes it's not particularly fundamental. i've left that to the best bookmaker to do that for me.,160
12Xpert,i'm not assuming they are the best out there. i'm arguing based on data i have had access to that they are the best i've seen so far.,133
12Xpert,furthermore we don't know exactly how bookmakers respond to punters betting biases how much they try t equalise money and how much they try to exploit square money.,164
12Xpert,and this will need more than just printing money. this will need underwriting salaries with real cash; for months and months and hundreds of million maybe billions globally.,173
12Xpert,still don't know the answer. if you meant me i suggest you take a look at all the abusive judgements he's posted about me before passively joining in.,150
12Xpert,of course so long as i can have unlimited resources too and then neither of us will go bankrupt i will just have a bigger infinity than you.,140

12Xpert,humans and in particular anglo-saxon western humans are  obsessed with counting and measuring things and less the quality and meaningfulness of what it is they are actually measuring.,183

12Xpert,there's a hint that the bias is weakening (more bettors aware of it?) but i'd not like to stake my reputation on saying that's definitely statistically significant.,164
12Xpert,makes sense. i've been accused numerous times by traders for arbing when in fact i've never actually closed a bookmakers' arb in my life (just exchange trades).,160
12Xpert,i think you're right. but that is part of the problem. time shouldn't be a factor so long as bets have no memories i.e. they are independent.,141
12Xpert,working on an article for  hopefully it will walk readers through a domain knowledge related troubleshooting process i've found helpful. should be finished in a few days.,170
12Xpert,i should i used my original seasonal cumulative score method (the one in the book) rather than the last 6  matches score method (in the pinnacle article).,154

12Xpert,i thought you'd better be able to calculate the probability of a horse wining by measuring how long it was since you last fed and watered it.,141
12Xpert,and one biased moral view doesnt define it. society needs to have a discussion about gambling which isnt served if we only ever hear one prohibitionary voice.,158
12Xpert,in which case i should have long since been worm food. as i often say to the cold calling accident claims scammers you're talking to an apparition.,147
12Xpert,i know you don't care about any of this. for you it's not real world just academic statto talk. so let's not waste each other's time anymore.,141

12Xpert,meanwhile society misses the opportunity to use gambling as a way of educating people about judgement under uncertainty and so much of life is precisely about that.,164
12Xpert,as a skeptic i would say that if you still have any recreational bookmaker accounts left at all after betting regularly they clearly don't agree with you.,154
12Xpert,this is precisely it. which is why women's tennis and athletics is virtually on a level playing field with men's in terms of building narratives and stories.,157
12Xpert,eating disorder strikes me as possibly the worst of them all. i found louis theroux's talking to anorexia hugely revealing disturbing upsetting and inspiring in equal measure.,175
12Xpert,the number of no-show sharps like you will be but a tiny proportion of the number of no-show squares. survivorship bias is much stronger in that direction.,155
12Xpert,assumptions about margin distribution are of course critical. in this article i explain why i think bookmakers generally lead to introducing a favourite-longshot bias in their odds,180
12Xpert,almost everything published about markets implies that bias are consistently smaller than the costs of playing. if somehow this is systematically wrong then this should be published.,182
12Xpert,well a bookmaker can do that because he has the vig on his side. i thought we were talking about players where the vig is against them.,135
12Xpert,indeed 4 5  %  would small sample bad luck. if they knew they could do 4 5  %  long term then would then simply bet against themselves,134
12Xpert,maybe i've got it all wrong. maybe it's only customers with nigel as a middle name who get restricted. but we don't know coz it doesn't say.,140
12Xpert,i think this is the argument for why you're not a proper fan if you bet against your team because it takes you to logically absurd places.,138

12Xpert,from memory i haven't done any specific testing on them (maybe brier score or something). i've compared the relative performances of different bookmakers. for example see here.,176

12Xpert,you can get them from oddsportal. you could also see if indatabetcom have them (for a small fee). they do cover other sports not sure about nfl.,144
12Xpert,yes that would be of interest. either the post data mining results have been unlucky or there was never anything causal and you're just seeing mean regression.,159

12Xpert,yes you could although you may want to test with a sample of historical odds how whether this bookie is less efficient compared to pinnacle.,140
12Xpert,im pretty sure that was the intention. no arrogance needs to be implied either just a clever psychological tool to reveal a common behavioural bias.,148
12Xpert,it's a structural bias where fewer than 5 0  %  of favourites cover the spread. reported by levitt in nfl (around 4 8  % ).,123
12Xpert,but this doesn't tell the whole story. here's a time series of cumulative percentage beating the spread with ascending handicap moving from largest to smallest.,160
12Xpert,"3  books all bettors serious about winning need to read:
 ""sharper""
 ""winning sports betting""
 "" the logic of sports betting""

start with these three. seriously.",161
12Xpert,"have a read.

for sharp books like  there's a strong case for saying they are. i've not investigated whether this is true for softer books.",139
12Xpert,would always be nice to test with real data. i just need a few seasons of recent 1  times 2  closing prices from the exchange.,126
12Xpert,i'm glad someone finally said it was fun. [note to those aggressivey representing the anti gambling lobby: it's f......g fun that's why people do it.,149
12Xpert,there is a school of thought that says all technical analysis is akin to alchemy. i have to admit i am sympathetic with that view.,130
12Xpert,i can provide all communicatory evidence to back up what i've saying here. either the  affiliate team is completely incompetent or they are something worse.,156
12Xpert,compared to the average draws return of the full sample of matches (5 0 2 1 0 ) which was -2 .8 2  % .,102
12Xpert,"besides others have already showed that since going ""live"" the bets have failed over quite large samples. so what's the point of all of this?",141
12Xpert,with turkey suspending football there are now no fixtures to provide for either main or extra leagues. hope you're all keeping well at this time.,145
12Xpert,true global numbers will be millions imo. take a look at how spanish flu spread: in and out in 3  waves within 1 0  months.,123
12Xpert,but what makes the odds what they are? they are a combination of the bookmakers model and then the models used by their sharp customers.,136
12Xpert,then set yourself up as a proper tipster instead of using these shitty services that let you down and get verified by a proper verifier.,136
12Xpert,cue all the fucksticks who tell me i say all betting and tipping is luck. over to you boys. you know you cant help yourselves.,126
12Xpert,ill go one better. ill provide 0  tips per year. that means i have an expected profit superior to 9 9  % + of tipsters.,119
12Xpert,"if you're motivated you'll get around the limitations.

what are your slbet limits on table tennis mr. real world man? have the restricted you account?",151
12Xpert,yes it might although it would be hard to unpick what the source of it was whether punters being irrational or  looking to exploit that.,136
12Xpert,whilst the former even without the margin would still probably beat 9 9  %  of customers over the long term (removing the effects of chance).,141
12Xpert,again totally meaningless waffle. whats the size of the tipster population from which he chose these tipsters? do you even have and idea at all?,144
12Xpert,"if by ""doing well"" you mean making profits then depending on your market and odds it could take many hundreds and sometimes thousands of bets.",142
12Xpert,is doing more data collection on tipster mean regression. we know there are few sharps out there but they are still very hard to find.,134
12Xpert,ive talked about the possibility of shading by bookmakers on  before and the mathematical justification for it if bettors do indeed behave as is reported.,154
12Xpert,in this example you can't tell whether the bookmaker has moved because of your action only or because they already know your action is sharp.,141
12Xpert,"""the amount that they pay out is increasing as the market grows.""

that sounds just like a ponzi. if it's not that what is it?",126
12Xpert,"yes so am i so is trademate sports. so can anyone. just read this:

but chris and i are upfront about what's being offered here.",128
12Xpert,but simply picking out 1  or 2  proven tipsters does not refute the fact that almost all tipsters are actually useless and are selling luck.,140
12Xpert,but this still begs the question: why is it a vice? and if it is why can't we be responsible for our own well being?,116
12Xpert,"you ""feel"". but have you actually researched it? you might be right but i need data not feelings or things we want to be true.",126
12Xpert,"individual biases dont map to collective ones.
taleb on how be is dangerous bs. would be interested to know what your tutor thinks of this.",139
12Xpert,it would. but how do you know when it's happening? you can't simply say i know because it would be extraordinary for it not to.,127
12Xpert,and if it was easy to 'know' then everyone would 'know' then the market would evolve to a place where it wasn't easy to 'know'.,127
12Xpert,clearly there is a lot wrong with they way this  piece is positioning itself not least over the lack of transparency on the data source.,136
12Xpert,updated all the weekly roundup charts here  and here are the latest week 2 1  roundup thanks to  for providing the data over at,127
12Xpert,"will have to wait im away for a couple of days. or you could mail me and ill try to reply later tonight.
joseph",111
12Xpert,remind me: how many matches had it been since  lost at home after leading at half time? illustrates  the scale of the problem facing,132
12Xpert,"my favourite ever blog post of yours. excellent account of why bookmakers shouldn't care about restricting ""winners"" even if none of us like that.",146
12Xpert,i haven't. if it works bet it and make money. if others have already thought of it and the edge has gone basically irrelevant.,126
12Xpert,at the scale of everything by definition there must be full efficiency because the probability of something happening is 1  and something always happens.,153
12Xpert,"yes that would be right. but by saying ""wins 5 2  %  of the time"" this implies it has to be tested against results.",115
12Xpert,that's what i'd like to know. we can measure it by number of sigma from the mean. hopefully  will give me that data soon.,121
12Xpert,"yeah that's interesting in itself. i presume the differences are not statistically significant right?

what i was really hoping for was a player distribution.",158
12Xpert,they have skin in the game hence better. if you don't get punished for fucking up you have less motivation to avoid fucking up.,127
12Xpert,if this analysis was even remotely correct the price for valencia v chelsea draw would be 9 /1 . its 2 .7 /1 .,110
12Xpert,what if it's not her fault she behaves the way she does? for example sociopathy narcissism (genetic) or things that happened in childhood (phenotypic).,151
12Xpert,if the soft book prices are systematically longer than the pinnacle prices then there's nothing really sophisticated at all. just a version of woc.,147
12Xpert,or more importantly realise that uk bookmakers won't let be anything else although they don't explicitly tell you this in their terms and conditions.,149
12Xpert,why stop at advertising? if you think gambling is bad why not ban it? assuming you have a valid argument that it is bad.,120
12Xpert,stranger things have happened like alaves beating barcelona on 1 0 th september 2 0 1 6  closing price 3 2 .3 2 .,113
12Xpert,just because you don't it's doesn't mean everyone else doesn't either. if you have data that tells it differently show it. otherwise just fo.,141
12Xpert,i'm not saying punters would bet level stakes i'm simply saying i use levels stakes to see what the percentage returns would be hypothetically.,143
12Xpert,i'm simply asking you to prove what you say that the outcomes of punters' betting doesn't look a lot a random distribution. still waiting.,138
12Xpert,"just watched it.

12Xpert,if you're nearly 3  million up by the time bet3 6 5  drop your custom then consider yourself a very smart and lucky winner.,123
12Xpert,here it is. could you still believe in your system after a 2 0 0 0 -bet long underperformance most of it making losses?,119
12Xpert,id call that very weak significance. following taleb id be hoping for p0 .0 0 1 . maybe well get there with more tips.,118
12Xpert,the ratio of the price you bet against the closing price is a good predictor of expected roi if the closing prices are efficient.,129
12Xpert,theres little point in holding a referendum if parliament will never agree to one of the outcomes. democracy is more than just parliamentary law.,145
12Xpert,i thought i had done that but i was having some ftp server trouble so i guess it didn't work. i've now added them.,114
12Xpert,every time the uk scored var would rule it out on the grounds that obsessing with rules about shit is more important than life.,127
12Xpert,is it possible to get that far? after one bet where you beat the closing price they will restrict stakes to  $ 1 .,114
12Xpert,"it always depends on your (subjective) objectives. and those depend upon your risk tolerances. and those depend on your life philosophy. 
might this help?",154
12Xpert,typically associated with basketball the hot hand fallacy can also be applied in soccer.  examines how you can exploit this phenomenon in soccer  markets:,154
12Xpert,so here is part 2 . do bookmaker's bias an nba spread market? hmmm i'm not sure. levitt's work might be out of date.,116
12Xpert,as for the media controlling us its a handy conspiracy to trot out when it suits which at its worst strays into anti semitism.,126
12Xpert,so if i dropped the others it wouldn't be the end of the world for you? i will still include the max and avg.,109
12Xpert,life is full of risk and uncertainty. anything that equips us with tools better able to handle those things is surely a positive force.,135
12Xpert,unfortunately i will not be able to upload tonights spanish 2 nd division fixture. the remainder for the weekend will be available saturday morning.,148
12Xpert,this. survivorship bias and regression to the mean are two things most punters following tipsters either don't know don't understand or choose to deny.,151
12Xpert,matchday 3 8  to come but this is how insanely off the scale  and  are compared to the last 2 3  top flight seasons.,116
12Xpert,after all pinnacle's opening odds are pretty efficient on average and don't look a whole lot worse compared to closing odds in this chart.,138
12Xpert,how is this advert getting past     regulations that insist gambling should not be linking to financial success and a means of success in life?,143
12Xpert,only the most precise if we are to assume that pinny are looking for true prices. they might not be to exploit squares' biases.,127
12Xpert,i can't remember if we ever did a ttest on your actual v expected profits. i suspect yours will show a statistically significant difference.,140
12Xpert,e1  e2  e3  ec and f2 's next round playing monday/tuesday added. the remainder of midweek fixtures will be available usual time tuesday morning.,145
12Xpert,good work! the 2 .0  %  increasing the past two seasons in the top leagues in eng fra ger ita and spa is striking.,114
12Xpert,i believe  may be doing something with ranked probability scores to look at how bookmakers models compare. perhaps he can give you some info.,141
12Xpert,that's true but if  odds offer a better model what's the point in following 5 3 8  you might as well follow the odds.,117
12Xpert,ah right so the semi accurate way  is to count the deaths and then make up a number? glad we cleared that one up.,113
12Xpert,now's a valuable window of opportunity though to get into the public consciousness in the same way women's football managed via the world cup.,142
12Xpert,"right now we still have the english national league german divisions 1  and 2  and the turkish superleague playing this weekend.

wocs available to.",148
12Xpert,i talk a lot about the neurochemistry of anticipation of uncertain outcomes. dopamine. in the book there are hundreds of references to relevant articles.,153
12Xpert,so youre telling me you submit a bookmaker and price and they change it. well im going to ask for their view about that.,120
12Xpert,"we are talking about tipsters.

tipster = bettor who give or sells others their advice in the form of what picks to bet on.",123
12Xpert,"""it's so weird how mostly right wing people seem to think that scientific consensus is somehow part of some broad conspiracy to emasculate them""",144
12Xpert,do you think such a person has emitted more or less carbon than a thirty-something extinction rebellion activist living a middle class uk lifestyle?,148
12Xpert,and me. although with a 1 2 -month loss my profit trend is starting to look more like a covid-1 9 -infected stock market.,121
12Xpert,since when did brexiters want to do away with free trade? you can have free trade without political union. the eec managed it superbly.,135
12Xpert,so either way gambling is immoral. which makes it all the more amusing why some catholic churches have used the lottery to raise revenue.,137
12Xpert,ah anthony youre only seeing those ads because of your online profile. absolutely nothing to do with the mails hypocrisy as a moral prohibitionist.,147
12Xpert,this is part 2 . you may need to read part 1  for it to make sense if you're minded to follow this up.,102
12Xpert,has already made a suggestion. it's just seeding in first round matches meaning you won't get as many equally rated players meeting each other.,143
12Xpert,i think seeding is a good explanation so if yuu get that in sports like darts and snooker we could look for it there.,117
12Xpert,that's interesting. i'm still not clear about how you determined what a sharp bet is versus what a square bet is. can you elaborate?,132
12Xpert,broadly yes as more and more people have been joining the party doing more and more similar things. but obviously there will be exceptions.,139
12Xpert,the only way you get that is via the paradox of skill but then that implies those profits are more a reflection of luck.,120
12Xpert,here's another perspective one that i think i was trying to articulate but didn't have the knowledge or level of sophistication to do so.,137
12Xpert,try asking . they have totals and averages so that means they must have the match data somewhere. they might give it to you.,124
12Xpert,and clever chaps like you an  somehow find only the matches which are anchored steamers. which is why clv does not correlate with roi.,134
12Xpert,if the biases are not deliberate then they will be errors not biases. a bias by definition is systematic and must have a cause.,127

12Xpert,or is this just another stick to beat the industry with without actually carrying out a proper investigation just a a load of suppositions?,139
12Xpert,for sure. 1 0  stakes lasted me thousands of bets at one brand. but much more that that and you start to get noticed.,117
12Xpert,which takes us back to the start. broadly i would agree it should be banned but then consider doing that for other sectors too.,127
12Xpert,i recall similar arguments were made by some when the national lottery was introduced. look at us now a nation of degenerate gambling addicts.,142
12Xpert,as always education and awareness will be the key not prohibition over regulation and patronising drivel from the likes of the  about this topic.,145
12Xpert,ok but tell everyone that if they stop being lazy and go against the crowd there's a pot of gold waiting. what will happen?,123
12Xpert,just quote your data source open it up to scrutiny so others can attempt to reproduce what youve claimed. then youll gain some respect.,135
12Xpert,never a good look calling people thick. a bit like members of broad church political parties calling dissenters scum and fascists. self defeating.,146
12Xpert,i would agree such ads are misleading and should be banned. from memory i think the asa did rule against the ladbrokes ad.,122
12Xpert,"but what if they could't bet on who was going to score first or any horse race?

horse racing would basically be finished.",122
12Xpert,"yes that's correct but the inefficiency is minimal because the proportion of long term ""winners"" is tiny in comparison to the bettor population.",144
12Xpert,then report the news factually rather than morally. explain why they use this economic model for bookmaking. it's not illegal to use it.,136
12Xpert,no they won't be close. 2 0 1 9  is an aberration. f-l bias will still be in effect. this is just variance.,107
12Xpert,next month pinnacle will be publish another on the bayes factor that will also offer a tool to help you answer this question.,125
12Xpert,prices aren't that incorrect which implies bookmakers know how to make lines and hence then must be modelling them. if in doubt ask,131
12Xpert,ok so if you are betting these at pinny then that's a possible reason why they don't 'see' you. anyway great record nonetheless.,128
12Xpert,to reiterate because the method uses pinnacle's odds to measure 'true' probabilities it's methodologically impossible for value bets to be found at pinnacle.,157

12Xpert,thats not something ive ever argued for nor would i. there was a referendum. parliament voted in large numbers to respect the result.,133
12Xpert,i wasn't rude you were. i simply said i cant keep explaining this. i don't know how else to. maybe this will help.,114
12Xpert,so that graph gradient should be 1  if closing prices are efficient. if it is less than 1  this implies they are not.,117
12Xpert,very gradually. still not convinced bookmakers can allow systematic biases beyond the safety net of their margin. they would just get exploited away.,149

12Xpert,but more importantly anything like this that could promote false hope and encourage more problem gambling is just wrong and shouldnt be permitted.,146
12Xpert,still false. its should say there is nothing that will do anything at all. even suggesting there are mathematical strategies is a con.,134

12Xpert,if you are unable to have compassion for katie hopkins despite her visceral hatred towards others then youve missed the whole point.,132

12Xpert,again if we try to use 5 3 8  predictions as a measure of truth (betting opening pinnacle odds) we get this.,108
12Xpert,absolutely but with out timings impossible. i suppose the best i can do is opening lines and i'll get on to that.,113
12Xpert,not to worry i've got a couple of seasons of data form github. i'll get to it in the next few days.,99
12Xpert,im happy for you to challenge clvh if you have something meaningful to challenge it with. systems that mean regress arent it.,125

12Xpert,no i agree but i suspect if i asked betfair they wouldn't give me the true figure so it's all there is.,103
12Xpert,you don't look at markets/tipsters 5  %  edge because you're not a professional bettor like  at least that what you suggested anyway.,133
12Xpert,i believe they will take advantage when they can too. i just don't believe that will be systematically more than the vig,120
12Xpert,someone will have to lose money on the end. with gambling markets usually it's a much bigger percentage than those who win.,123
12Xpert,if people hadn't invested in it we wouldn't even be talking about this now. so perhaps we're actually dealing with survivorship bias.,133

12Xpert,actually i dont think you need to exactly quantify your edge for every bet to make it work. just the average.,109

12Xpert,well we've already been there. the icu cleared him of testing positive for excess salbutamol. make of that what you will.,121

12Xpert,that's where infinity takes you and why cantor went mad. still it could be worse he could have been a gooner,108

12Xpert,ok i see. perhaps average would be better in this case to avoid the confusion. like the charts though,101
12Xpert,which would imply he's not happy about what the traders did and will get them to stop it right?,95
12Xpert,these numbers are not evidence that vast numbers of bettors are unscrupulously encouraged to lose large sums of money.,118
12Xpert,if they do then that is another story to this one and again one that can be legislated for.,91
12Xpert,no idea. he must have the data ordered differently to me. here's 2 0 1 9  on its own.,85
12Xpert,if by large sample size you mean 1 0 0 0 0  then no not that i can remember.,76
12Xpert,"""efficiency"" is like will-o'-the-wisp: we think we know what it is but it always seems to elude our grasp.",106
12Xpert,indeed winning is irrelevant. i actually had a negative balance at that shitshow ladbrokes when they closed my account.,119
12Xpert,football racing still at 2  % . that will be 8 0  to 9 0  %  of their turnover.,79
12Xpert,exactly how it works in europe. sometimes they don't even let you buy the milk you came in for.,95
12Xpert,what i am is what dr tamsin edwards ( is. have a read of her thoughtful piece to understand.,92
12Xpert,error bars are almost always missing and where present are massively underestimated. we don't know what we don't know.,118
12Xpert,"""only extends to humans."" by implication you are suggesting she isn't one. that's what the nazis did to jews.",109
12Xpert,indeed but the spread price does away with all of that because it's implicitly 5 0 -5 0 .,89
12Xpert,obviously i'm data mining here and nothing is really very significant but again everything is in the right direction.,117
12Xpert,ahh right i get you. good question. i'd have to re-run the monte carlo. i'll give it a go.,90
12Xpert,in low or near zero validity domains like stock picking and sports betting intuition can easily lead you astray.,112
12Xpert,love you both. watching terminator as i wait for arsenal to fuck this up. you both know they can.,97
12Xpert,yes it makes sense. although i suspect my method published in the pinny article will do it much quicker.,104
12Xpert,it's already heavily regulated more than most other countries. would you ban the advertising of gambling in horse racing?,121
12Xpert,"""tipsters results dis. and coin toss dis.are not equal.""
they looked pretty equal to me when i studied them.",108
12Xpert,if you're talking about punters lounge then i'm not responsible for that site you would need to ask them.,105
12Xpert,which would imply he got very lucky because almost all the others who behaved like him will have failed.,104
12Xpert,no they are when i collect the odds (typically friday afternoon for weekend games tuesday morning for midweek games).,117
12Xpert,so if true odds are 1 8 0  your expected value is 2 8 0 /1 8 0 .,64
12Xpert,"you'd have your betting accounts closed long before you got there unless you take ""measures"" to disguise your activity.",119
12Xpert,"weekend woc matches available:

after reims victory away at psg midweek record is now marginally ahead of expectation again.",124
12Xpert,these will be games awarded by the fa mostly likely because the matches were abandoned due to crowd trouble.,108
12Xpert,wta tennis data up to date: hiroshima nanchang and zhengzhou. no atp this week on account of davis cup.,103
12Xpert,given the size of the inefficiency i don't think it can explain everything but at least it's a start.,101
12Xpert,the fact this question is even been asked hypothetically implies it's already over for arsenal. welcome to the wilderness.,122
12Xpert,i hope he's not bluffing. this needs to be ended no matter how. endless can kicking serves nobody's interests.,110
12Xpert,is this directed at me? if so my memory must be failing me. what are we talking about here?,91
12Xpert,time is kick-off uk local time so gmt from late october to late march +1  british summer time otherwise.,104
12Xpert,the reasons have already been given. anyway it's more likely that i won't be dropping the other 4 .,99
12Xpert,it would also make him britain's first ever grand tour winner ahead of  pro cycling you gotta love it.,102
12Xpert,entertaining? in theory it's the crowds who pay their salaries. if they stop watching the sponsors stop funding them.,117
12Xpert,full credit goes to  for proposing the idea to utilise maximum likelihood estimation to find the optimal betting model.,119
12Xpert,you obviously haven't the slightest idea what i am talking about and i also suspect probably you as well.,105
12Xpert,they are all hopeless when it comes to the customer/affiliate. they couldn't care less. they just pay lip service.,114
12Xpert,yes that's precisely it. and not suggest that you can win by being savvy sharp or smart on telly.,97
12Xpert,so in the above bet3 6 5  contributes about 8 0  %  5 3 8  about 2 0  % ,72
12Xpert,the most significant issue for a punter will be how to protect their recreational bookmaker accounts from being closed.,119
12Xpert,i use bbc results for the stats perhaps thats why theres a difference. ill check when i get back.,97
12Xpert,yes it was 9  % . for sure time is always the great leveller or should that be chance?,86
12Xpert,depends on your risk preferences and whether you aspire to / are capable of showing real profitable expected value.,115
12Xpert,oddsportal has closing odds most readily accessible. how reliable they are as real closing odds i do not know.,110
12Xpert,"yes you can. all hangs on the word ""decent"". is it really? that's the 6 4  million dollar question.",99
12Xpert,the draw a value bet in theory since 1 9 9 9  in practice since 2 0 1 2,71
12Xpert,unfortunately i can't help the code is provided by  so you will need to speak to him about it.,94
12Xpert,either the bettor has been lucky or the closing lines are not accurate (the odds are still too long).,101
12Xpert,when we do fat-tailed maths we also have to apply it to behavioural responses to the initial fat-tailed problem.,112
12Xpert,everything that happens in roulette is luck. there is no strategy at all. to say anything else is lie.,102
12Xpert,this is what a us air travel ban on non us citizens travelling from schengen countries currently looks like.,108
12Xpert,but indeed those who do and that's currently a lot could fall foul and i'd like to see that.,92
12Xpert,far more people will lose money believing pipe dreams sold by delusional tipsters than those discovering the holy grail.,120
12Xpert,"heres the omnibet record. 

7 5 0 + bets analysed to level stakes returned 0 .3 4  % .",86
12Xpert,ad hominem attacks are ultimately self-defeating. they are equivalent to admitting that you have lost the argument. well done.,126
12Xpert,because noise cancels out leaving the signal. very few people are capable of seeing the signal through the noise.,113
12Xpert,i wonder if the way people answered in your poll correlates to the way people have answered in mine?,100
12Xpert,in the end brexit won't change immigration in the slightest it will just shift the distribution of who's coming.,112
12Xpert,what for? i already did this for homes and aways which for the most part are favourites and underdogs.,102
12Xpert,great the worked examples really helped. i'd never have got from the formula to this on my own. thanks.,103
12Xpert,they don't care. that's the point. they just virtue signal morally criticising the very products that make their profit.,120
12Xpert,how far away from efficiency do you think you can move a line/probability before square money starts to notice?,111
12Xpert,and ask yourself: if youre buying (backing) whos selling (laying) and might it be they are smarter than you?,108
12Xpert,here's a synopsis which broadly makes the same conclusions i arrived at in my book on why people gamble.,104
12Xpert,but you cant be sure someone on the other side to you doesnt have a better model than yours.,92
12Xpert,we dont but if i had access to a larger sample id happily wager it would show very similar.,91
12Xpert,it's just as would be expected based on a normal distribution of possible 5 0 0 -bet sample rois.,97
12Xpert,perhaps alternatively if it is true its an argument in favour of a very small percentage of sharp bettors.,106
12Xpert,actually the anchoring effect might be an explanation for why there are hidden systematic biases at the single-point resolution.,128
12Xpert,yes. you're essentially asking for the impossible. but similarly it's impossible to prove that it is a biased sample.,117
12Xpert,not sure i called anyone a joke just things that were said. anyway let's move on. the country has.,98
12Xpert,well it's an intriguing idea. i do start to wonder whether it might get a knick from occam's razor.,99
12Xpert,because they aren't that stupid. try laying liverpool to beat wolves at 2 .0 0  and see what happens.,101
12Xpert,"i'm sure adam smith would take issue with this ""race to the bottom"" perspective of capitalism. marx probably wouldn't.",118
12Xpert,"i was simply pointing out that ""can"" typically means ""hardly ever"" unless the customer isn't bothered about buying luck.",120
12Xpert,if we just look at the 3 8 3  players showing profits here's their distribution players ranked by profit.,105
12Xpert,impossible to know either way until others are allowed to scrutinise the data and the research methodology used here.,117
12Xpert,just double them. normal distribution is symmetric. could you still show when actual is over or under expected. thanks.,119
12Xpert,wednesdays results will be added tomorrow most probably late unless i find time to update during the day.,105
12Xpert,jesus daniel can't you just give a reds fan his moment. you sound as boring as i do.,84
12Xpert,"market may have caught up.
margin is more on longer odds if there's a favourite-longshot bias in effect.",104
12Xpert,extra leagues midweek results and weekend fixtures available. brazil odds not yet available will add when they are.,115
12Xpert,also leicester on boxing day. with the way liverpool are conceding right now i'd say it's highly unlikely.,106
12Xpert,whilst they play football as its meant to be played i think i will continue to indulge this.,92
12Xpert,that could be true but it doesn't really matter from the point of view of the woc methodology.,94
12Xpert,there will be a big favourite-longshot bias on this market so may just focus on the shortest prices.,100
12Xpert,i think theres a fairly wide body of evidence that now suggests markets are more accurate than polls.,101
12Xpert,well that's survivorship bias then because you're not seeing (or evening bother to look for) the other ones.,108
12Xpert,"if that many people asked i'd consider it. 
 have those data but you have to pay a subscription.",96
12Xpert,the relevant poll on what people think of labour's spending plans happens on the 1 2 th december.,97
12Xpert,i dont disagree with you. and betting is also meant to be fun even if it isnt profitable.,89
12Xpert,not clear how the scoring system works with ah odds. surely youd get different scores with different handicaps.,111
12Xpert,its still possible that its not real or that if it was real once its been exploited away.,89
12Xpert,i'm sure the same will be said of the next metric to follow it. everything has it's day.,88
12Xpert,based on those charts arsenal cant defend tottenham cant do anything and man united can go to hell.,99
12Xpert,that's reassuring to know. let me know what you think of the pinny article once they publish it.,96
12Xpert,no i don't other than whether they beat the closing line. if you know another one i'm listening.,96
12Xpert,i like that answer. in effect a fluctuating expected roi. how could we test it with a model?,92
12Xpert,so you'd agree then that 9 9  %  of punters show performances that would be distributed normally right?,103
12Xpert,i had to read that 5  times to get my head round that. still not sure i have.,77
12Xpert,evidence that you can't use one sharp bookmaker as a baseline to find value at another sharp bookmaker.,103
12Xpert,exactly what happens 1  in 2 6  weeks that should be happening 1  in 5 0 0 ?,76
12Xpert,behind paywall. i'm too tight to be able to read but i imagine the answer is pretty obvious.,92
12Xpert,did i ever say i would do this? bet of the day is basically silly. because of variance.,87
12Xpert,and here was me thinking society was actually starting to care about mental health. i must have misunderstood.,110
12Xpert,much reduced fixtures lists this weekend on account of internationals. here's the extra leagues. main leagues following later:,126
12Xpert,sorry i don't because i don't follow racing. someone posted it a few days ago on another thread.,96
12Xpert,she wont even know that she might have been cheating thats how sad this is. worse than armstrong.,97
12Xpert,you kind of have to feel sorry for paula. what else can she do being on nikes payroll.,86
12Xpert,i would expect them to say it controls too much uk market share. yes skybet would be included.,94
12Xpert,2  %  on profits for a market. so if you back/lay that's 2  %  on any trade profit.,83
12Xpert,you can't make it all legal because of the health implications and because athletes respond differently to doping.,114
12Xpert,further evidence if it were needed that top level sport is no longer about entertainment simply about money.,108
12Xpert,sorry i didn't update the chart title. that one should read 1 0 0 0 -bet running average.,89
12Xpert,i very much doubt it but best price held about 4  %  value according the the woc method.,88
12Xpert,"ok got it.

this is your level stakes bank for all your tips. yield 2 .4  % .",77
12Xpert,apparently there's a simple equation that's existed for hundreds of years that will save them from the ignominy,111
12Xpert,if the result had been opposite would you argue the same and insist there is a second referendum?,97
12Xpert,that is certainly a viewpoint and thankfully the regulatory system in the uk is dealing with any offenders.,107
12Xpert,"weekend extra leagues fixtures available:

bookies still slow to post argentinian games so only 2  included so far.",115
12Xpert,once per week usually sundays unless it's a grand slam then it's two weeks. basically after each tournament.,108
12Xpert,don't normally follow such thing but i suspect this one is going to be a lot of fun.,84
12Xpert,why do we gamble? irrationality and overconfidence.  a closer look and tries to answer this age old question:,109
12Xpert,really fascinating subject this. i suppose the next question is then how long does it take to evolve?,101
12Xpert,if you want to argue about something else then do it in another context. and don't be insulting.,96
12Xpert,if i had the data yes but i think  has already done this with respect to horse racing.,86
12Xpert,and if those operators can acquire more new customers working with affiliates who don't play by the rules?,106
12Xpert,i expect that betfair exchange and other in-play platforms would have suspended their betting markets during that period.,121
12Xpert,"""higher your odds the higher the margin"".
it's the other way round unless i'm missing your point here.",102
12Xpert,it is but it's in a very unfriendly format and hard to compile for stupid people like me.,89
12Xpert,until we know how they apply the margin we will be searching for black cats in dark places.,91
12Xpert,here you can see how they perform against 4  other uk bookmakers (again 1  times 2  football markets).,102
12Xpert,be amazed. that's how good pinny's closing odds are (on average) compared to everything else i've looked at.,108
12Xpert,2 . but would that be enough to turn a -2  %  margin into a -4  %  margin?,74
12Xpert,i've also explained why other bookmakers are worse e.g. they choose to be it suits their business model.,104
12Xpert,not surprised by the negative yield. here's my real-life example when i was following this model last summer:,109
12Xpert,will just take a bit of time getting the team names to match in the two data sets.,82
12Xpert,anyone with sufficient scraping skills willing to collect these forecasts and test them against opening and closing  odds?,122
12Xpert,this is a start. the variance is considered to be too high for most people's attitudes to risk.,95
12Xpert,well yes but could this be the real black swan? i mean in terms of the real economy.,84
12Xpert,is staying alive the only thing that matters? i think this is what bill shankly was on about.,93
12Xpert,did i tell you that you couldn't do something? trying to remember. perhaps you can let me know.,95
12Xpert,how many elo levels do you see here? sample size of bettors is 2 6 9 0 .,72
12Xpert,"kind of. and its fairly easy to see that almost all of them have no ""secrets"" to reveal.",88
12Xpert,probably offer it as a gimmick never believing theyll have to use it much because of their overconfidence.,106
12Xpert,you might need a fourth option soon: go insane when new legislation stops such events from going ahead.,103
12Xpert,counter-intuitively the mortality rate might actually go down. less driving and bad habits are possible explanations.. who knew.,128
12Xpert,further i wont take lectures about professional betting from a tipster who ten-folds their staking without any explanation.,123
12Xpert,if you mean actually from my own personal betting around low four figures. then i largely got banned.,101
12Xpert,alchemists astrologists soothsayers flat earthers conspiracists homeopaths gwyneth paltrow and holocaust deniers deal in the currency of anecdotes.,147
12Xpert,it is most useful for me when people disagree. that's how i try out new things and learn.,89
12Xpert,perhaps if you answer you could consider saying why you find them helpful or don't find them helpful.,101
12Xpert,probably the few blue dots below the line of o/c = 1  is due to small sample size.,82
12Xpert,but on average if the information is the same then on average the price movements will cancel out.,98
12Xpert,ricardian division of labour. absolutely no need to have political alignment for the only meaningful concept in economics.,122
12Xpert,mondays results and the midweek fixtures will be available a little later today not later than 5 pm.,100
12Xpert,well toenail fungus kind of isn't a relevant variable for total nba points. mind you there's a thought....,106
12Xpert,"djokovic always finds a ""way"" it's just his way. if the rules allow it then he'll exploit them.",95
12Xpert,ok i've found the detailed stats for  indeed they imply they are 9 9  %  paid and fake.,87
12Xpert,in that case the answer is no i simply assume piinny odds with margin removed = true odds.,90
12Xpert,"and just to be clear part 2 :

""loser"" = expected loss.

we are not talking about luck.",87
12Xpert,i'm not entirely clear how quoting those numbers changes the difficulty of the work required to realise them.,109
12Xpert,if you can provide a source for those french figures then we can start a debate about it.,89
12Xpert,could a sharp book survive with a 2  %  margin and 5  %  of its customers being sharp?,86
12Xpert,well that's my worry. when that happens how fast and how many? that's why it's not for me.,90
12Xpert,my favourite tweet of 2 0 2 0  so far. can i have it for my facebook profile?,77
12Xpert,how do you know it wasn't your society that became ugly for other reasons and then introduced gambling?,103
12Xpert,might as well. i just need the actual rois expected rois and the roi standard deviation columns. thanks.,104
12Xpert,mind you given that it was ladbrokes pretty much anything they say and do is horse shit.,88
12Xpert,there's always debate. if there's no debate life gets boring. at least it does for a bayesian.,94
12Xpert,if the aim was to predict goals scored then surely it's relevant to include it if necessary.,92
12Xpert,sorry for late reply. the latest fixtures were there. maybe you need to clear your browser cache.,97
12Xpert,i'm surprised i'd have thought you'd demand a positive clv week not a week judged on profits.,93
12Xpert,no favourite-longshot bias. here's a bit more explanation for why it might not be present at exchanges.,103
12Xpert,suppose instead of ge poll by survation or yougov we had them from igindex sportingindex or betfair?,100
12Xpert,spain 2 nd kicks off 1 1 am tomorrow so main leagues fixtures will be available early.,86
12Xpert,i market might be inefficient if the bookmaker can make more money by having it that way.,89
12Xpert,let do sheffield utd to win both halves v newcastle thursday night premiership. current price 5 .5,98
12Xpert,quite a lot actually. average days lost per tenure-year rises from 1 4  to 1 8 .,80
12Xpert,"and after screwing up my entry formbets from austria and switzerland available  .  
data by   thank you!",104
12Xpert,it will be soft (recreational) bookmakers not pinnacle. pinnacle is the basis of calculating the 'true' prices.,111
12Xpert,in case you missed it and might be interested my take on the maths of consecutive losses.,89
12Xpert,going to have to ask you where i find it. you see i told you i'm stupid.,72
12Xpert,i suppose it depends how you look at it. here's a couple of charts that are relevant.,85
12Xpert,if i knew those trends and no one else knew them i'd be a very rich man.,72
12Xpert,that's already been established. which is what makes this so funny. you win some you lose some.,95
12Xpert,personally im not selling anything. i gave woc away freely. up to others how they use it.,89
12Xpert,"for football yes. explained here longish read:

other big sports/leagues probably yes too.  offer a subscription package.",121
12Xpert,if theyre mature enough to vote theyre mature enough to gamble buy alcohol and look at pornography.,99
12Xpert,retweeting coz i think it's important. if you like this stuff a lot more in my book.,84
12Xpert,"to be fair you're right. 
i think  knows what he's talking about. certainly more than i do.",91
12Xpert,1 /1 0  is not enough to rule out the possibility that they have a genuine skill.,81
12Xpert,no i haven't seen it. where it is? i thought you had to register to access it.,78
12Xpert,with the new  season underway    look at is there bias in the nba total points betting market?,94
12Xpert,i know they exist. the question is how many as a proportion of the total player population.,91
12Xpert,just did it. i can't believe i'm having this conversation about blanket betting of all away wins.,97
12Xpert,look at my wocs record. stretches of loss-making lasting thousands of bets but the system is proven.,100
12Xpert,brexit delaying tactics. they have done really well. only needs one black swan and then it's over.,98
12Xpert,at least it doesn't if a jury has cleared you of an offence you were accused of.,80
12Xpert,yes that's true. but that's probably the best one can do unless you have tamed laplace's demon.,95
12Xpert,some advice  if youre going to be an asshole be a consistent asshole. and dont mess with,88
12Xpert,same in financial investment. squares sell on dips and buy in surges and systematically miss-time their trading.,112
12Xpert,a shout-out to  for compiling an excellent database that we used in first publication. thank you joseph!,104
12Xpert,certainly for racing i would be utterly amazed since its a well established phenomenon in that market.,102
12Xpert,the likes of tom watson have already be found wanting when taking this holier than thou approach.,97
12Xpert,linked to illegal streaming cockfighting pornhub casino bets on children's sports criminal gangs. couldn't make it up.,118
12Xpert,they're going after kyc via agent accounts now going to be increasingly hard to get to pinnacle/asians.,103
12Xpert,overconfidence will almost certainly be an evolutionary adaptive behaviour. there's even a paper about it in nature.,116
12Xpert,who knows. all deals require concessions and if you don't get what you want you walk away.,90
12Xpert,about to do it. was just waiting for yesterday's games to finish and forgot to update yesterday.,96
12Xpert,roughly what percentage of punters make money from long term markets? i'd love to see the data.,95
12Xpert,of course the danger of adding more and more factors must surely increase the risk of overfitting.,98
12Xpert,been waiting for this one to go live. one of my favourite ever  articles courtesy of  and,89
12Xpert,"i hope no one is getting the idea that i am some kind of +ev sharp. 

joseph",76
12Xpert,are you going to explain why 9 0 0 0  bets on the major leagues follow woc?,75
12Xpert,impossible to estimate because there is nothing tracked so really no way of making any meaningful estimate.,107
12Xpert,1 0  times it's still probably variance.  know that which is why these ads are getting banned.,94
12Xpert,if you then have to sell your shirt after another 2 0 0  then you understood nothing.,85
12Xpert,it tells you the probability that something can happen by chance assuming nothing else is going on.,99
12Xpert,would those vegas odds have been the ones available at the same time as  published their predictions?,101
12Xpert,i would say almost all pinnacle bettors are kidding themselves if they believe they can do this.,96
12Xpert,and if that's the case beating the market becomes largely a coin flipping exercise (for almost everyone).,105
12Xpert,more on sportsbooks balancing train spotting at crewe patterns trends  and what it takes to be convinced,104
12Xpert,have they published data on how well their model has performed in terms of actual betting returns?,98
12Xpert,it might well be. imo it's a stupid business position to adopt since it effectively penalises loyalty,101
12Xpert,agreed the moralists should be telling that to the tens of thousands who will lose their jobs.,94
12Xpert,but unless you're the first to bet the opening line you are potentially betting against other people.,101
12Xpert,i thought it had gone behind closed doors. if its stopped completely would this industry even survive?,102
12Xpert,"i get into trouble saying things like this. 

i'm sure there's a few.  will vouch for that.",91
12Xpert,i basically agree with you but it just makes me question how people really value their lives.,93
12Xpert,the problem is there are no signs around the stock exchange saying 'when the fun stops stop.',93
12Xpert,"applies in tennis as in any other relative skill competition.

how about testing the claim with data.",101
12Xpert,so youre saying the value in wo is not available at  what a loser you are miguel,80
12Xpert,"no different.

how ironic given all the shit that fdc have given to people over the years.",90
12Xpert,it's bit garbage for the last 1 2  months. but that's no different to what's happened before.,93
12Xpert,a decent overview of how to build your own spread/win probability conversion chart with maximum likelihood estimation:,118
12Xpert,i'll say it again. .try to pick out two samples randomly where you see such a difference.,89

12Xpert,obviously the effect is very small but over large numbers of matches it becomes hugely statistically significant.,113
12Xpert,of course but at least its a confirmation (of sorts) that a market is doing it's job.,85

12Xpert,well not in the uk because bookmakers won't allow sharps to play. exchanges are your only option.,97
12Xpert,show me an example that's worked. scandinavia doesn't count imo it's basically capitalism with a social conscience.,115

12Xpert,so what do those two figures and the difference between then tell me about market efficiency?,93
